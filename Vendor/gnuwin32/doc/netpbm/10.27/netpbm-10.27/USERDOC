Since May 2002, Netpbm does not have traditional man pages for
documentation.  BUT YOU CAN CONFIGURE NETPBM, IF YOU WANT, SO YOU GET
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME 'MAN' FUNCTION AS WITH A TRADITIONAL UNIX PACKAGE.

Netpbm's maintainer believes man pages are obsolete and too limiting,
and doesn't have time to maintain the documentation in multiple
formats.  So instead of classic nroff man page format, the Netpbm
documentation is available as HTML, with one HTML file per program,
plus some others.  The current user manual is accessible on the World
Wide Web at <http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc>, and if it's practical
for you, you should access it there instead of making a local copy.
This manual is always up to date.  It is not maintained on a release
schedule like the source code is, but rather updated continuously.
The user manual describes past Netpbm function as well as the present,
so you can use the current manual with old Netpbm code.


INSTALLING A LOCAL COPY OF DOCUMENTATION
----------------------------------------

If accessing the manual on the World Wide Web is not convenient for
you (for example, if you want to access it from a computer that is not
always connected to the Internet), just make a local copy of the web
site files using GNU Wget:

  wget --recursive --relative http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/

The above copies all the HTML files from the web site into your
current directory, under a subdirectory 'netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc'
that it creates.  You can browse those files directly with a web
browser.  If you don't have Wget, get it from
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget.  It is very useful.


GETTING COMMAND HELP WITH A "MAN" COMMAND
-----------------------------------------

You can get the same quick access to program documentation with this
HTML setup as with traditional man pages, using the Manweb program.
This works whether you use the www copy or a local copy of the HTML
files.  Manweb is distributed with Netpbm.  With Manweb and Netpbm
installed and configured appropriately (see below), you can type

  man netpbm

and get the top level page of the Netpbm user manual (with hyperlinks to
all the other pages), or

  man netpbm ppmtogif

or 

  man ppmtogif

to go straight to the Ppmtogif documentation.

Installnetpbm normally installs Manweb and the netpbm.url file that
Manweb needs to find the Netpbm documentation.  Through the Configure
dialog, or editing Makefile.config, you determine whether Manweb
accesses the master web copy or a local copy you installed.

Installnetpbm installs the program as 'manweb'.  If you want to invoke
it as 'man', you'll have to set that up yourself.  Perhaps with a
symbolic link from 'man' to 'manweb'.  Note that 'manweb' is mostly
backward compatible with 'man' so that this is a reasonable thing to
do.  Manweb can find documentation on the web, in HTML files, in GNU
info files, and in traditional man pages.


In a standard installation of Netpbm, Installnetpbm also creates a
traditional man page for every Netpbm program it installs, but the man
page just tells you to go to the HTML file.  This way, even if the "man"
program isn't capable of reading the HTML documentation and even if the
user doesn't know specifically where Netpbm documentation lives, he isn't
stranded without information.


VIEWING NETPBM DOC WITH TRADITIONAL MAN PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------

Some people want to be able to access the Netpbm documentation with an
existing man program that doesn't know HTML.  You can install the
documentation that way, with some loss of quality.  There are two
ways:

  1) convert the HTML to troff with the 'makeman' program in the
     'buildtools' directory of the Netpbm source tree.  This is a 
     Python program.

  2) convert the HTML to formatted plain text (suitable as man "cat"
     pages) with the 'makecat' program in the 'buildtools' directory
     of the Netpbm source tree.  This program just does a 
     'lynx -dump'.

The "loss of quality" mentioned above is because:

  - The classic Unix manual format isn't as expressive as the
    worldwide web format; you can't convert down losslessly.

  - There is less maintenance effort put into maintaining the
    secondary non-web format.  It requires certain idioms to be
    followed in the HTML source and lists of man pages to be
    separately maintained.  This maintenance is essentially done on a
    fault basis -- when someone notices the Unix man pages aren't
    right, he fixes something.
    
    Bear in mind that the person who writes most of the Netpbm
    documentation updates never sees the troff versions; he uses
    Manweb, which renders directly from the HTML.

Also, these methods require manual effort, and technical
understanding, on your part to set up.  Setting it up is too complex
for an automated process to do it for you with any significant
integrity.  The examples are guidelines and you shouldn't expect them
to work literally in your situtation.

Here is an example of making troff pages:

  mkdir netpbmdoc
  cd netpbmdoc
  wget --recursive --relative http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/
  cd netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc
  PATH="/usr/src/netpbm/buildtools/:$PATH"
  make -f /usr/src/netpbm/buildtools/Makefile.manpage manpages
  make -f /usr/src/netpbm/buildtools/Makefile.manpage installman
  cd ../../..
  rm -r netpbmdoc

  man ppmtogif

Here is an example of making "cat" pages:

  mkdir netpbmdoc
  cd netpbmdoc
  wget --recursive --relative http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/
  cd netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc
  /usr/src/netpbm/buildtools/makecat *.html
  cp *.1 /usr/man/cat1/
  cd ../../..
  rm -r netpbmdoc

  man ppmtogif


DOCBOOK
-------

You can turn the Netpbm user manual into Docbook XML pages using
Doclifter.  Because Doclifter works on troff pages, you have to
convert the documentation down to troff first, which means the Docbook
pages are of lower quality than the main HTML documentation.

To create Docbook XML, follow the example above for creating troff
pages, and use 'make xmlpages' instead of 'make manpages'.
