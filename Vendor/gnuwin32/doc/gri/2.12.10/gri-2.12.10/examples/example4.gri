# Note that the x-grid was irregular.  The y-grid
# in this example is regular, so we can just set
# it to range from 10 to 20, incrementing by 2.5.
set y grid 10 20 2.5
# Thus we now have a grid 3 wide and 5 high.  Let's
# read the actual data now.

# Now draw contours (automatically set; we could
