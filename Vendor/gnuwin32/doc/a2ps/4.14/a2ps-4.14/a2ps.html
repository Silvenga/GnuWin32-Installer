<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<!-- Now, that's what I call humor :) -->
<p><a name="index-First-Page-1"></a>This document describes GNU a2ps version 4.14.  The latest
versions may be found on the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/a2ps/">a2ps<!-- home page -->
</a>. 
We plan to update the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/a2ps/">GNU a2ps<!-- home page -->
</a> in the near future, in which case the latter will be
a better source of information.

   <p>We tried to make this document informative and pleasant.  It tries to be
more than a plain reference guide, and intends to offer information
about the concepts or tools etc. that are related to printing
PostScript.  This is why it is now that big: to offer you all the
information you might want, <strong>not</strong> because a2ps is
difficult to use.  See <a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a>, for technical words or even general
information.

   <p>Please, send us emailcards <code>:)</code>. Whatever the comment is, or if you
just like a2ps, write to <a href="mailto:Miguel.Santana@st.com">Miguel Santana</a> and <a href="mailto:akim@freefriends.org">Akim Demaille</a>.  But
<em>never</em> write to either of us for asking questions, or to report
bugs.  Chances are very high never to receive an answer, as we receive
too many messages.  See <a href="#a2ps-Mailing-Lists">a2ps Mailing Lists</a>, for information on the
mailing lists.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Description</h3>

<p>a2ps formats files for printing on a PostScript printer.

   <p>The format used is nice and compact: normally two pages on each physical
page, borders surrounding pages, headers with useful information (page
number, printing date, file name or supplied header), line numbering,
pretty-printing, symbol substitution etc.  This is very useful for
making archive listings of programs or just to check your code in the
bus.  Actually a2ps is kind of bootstrapped: its sources are frequently
printed with a2ps <code>:)</code>.

   <p>While at the origin its names was derived from &ldquo;ASCII to PostScript&rdquo;,
today we like to think of it as &ldquo;Any to PostScript&rdquo;.  Indeed, a2ps
supports <dfn>delegations</dfn>, i.e., you can safely use a2ps to print DVI,
PostScript, LaTeX, JPEG etc., even compressed.

   <p>A short list of features of a2ps might look like this:
     <ul>
<li>Customizable through various configuration files (see <a href="#Configuration-Files">Configuration Files</a>)

     <li>Powerful escapes to define the headers, table of contents etc. the way you want
(see <a href="#Escapes">Escapes</a>);

     <li>Variables to push even further the customizability in a comfortable
manner (see <a href="#Your-Variables">Your Variables</a>);

     <li>Open approach of encodings (see <a href="#Encodings">Encodings</a>);

     <li>Excellent support of the Latin 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 encodings, thanks to
<code>Ogonkify</code> (see <a href="ogonkify.html#Top">Overview (Ogonkify manual)</a>),
written by Juliusz Chroboczek.

     <li>Fully customizable output style: fonts, background and foreground
colors, line numbering style etc. (see <a href="#Designing-PostScript-Prologues">Designing PostScript Prologues</a>).

     <li>Possibility to delegate the processing of some files to other filters
(see <a href="#Your-Delegations">Your Delegations</a>).

     <li>Many contributions, e.g., pretty-print diffs, print reference cards of
programs, sanitize broken PostScript files, print Duplex on Simplex
printers etc. (see <a href="#Contributions">Contributions</a>).

     <li>And finally, the ability to pretty-print sources written in quite a
few various languages (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing">Pretty Printing</a>). 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">1.2 Reporting Bugs</h3>

<p><a name="index-Bug-2"></a>We try hard to make a2ps portable on any Unix platform, and bug free. 
But sometimes there can still be bad surprises, even after having
compiled and checked a2ps on several very different platforms.

   <p>You may encounter some of these problems yourself.  In any case, please
never abandon without giving us a chance.  We need information from
everybody so that mistakes get fixed as fast as possible.

   <p>So, if you have a problem (configuration error, compilation error,
runtime error, documentation error or unclear), first check in the FAQ
(see <a href="#FAQ">FAQ</a>), then on the page <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/a2ps//bugs.html">Known a2ps<!-- Bugs -->
</a> if the issue has not been addressed yet.  If it is not the
case, but it appears that the version of a2ps you have is old,
consider upgrading.

   <p>If the problem persists, send us a mail (<a href="mailto:bug-a2ps@gnu.org">bug-a2ps@gnu.org</a>)
which subject is <span class="samp">a2ps </span><var>version</var><span class="samp">: </span><var>short-description</var> and
which content mentions the name of your machine and OS, the version of
a2ps, every detail you have on your compiler, and as much traces as
possible (the error messages you get on the screen, or the output of
<code>make</code> when it fails etc.).

   <p>Be sure to get a quick answer.

<h3 class="section">1.3 a2ps Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>There are several mailing lists related to a2ps:

     <dl>
<dt><a href="mailto:a2ps@gnu.org">a2ps@gnu.org</a><dd>This list is dedicated to announcements, questions/answers, etc. 
The alpha versions are announced too.  Requests and suggestions can be
sent there.

     <br><dt><a href="mailto:bug-a2ps@gnu.org">bug-a2ps@gnu.org</a><dd>Any bug report should be sent to this address.  Please, be sure to state
the version of a2ps in the subject of your message, together with a
short description of the problem.  In the body of the message, include
all the information that might be relevant: the system you run, etc.

     <br><dt><a href="mailto:a2ps-patches@gnu.org">a2ps-patches@gnu.org</a><dd>Send patches, style sheets, new delegations etc. to this list.  In other
words, any candidate for inclusion into a2ps should be sent to this
list.  It also serves to coordinate the developers.  If you are
interested in the development of a2ps, then visit the
<a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/a2ps/">Savannah a2ps page</a>.

     <br><dt><a href="mailto:a2ps-commit@gnu.org">a2ps-commit@gnu.org</a><dd>Each time a change is made the main a2ps repository, a message is
sent to this mailing list.  For developers only. 
</dl>

   <p>To subscribe to any of these list, go to their web pages:
<a href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/a2ps">a2ps</a>,

and <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/a2ps-patches">a2ps-commit</a>.

   <p>Be sure <em>never</em> to send a private message to one of the authors, as
it is approximately the best means never to get an answer.  In addition
it is counter productive for the community, as the answer to your
question might have interested more people.

<h3 class="section">1.4 Helping the Development</h3>

<p>If you like a2ps and if you feel like helping, there are several things
you can do.

     <dl>
<dt><em>Testing</em><dd>You just can't imagine how hard it is to make sure that the program that
works perfectly here will work on your machine.  Actually, in general
the last weeks before a release are mostly dedicated to (Unix)
portability issues.

     <p>So we <strong>need</strong> beta-testers!  To be one is fairly simple: subscribe
to the mailing-list where the betas are announced and distributed.

     <br><dt><em>Translation</em><dd>The interface of a2ps is under <code>GNU gettext</code> which means that all
the messages can be translated, without having to look at the code of
a2ps: you don't need to be a programmer at all.  All the details are
available on <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/a2ps//po/">the a2ps translation page</a>.

     <br><dt><em>Style Sheets</em><dd>Since a2ps is evolving and getting more powerful, the style sheets
should be checked and improved.  There are too many so that the authors
work on them.  Therefore if you feel your favorite language is not
honored as it should be, improve the style sheet! (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing">Pretty Printing</a> for details.)

     <br><dt><em>Encodings</em><dd>a2ps is wide open to any 8-bit encoding.  If your language is not covered
today by a2ps, you can easily provide the support yourself. 
Honestly, the trickiest part is to find correct <strong>free</strong> fonts that
support your mother tongue (see <a href="#Encoding-Files">Encoding Files</a>, to know more).

     <br><dt><em>Fonts</em><dd>There are still some characters missing in Ogonkify. See
<a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jec/ogonkify/missing.html">the list of missing characters</a> and
<a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jec/ogonkify/">the Ogonkify home page</a> for details.

     <br><dt><em>Documentation</em><dd>If you feel something is missing or is unclear, send us your
contributions.

     <br><dt><em>Porting</em><dd>Porting a program to special architectures (MS-DOS, OS/2 etc.), or
building special packages (e.g., RPM) requires having an access to these
architectures.  If you feel like maintaining such a port, tell us.

     <br><dt><em>Features</em><dd>Well, if you feel like doing something else, go ahead!  But contact us,
because we have quite a big stack of things we want to do or have
started to do, and synchronizing might be useful.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Purpose</h3>

<p>a2ps is a program that takes a text file (i.e., human readable),
and makes a PostScript file out of it.  Typically output is sent to
a printer.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">2.2 How to print</h3>

<p>To print a file <span class="file">doc.txt</span>, just give it to a2ps: the default
setting should be the one you'd like:
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     gargantua ~ $ a2ps doc.txt
     [doc.txt (plain): 9 pages on 5 sheets]
     [Total: 9 pages on 5 sheets] sent to the default printer
     </td></tr></table>
</pre>
   <p>a2ps sent the file <span class="file">doc.txt</span> to the default printer, writing
two columns of text on a single face of the sheet.  Indeed, by default
a2ps uses the option <span class="samp">-2</span>, standing for two virtual pages.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 Basics for Printing</h4>

<p>Say you want to print the C file <span class="file">bar.c</span>, and its header
<span class="file">foo.h</span>, on 4 virtual pages, and save it into the file
<span class="file">foobar.ps</span>.  Just hit:
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     gargantua $ a2ps foo.h bar.c -4 -o foobar.ps
     [foo.h (C): 1 page on 1 sheet]
     [bar.c (C): 3 pages on 1 sheet]
     [Total: 4 pages on 2 sheets] saved into the file `foobar.ps'
     </td></tr></table>
</pre>
   <p>The option <span class="samp">-4</span> tells a2ps to make four virtual pages: two rows by
two columns.  The option <span class="samp">-o foobar.ps</span> (which is the short version of
<span class="samp">--output=foobar.ps</span>) specifies the output file. Long options
must always be separated by spaces, though short options with no
arguments may be grouped.

   <p>Note too that the options may be specified before or after the files, it
does not matter.

   <p>If you send <span class="file">foobar.ps</span> to a printer, you'll discover that the
keywords were highlighted, that the strings and comments have a
different face.  Indeed, a2ps is a <dfn>pretty-printer</dfn>: if it knows the
(programming) language in which your file is written, it will try to make
it look nice and clear on the paper.

   <p>But too bad: <span class="file">foo.h</span> is only one virtual page long, and
<span class="file">bar.c</span> takes three.  Moreover, the comments are essential in those
files.  And even worse: the system's default printer is out of ink. 
Thanks god, precious options may help you:
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     gargantua $ a2ps -4 -Av foo.h bar.c --prologue=gray -P lw
     [foo.h (C): 1 page on 1 sheet]
     [bar.c (C): 3 pages on 1 sheet]
     [Total: 4 pages on 1 sheet] sent to the printer `lw'
     </td></tr></table>
</pre>
   <p>Here the option <span class="samp">-A</span> is a short cut for the option
<span class="samp">--file-align</span> which specifies how different files should be
separated.  This option allows several symbolic arguments:
<span class="samp">virtual</span>, <span class="samp">rank</span>, <span class="samp">page</span>, <span class="samp">sheet</span> (See <a href="#Sheet-Options">Sheet Options</a>, for more details).  The value <span class="samp">virtual</span> means not to
start each file on a different virtual pages.

   <p>So to fill the page is asked by <span class="samp">--file-align=virtual</span>, or <span class="samp">-A
virtual</span>.  But symbolic arguments can be abbreviated when there are no
ambiguity, so here, you can just use <span class="samp">-Av</span>.

   <p>The option <span class="samp">-P lw</span> means to print on the printer named <span class="samp">lw</span>,
and finally, the long option <span class="samp">--prologue</span> requires the use one of
the alternative printing styles.  There are other prologues (See <a href="#Input-Options">Input Options</a>, option <span class="samp">--prologue</span>), and you can even design yours
(see <a href="#Designing-PostScript-Prologues">Designing PostScript Prologues</a>).

   <p>The first one, <code>void</code>, sends the output to the trash. 
Its main use is to see how many pages would have been used.
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     gargantua ~ $ a2ps -P void parsessh.c
     [parsessh.c (C): 33 pages on 17 sheets]
     [Total: 33 pages on 17 sheets] sent to the printer `void'
     </td></tr></table>
</pre>
   <p>The second, <code>display</code> sends the output to <code>Ghostview</code>, so that
you can check the output without printing.  Of course if you don't have
<code>Ghostview</code>, it won't work...  And it is up to you to configure
another displaying application (see <a href="#Your-Printers">Your Printers</a>).

   <p>The last, <code>file</code> saves the output into a file named after the
file you printed (e.g., saves into <span class="file">foo.ps</span> when you print
<span class="file">foo.c</span>).

<div class="node">

<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.3 Using Delegations</h4>

<p>a2ps can decide that a2ps itself is not the right tool to do what you want. 
In that case it delegates the task to other programs.  What you should
retain from this, is, <em>forget that there are delegations</em>.  Indeed,
the interface with the delegations has been designed so that you don't
need to be aware that they exist to use them.  Do as usual.

   <p>As an example, if you need to print a PostScript file, just hit:
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     gargantua ~ $ a2ps article.ps -d
     [article.ps (ps, delegated to PsNup): 7 pages on 4 sheets]
     [Total: 8 pages on 4 sheets] sent to the default printer
     </td></tr></table>
</pre>
   <p>While honoring your defaults settings, a2ps delegates the task to put
two virtual pages per physical page to <code>psnup</code>, a powerful filter
part of the famous <code>psutils</code> by Angus Duggan.

   <p>Suppose now that you want to display a Texinfo file. Then, provided you
have all the programs a2ps needs, just hit
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     gargantua ~ $ a2ps a2ps.texi -P display
     [a2ps.texi (texinfo, delegated to texi2dvi): 75 pages on 38 sheets]
     [Total: 76 pages on 38 sheets] sent to the printer `display'
     </td></tr></table>
</pre>
   <p>Once the read documentation, you know you want to print just pages
10 to 20, plus the cover.  Just hit:
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     gargantua ~ $ a2ps a2ps.texi --pages=1,10-20 -d
     [a2ps.texi (texinfo, delegated to texi2dvi): 13 pages on 7 sheets]
     [Total: 14 pages on 7 sheets] sent to the default printer
     </td></tr></table>
</pre>
   <p>A final word: compressed files can be treated in the very same way:
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     gargantua ~ $ a2ps a2ps.texi.gz -a1,10-20 -d
     [a2ps.texi (compressed, delegated to Gzip-a2ps): 13 pages on 7 sheets]
     [Total: 14 pages on 7 sheets] sent to the default printer
     </td></tr></table>
</pre>
   <p>You should be aware that:
     <ul>
<li>the option <span class="samp">-Z</span> enables the delegations if they are not (see
<span class="samp">--list=defaults</span> for your settings);

     <li>the set of delegations is customizable, to know the delegations your
a2ps knows, consult <span class="samp">a2ps --list=delegations</span>. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.4 Printing Duplex</h4>

<p>If you still want to save more paper, and you are amongst the set of
happy users of Duplex printers, a2ps will also be able to help you
(See <a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a>, for definitions).  The option to specify Duplex
printing is <span class="samp">--sides=</span><var>mode</var> (see <a href="#PostScript-Options">PostScript Options</a>).

   <p>Here is how to print the documentation in Duplex and send it to the
Duplex printer <span class="samp">margot</span>:
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     quasimodo ~ a2ps/doc $ a2ps -s2 -Pmargot a2ps.texi
     [a2ps.texi (texinfo, delegated to texi2dvi): 109 pages on 28 sheets]
     [Total: 110 pages on 28 sheets] sent to the printer `margot'
     </td></tr></table>
</pre>
   <p>This is also valid for several files.

   <p>Actually, you can do something even more tricky: print a small book! 
This is much more complicated than printing Duplex, because the pages
needs to be completely reorganized another way.  This is precisely the
job of <code>psbook</code>, yet another PsUtil from Angus Duggan.  But there
is a user option which encapsulates the magic sequence of options:
<span class="samp">book</span>.  Therefore, just run
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     quasimodo a2ps/doc $ a2ps -=book -Pmargot a2ps.texi
     [a2ps.texi (texinfo, delegated to texi2dvi): 109 pages on 109 sheets]
     [Total: 109 pages on 109 sheets] sent to the printer `margot'
     </td></tr></table>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and <i>voila` !</i>, a booklet printed on margot!

   <p>We strongly discourage you to try with several files at once, because
the tools then easily get lost.  And, after all, the result will be
exactly the same once you collated all the booklets together.

   <p>Another limitation is that this does not work if it is not sent to a
printer.  This kind of weird limitations will be solved in the future.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.5 Checking the Defaults</h4>

<p>If a2ps did not have the behavior expected, this may be because of
the default settings given by your system administrator.  Checking
those default values is easy:
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>

       borders         = yes
       file alignment  = page

   <p>Remember that the on-line help is always available.  Moreover, if your

<h3 class="section">2.3 Important parameters</h3>

<p>Many things are parameterizable in a2ps, but two things are just
essential to make sure everything goes right:
     <dl>
<dt><strong>The paper</strong><dd>Make sure that the paper a2ps uses is the same as your printer
(See <a href="#Sheet-Options">Sheet Options</a>, option <span class="samp">--medium</span>).

     <br><dt><strong>The encoding</strong><dd>Make sure that the <em>encoding</em> a2ps uses is the same as the
standard alphabet in your country (See <a href="#Input-Options">Input Options</a>, option
<span class="samp">--encoding</span>). 
</dl>

   <p>Both values may be checked with <span class="samp">a2ps --list=defaults</span>.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">2.4 Localizing</h3>

<p>a2ps provides some Native Language Support, that is speaking your
mother tongue.  It uses three special features for non-English
languages:
     <dl>
<dt><em>the tongue</em><dd>i.e., the language used by the interface,

     <br><dt><em>the date</em><dd>i.e., the format and the words used in the language to specify a date. 
</dl>

   <p>To enable these features, properly set your environment variable
<code>LANG</code> (see the documentation of your system, for instance
<span class="samp">man locale</span>, <span class="samp">man environ</span> etc.).

   <p>The problem with this approach is that a lot more than just messages and
time information is affected: especially the way numbers are written
changes, what may cause problems with <code>awk</code> and such.

   <p>So if you just want messages and time format to be localized, then
define:
<pre class="example">     set LC_MESSAGES=fr ; export LC_MESSAGES
     set LC_TIME=fr     ; export LC_TIME

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.5.1 Interfacing With a Mailer</h4>

<p>When you print from a mailer (or a news reader), your mailer calls a tool,
say a2ps on a part of the whole mailbox.  This makes it difficult for
a2ps to guess that the file is of the type <span class="samp">mail</span>.  Therefore, for
better results, make sure to tell a2ps the files are mails.  The user
option <span class="samp">mail</span> (or <span class="samp">longmail</span> for longer inputs) encapsulates most
typical tuning users want to print mails (for instance, don't print all the
headers).

   <p>Most specifically, if your mailer is:
     <dl>
<dt><code>elm</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007belm_007d-6"></a>Once you are in elm, hit <kbd>o</kbd> to enter in the options edition menu,
hit <kbd>p</kbd> to edit the printer command, and enter <span class="samp">a2ps -=mail
%s -d</span>.  The option <span class="samp">-d</span> means to print on the default printer.

     <br><dt><code>pine</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bpine_007d-7"></a><a href="mailto:jan@chrillesen.dk">Jan Chrillesen</a> suggests us how to use a2ps
with the Pine mail-reader.  Add the following to <span class="file">.pinerc</span>
(of course you can put it in <span class="file">pine.conf</span> as well):
     <pre class="example">          # Your printer selection
          printer=a2ps -=mail -d
          
          # Special print command

<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.5.2 Netscape</h4>

<p>This is actually valid for any program that generates PostScript that
you want to post-process with a2ps.  Use the following command:
<pre class="example">     a2ps
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Not too hard, isn't it?

   <p>Nevertheless, this setting suppose your world is OK, your <code>file(1)</code>
detects correctly PostScript files, and your a2ps is configured to
delegate.  In case one one these conditions is not met, use:
<pre class="example">     a2ps -ZEps
</pre>
   <p>Do not forget to tell Netscape whether your printer supports colors, and
the type of paper it uses.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Invoking a2ps</h2>

<p>Calling a2ps is fairly simple:
<pre class="example">     a2ps <var>Options...</var> <var>Files...</var>
</pre>
   <p>If no <var>Files...</var> are given, a2ps prints its standard input.  If
<span class="samp">-</span> appears in the <var>Files...</var>, it designates the standard input
too.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#Options">Options</a>:                      Command line options
<li><a accesskey="2" href="#Escapes">Escapes</a>:                      Strings ready to use in the headers
</ul>

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Invoking-a2ps">Invoking a2ps</a>
<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">3.1 Command line options</h3>

<p><a name="index-Command-line-options-8"></a><a name="index-Options-9"></a>
To read the options and arguments that you give, a2ps uses GNU
<code>getopt</code>, hence:

     <ul>
<li>the options (short with arguments or long) must be separated by spaces.

     <li>the order between options and files does not matter: <span class="samp">a2ps -4m
main.c</span> and <span class="samp">a2ps main.c -4m</span> are identical.

     <li>the order between options <strong>does matter</strong>, especially between
options that influence the same parameters.  For instance <span class="samp">a2ps -1
-l132</span> is not the same as <span class="samp">a2ps -l132 -1</span> (the latter being
equivalent to <span class="samp">a2ps -1</span>).

     <li>short options may be grouped together: <span class="samp">a2ps -4mg main.c -P printer</span>

     <li>when there are no ambiguities, long options can be abbreviated, e.g.,
<span class="samp">--pro</span> will be understood as <span class="samp">--prologue</span>,

     <li><span class="samp">--</span> ends the options.  Anything behind <span class="samp">--</span> is considered to
be a file: <span class="samp">a2ps -- -2</span> prints the file <span class="file">-2</span><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   </ul>

   <p>Here after a <var>boolean</var> is considered as true (i.e. setting the
option on), if <var>boolean</var> is <span class="samp">yes</span>, or <span class="samp">1</span>; as false if it
equals <span class="samp">no</span> or <span class="samp">0</span>; and raise an error otherwise.  The
corresponding short option takes no arguments, but corresponds to a
positive answer.

   <p>When an argument is presented between square brackets, it means that it is
optional.  Optional arguments to short option must never be separated from the
option.

<h4 class="subsection">3.2.3 Available Escapes</h4>

<p>Supported escapes are:
     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">\\</span><dd>character <span class="samp">\</span>

     <br><dt><span class="samp">\%</span><dd>character <span class="samp">%</span>

here as <span class="samp">|</span>) may be any character.  <var>if_true</var> and
<var>if_false</var> may be defined exactly the same way as regular headers,
included escapes and the <span class="samp">#?</span> construct.

     <p>The available tests are:
          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">#?1</span><dt><span class="samp">#?2</span><dt><span class="samp">#?3</span><dd>true if tag 1, 2 or 3 is not empty.  See item <span class="samp">$t1</span> for
explanation.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">#?d</span><dd>true if Duplex printing is requested (<span class="samp">-s2</span>).

          <br><dt><span class="samp">#?j</span><dd>true if bordering is asked (<span class="samp">-j</span>).

          <br><dt><span class="samp">#?l</span><dd>true if printing in landscape mode.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">#?o</span><dd>true if only one virtual page per page (i.e., <span class="samp">#v</span> is 1).

          <br><dt><span class="samp">#?p</span><dd>a page range has been specified (i.e., <span class="samp">#p</span> is not empty).

          <br><dt><span class="samp">#?r</span><dd>true if major is rows (<span class="samp">--major=rows</span>).

          <br><dt><span class="samp">#?v</span><dd>true if printing on the back side of the sheet (verso).

     <br><dt><span class="samp">#!</span><var>key</var><span class="samp">|</span><var>in</var><span class="samp">|</span><var>between</var><span class="samp">|</span><dd>Used for enumerations.  The separator (presented here as <span class="samp">|</span>) may
be any character.  <var>in</var> and <var>between</var> are escapes.

     <p>The enumerations may be:
          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">#!$</span><dd>enumeration of the command line options.  In this case <var>in</var> in never
used, but is replaced by the arguments.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">#!s</span><dd>enumeration of the files appearing in the current sheet.

     </dl>

     <p>For instance, the escapes <span class="samp">The files printed were: #!f|$n|,
|.</span> evaluated with input <span class="samp">a2ps NEWS main.c -o foo.ps</span>, gives
<span class="samp">The files printed were: NEWS, main.c.</span>.

     <p>As an exception, <span class="samp">#!</span> escapes use the <var>width</var> as the
maximum number of objects to enumerate if it is positive, e.g.,
<span class="samp">#10!f|$n|, |</span> lists only the ten first file names.  If <var>width</var>
is negative, then it does not enumerate the -<var>width</var> last objects
(e.g., <span class="samp">#-1!f|$n|, |</span> lists all the files but the last).

<h2 class="chapter">4 Configuration Files</h2>

<p><a name="index-Configuration-Files-133"></a><a name="index-_0040file_007b_002ea2ps_007d-134"></a><a name="index-_0040file_007ba2psrc_007d-135"></a><a name="index-_0040file_007ba2ps_002ecfg_007d-136"></a><a name="index-_0040file_007ba2ps_002dsite_002ecfg_007d-137"></a>
a2ps reads several files before the command line options.  In the
order, they are:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><a name="index-_0040samp_007bA2PS_005fCONFIG_007d-138"></a>the system configuration file (usually <span class="file">/usr/local/etc/a2ps.cfg</span>)
unless you have defined the environment variable <span class="samp">A2PS_CONFIG</span>, in
which case a2ps reads the file it points to;

     <li>the user's home configuration file (<span class="file">$HOME/.a2ps/a2psrc</span>)

     <li>the local file (<span class="file">./.a2psrc</span>)
        </ol>

   <p>Because a2ps needs architecture dependent information (such as the
local <code>lpr</code> command) and architecture independent information (such
as the type of your printers), users have found useful that
<span class="file">a2ps.cfg</span> be dedicated to architecture dependent information.  A
sub configuration file, <span class="file">a2ps-site.cfg</span> (see <a href="#Including-Configuration-Files">Including Configuration Files</a>) is included from <span class="file">a2ps.cfg</span>.

   <p>The file <span class="file">a2ps.cfg</span> is updated when you update a2ps, while
<span class="file">a2ps-site.cfg</span> is not, to preserve local definitions.

   <p>In the configuration files, empty lines and lines starting with <span class="samp">#</span>
are comments.

   <p>The other lines have all the following form:
<pre class="example">     <var>Topic:</var> <var>Arguments</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>Topic:</var> is a keyword related to what you are customizing, and
<var>Arguments</var> the customization.  <var>Arguments</var> may be spread on
several lines, provided that the last character of a line to continue is
a <span class="samp">\</span>.

   <p>In the following sections, each <var>Topic:</var> is detailed.

   <p>This is especially useful for the site specific configuration file
<span class="file">etc/a2ps.cfg</span>: you may tune your printers etc. in a separate file
for easy upgrade of a2ps (and hence of its configuration files).

<h3 class="section">4.2 Your Library Path</h3>

<p>To define the default library path, you can use:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Configuration Setting: <b>LibraryPath:</b><var> path<a name="index-LibraryPath_003a-141"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-_0040samp_007bLibraryPath_003a_007d-142"></a>Set the library path the <var>path</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Configuration Setting: <b>AppendLibraryPath:</b><var> path<a name="index-AppendLibraryPath_003a-143"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-_0040samp_007bAppendLibraryPath_003a_007d-144"></a>Add <var>path</var> at the end of the current library path. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Configuration Setting: <b>PrependLibraryPath:</b><var> path<a name="index-PrependLibraryPath_003a-145"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-_0040samp_007bPrependLibraryPath_003a_007d-146"></a>Add <var>path</var> at the beginning of the current library path. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Note that for users configuration files, it is better not to set the
library path, because the system's configuration has certainly been
built to cope with your system's peculiarities.  Use
<span class="samp">AppendLibraryPath:</span> and <span class="samp">PrependLibraryPath:</span>.

        <p>It is the correct way to define the default behavior you expect from
a2ps.  If for instance you want to use <code>Letter</code> as medium, then
use:

     <pre class="example">          Options: --medium=Letter
     </pre>

<p>In the PostScript file is dropped information on where sheets begin and

With this information can be also stored a label, i.e., a human readable text
(typically the logical page numbers), which
is for instance what <code>Ghostview</code> shows as the list of page numbers.

<p><a name="index-Predefined-Variables-173"></a><a name="index-Variables_002c-predefined-174"></a>
There are a few predefined variables.  The fact that a2ps builds them
at startup changes nothing to their status: they can be modified like
any other variable using <code>--define</code> (see <a href="#Global-Options">Global Options</a>).

   <p>In what follows, there are numbers (i) like this, or (ii) this.  It
means that a2ps first tries the solution (i), if a result is obtained
(non empty value), this is the value given to the variable.  Otherwise
it tries solution (ii), etc.  The rationale behind the order is usually
from user modifiable values (e.g. environment variables) through
system's hard coded values (e.g., calls to <code>getpwuid</code>) and finally
arbitrary values.

     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">user.comments</span><dd>Comments on the user.  Computed by (i) the system's database (the part
of <code>pw_gecos</code> after the first <span class="samp">,</span>), (ii) not defined.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">user.home</span><dd>The user's home directory.  Determined by (i) the environment variable
<code>HOME</code>, (ii) the system's database (using <code>getpwuid</code>), (iii)
the empty string.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">user.host</span><dd>The user's host name.  Assigned from (i) the system (<code>gethostname</code>
or <code>uname</code>), (ii) the empty string.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">user.login</span><dd>The user's login (e.g. <span class="samp">bgates</span>).  Computed by (i) the environment
variable <code>LOGNAME</code>, (ii) the environment variable <code>USERNAME</code>,
(iii) the system's database (using <code>getpwuid</code>), (iv) the translated
string <span class="samp">user</span>.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">user.name</span><dd>The user's name (e.g. <span class="samp">William Gates</span>).  Computed by (i) the
system's database (<code>pw_gecos</code> up to the first <span class="samp">,</span>), (ii)
capitalized value of the variable <span class="samp">user.login</span> unless it was the
translated string <span class="samp">user</span>, (iii) the translated string <span class="samp">Unknown

<h4 class="subsection">4.10.2 Guide Line for Delegations</h4>

<p>First of all, select carefully the applications you will use for the
delegations.  If a filter is known to cause problems, try to avoid it in
delegations<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.  As a thumb rule, you should check that the PostScript
generating applications produce files that start by:
<pre class="example">     %!PS-Adobe-3.0
</pre>
   <p>a2ps <strong>needs</strong> the <span class="samp">%%BeginSetup</span>-<span class="samp">%%EndSetup</span> section
in order to output correctly the page device definitions.  It can happen
that your filters don't output this section.  In that case, you should
insert a call to <code>fixps</code> right after the PostScript generation:
<pre class="example">     ########## ROFF files
     # Pass the roff files to groff.  Ask grog how groff should be called.
     # Use fixps to ensure there is a %%BeginSetup/%%EndSetup section.
     Delegation: Groff roff:ps	\
        eval `grog -Tps '$f'` | fixps #?V!!-q! | #{d.psselect} | #{d.psnup}
</pre>
   <p>There are some services expected from the delegations.  The delegations
you may write should honor:
     <dl>
<dt>the input file<dd>available via the escape <span class="samp">$f</span>.  You should be aware that there are
people who have great fun having spaces or dollars in their file names,
so you probably should always use <span class="samp">'$f'</span>.  Some other variables are
affected.  Yes, I know, we need a special mechanism for <span class="samp">'</span> itself. 
Well, we'll see that later <span class="samp">;-)</span>.

     <br><dt>the medium<dd>the dimension of the medium selected by the user are available through
<span class="samp">#w</span> and <span class="samp">#h</span>.

     <br><dt>the page layout<dd>the number of virtual pages is <span class="samp">#v</span>.

     <br><dt>the verbosity level<dd>please, do not make your delegations verbose by default.  The silent

   <p>If ever you need several commands, do not use <span class="samp">;</span> to separate them,
since it may prevent detection of failure.  Use <span class="samp">&amp;&amp;</span> instead.

   <p>The slogan "<em>the sooner, the better</em>" should be applied here: in
the processing chain, it is better to ask a service to the first
application that supports it.  An example will make it clear: when
processing a <code>DVI</code> file, <code>dvips</code> knows better the page numbers
than <code>psselect</code> would.  So a <code>DVI</code> to PostScript delegation
should ask the page selection (<span class="samp">#p</span>) to <code>dvips</code>, instead of
using <code>psselect</code> later in the chain.  An other obvious reason here
is plain efficiency (globally, less data is processed).

<h4 class="subsection">4.10.3 Predefined Delegations</h4>

<p>The purpose of this section is not to document all the predefined
delegations, for this you should read the comments in the system
configuration file <span class="file">a2ps.cfg</span>.  We just want to explain some choices,
and give hints on how to make the best use of these delegations.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Delegation: <b>dvips</b> (<var>DVI to PostScript</var>)<var><a name="index-dvips-178"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>There is a problem when you use a naive implementation of this
delegation: landscape jobs are not recognized, and therefore n-upping
generally fails miserably.  Therefore, a2ps tries to guess if the file
is landscape by looking for the keyword <span class="samp">landscape</span> in it, using
<code>strings(1)</code>:
     <pre class="example">          Delegation: dvips dvi:ps\
           if strings $f | sed 3q | fgrep landscape &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then \
             #{d.dvips} -T#hpt,#wpt $f -o #f0 &amp;&amp; #?o|cat|#{d.psnup} -r| #f0;\
           else \
             #{d.dvips} $f -o #f0 &amp;&amp; #{d.psnup} #f0; \
           fi
     </pre>
        <p>In order to have that rule work correctly, it is expected from the
TeX, or LaTeX file to include something like:

     <pre class="example">          \renewcommand{\printlandscape}{\special{landscape}}
          \printlandscape
     </pre>
        <p class="noindent">in the preamble.

        <p>We don't use a pipe because dvips always outputs data (its prologue)
even if it fails, what prevents error detection.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Library Files</h2>

<p><a name="index-Library-files-182"></a>
To be general and to allow as much customization as possible, a2ps
avoids to hard code its knowledge (encodings, PostScript routines,
etc.), and tries to split it in various files.  Hence it needs a path,
i.e., a list of directories, in which it may find the files it needs.

   <p>The exact value of this library path is available by <span class="samp">a2ps
--list=defaults</span>.  Typically its value is:
<pre class="example">     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     gargantua ~ $ a2ps --list=defaults
     Configuration status of a2ps 4.14
     <em>More stuff deleted here</em>
     Internals:
       verbosity level     = 2
       file command        = /usr/ucb/file -L
       temporary directory =
       library path        =
             /inf/soft/infthes/demaille/.a2ps
             /usr/local/share/a2ps/sheets
             /usr/local/share/a2ps/ps
             /usr/local/share/a2ps/encoding
             /usr/local/share/a2ps/afm

             /usr/local/share/a2ps
     </td></tr></table>
</pre>
   <p>You may change this default path through the configuration files
(see <a href="#Your-Library-Path">Your Library Path</a>).

   <p>If you plan to define yourself some files for a2ps, they should be in
one of those directories.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Documentation Format</h3>

<p>In various places a documentation can be given.  Since some
parts of this document and of web pages are extracted from documentations,
some tags are needed to provide a better layout.  The format is
a mixture made out of Texinfo like commands, but built so that
quick and easy processing can be made.

   <p>These tags are:
     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">code(</span><var>text</var><span class="samp">)code</span><dd>Typeset <var>text</var> like a piece of code.  This should be used
for keys, variables, options etc.  For instance the documentation
of the <code>bold</code> prologue mentions the <code>bw</code> prologue:
     <pre class="example">          Documentation
          This style is meant to replace the old option
          code(-b)code of a2ps 4.3.  It is a copy of the
          black and white prologue, but in which all the
          fonts are in Bold.
          EndDocumentation
     </pre>
     <br><dt><span class="samp">href(</span><var>link</var><span class="samp">)href(</span><var>text</var><span class="samp">)href</span><dd>Specifies a hyper text <var>link</var> displayed as <var>text</var>.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">@example</span><dt><span class="samp">@end example</span><dd>They must be alone on the line.  The text between these tags is
displayed in a code-like fonts.  This should be used for including a
piece of code.  For instance, in the documentation of the <code>gnuc</code>
style sheet:
     <pre class="example">          documentation is
           "Declaration of functions are highlighted"
           "emph(only)emph if you start the function name"
           "in the first column, and it is followed by an"
           "opening parenthesis.  In other words, if you"
           "write"
           "@example"
           "int main (void)"
           "@end example"
           "it won't work.  Write:"
           "@example"
           "int"
           "main (void)"
           "@end example"
          end documentation
     </pre>
     <br><dt><span class="samp">@itemize</span><dt><span class="samp">@item</span> <var>text</var><dt><span class="samp">@end itemize</span><dd>Typeset a list of items. The opening and closing tags must be alone on

<h3 class="section">5.2 Map Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-Map-files-183"></a><a name="index-_002emap-184"></a>Many things are defined through files.  There is a general scheme to
associate an object to the files to use: map files.  They are typically
used to:
     <ul>
<li>resolve aliases.  For instance the ISO-8859-1 encoding is also called
ISO Latin 1, or Latin 1 for short.  The <span class="file">encoding.map</span> file will
map these three names to the same Encoding Description File.

     <li>cope with broken files systems.  For instance,
the-one-you-know-I-don't-need-to-name cannot handle files named
<span class="file">Courier-BoldOblique.afm</span>: it is the same as
<span class="file">Courier-Bold.afm</span>.  The <span class="file">fonts.map</span> file is here to associate
a font file name to a font name. 
</ul>

   <p>The syntax of these files is:
     <ul>
<li>any empty line, or any line starting by a <span class="samp">#</span> is a comment.

     <li>a line with the format
     <pre class="example">          <code>***</code>              <var>path</var>
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">requests that the file designated by <var>path</var> be included at this
point.

     <li>any other line has the format

     <pre class="example">          <var>key</var>               <var>value</var>
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">meaning that when looking for <var>key</var> (e.g., name of a font, an
encoding etc.), a2ps should use <var>value</var> (e.g., font file name,
encoding description file name etc.). 
</ul>

   <p>The map files used in a2ps are:
     <dl>
<dt><span class="file">encoding.map</span><dd>Resolving encodings aliases.

     <br><dt><span class="file">fonts.map</span><dd>Mapping font names to font file names.

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.2 Fonts Description Files</h4>

<p>There are two kinds of data a2ps needs to use a font:
     <ul>
<li><a name="index-_002eafm-185"></a><a name="index-AFM-186"></a>the AFM file (<var>font-key</var><span class="file">.afm</span>), which describes the metrics
information corresponding to <var>font</var>;

     <li><a name="index-_002epfa-187"></a><a name="index-_002epfb-188"></a>in the case <var>font</var> is not known from the printer, the PFA or PFB
file which is down loaded to the printer.  These files are actually the
PostScript programs which execution produces the characters to be drawn
on the page, in this <var>font</var>. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.3 Adding More Font Support</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bmake_005ffonts_005fmap_002esh_007d-189"></a>
a2ps can use as many fonts as you want, provided that you teach it the
name of the files in which are stored the fonts (see <a href="#Fonts-Map-File">Fonts Map File</a>).  To this end, a very primitive but still useful shell script is
provided: <code>make_fonts_map.sh</code>.

   <p>First, you need to find the directories which store the fonts you want
to use, and extend the library path so that a2ps sees those
directories.  For instance, add:
<pre class="example">     AppendLibraryPath: /usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts
</pre>
   <p>Then run <code>make_fonts_map.sh</code>.  It should be located in the
<span class="file">afm/</span> directory of the system's a2ps hierarchy.  Typically
<span class="file">/usr/local/share/a2ps/afm/make_fonts_map.sh</span>.

   <p>This script asks a2ps for the library path, wanders in this path
collecting <code>AFM</code> files, and digging information in them.

   <p>Once the script has finished, a file <span class="file">fonts.map.new</span> was created. 
Check its integrity, and if it's correct, either replace the old
<span class="file">fonts.map</span> with it, or rename <span class="file">fonts.map.new</span> as
<span class="file">fonts.map</span> and place it higher in the the library path (for
instance in your <span class="file">~/.a2ps/</span> directory).

<h3 class="section">5.4 Style Sheet Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-_0040file_007bsheets_002emap_007d-190"></a>
The style sheets are defined in various files.  See see <a href="#Pretty-Printing">Pretty Printing</a> for the structure of these files.  As for most other features,
there is main file, a road map, which defines in which condition a style
sheet should be used (see <a href="#Map-Files">Map Files</a>).  This file is
<span class="file">sheets.map</span>.

   <p>Its format is simple:
<pre class="example">     <var>style-key</var>: <var>patterns</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or
<pre class="example">     include(<var>file</var>)
</pre>
   <p>The <var>patterns</var> need not be on separate lines.  There are two kinds
of patterns:
     <dl>
<dt>/<var>pattern</var>/<var>flags</var><dd>if the current file name matches <var>pattern</var>, then select style
<var>style-key</var> (i.e. file <var>style-key</var><span class="file">.ssh</span>).

     <br><dt>&lt;<var>pattern</var>&gt;<var>flags</var><dd>if the result of a call to <code>file(1)</code> matches <var>pattern</var>, then
select style <var>style-key</var>. 
</dl>

   <p>Currently <var>flags</var> can only be <span class="samp">i</span>, standing for an insentive
match.  Please note that the matching is not truly case insensitive:
rather, a lower case version of the string is compared to the <var>pattern</var>
as is, i.e., the <var>pattern</var> should itself be lower case.

   <p>The special <var>style-key</var> <span class="samp">binary</span> tells a2ps to consider that
the file should not be printed, and will be ignored, unless option
<span class="samp">--print-anyway</span> is given.

   <p>If a style name can't be found, the plain style is used.

   <p>The map file is read bottom up, so that the &ldquo;last&rdquo; match is honored.

   <p>Two things are to retain from this:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>if the file is presented through <code>stdin</code>, then a2ps will run
<code>file(1)</code>.  However, unless you specify a fake file name with
<span class="samp">--stdin</span>, pattern matching upon the name is turn off.  In general
you can expect correct delegations, but almost never pretty printing.

     <li>if <code>file</code> is wrong on some files, a2ps may use bad style sheets. 
In this case, do try option <span class="samp">--guess</span>, compare it with the output
of <code>file</code>, and if the culprit is <code>file</code>, go and complain to
your system administrator :-), or fix it by defining your own filename
pattern matching rules.
        </ol>

   <p>Consider the case of Texinfo files as an example (the language in which
this documentation is written).  Files are usually named
<span class="file">foo.texi</span>, <span class="file">bar.txi</span>, or even <span class="file">baz.texinfo</span>. 
<code>file(1)</code> is able to recognize Texinfo files:

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="example">     doc % file a2ps.texi
     a2ps.texi: Texinfo source text
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

<p class="noindent">Therefore the sheets.map would look like:

<pre class="example">     # Texinfo files
     texinfo:  /*.txi/  /*.texi/  /*.texinfo/
               &lt;Texinfo source*&gt;
</pre>

<h3 class="section">6.1 What is an Encoding</h3>

<p>This section is actually taken from the web pages of
<a href="http://www.alis.com/">Alis Technologies inc.</a>

   <p>Document encoding is the most important but also the most sensitive and
explosive topic in Internet internationalization. It is an essential
factor since most of the information distributed over the Internet is in
text format. But the history of the Internet is such that the
predominant - and in some cases the only possible - encoding is the very
limited ASCII, which can represent only a handful of languages, only
three of which are used to any great extent: English, Indonesian and
Swahili.

   <p>All the other languages, spoken by more than 90% of the world's
population, must fall back on other character sets. And there is a
plethora of them, created over the years to satisfy writing constraints
and constantly changing technological limitations.  The ISO
international character set registry contains only a small fraction;
IBM's character registry is over three centimeters thick; Microsoft and
Apple each have a bunch of their own, as do other software manufacturers
and editors.

   <p>The problem is not that there are too few but rather too many choices,
at least whenever Internet standards allow them. And the surplus is a
real problem; if every Arabic user made his own choice among the three
dozen or so codes available for this language, there is little
likelihood that his "neighbor" would do the same and that they would
thus be able to understand each other. This example is rather extreme,
but it does illustrate the importance of standards in the area of
internationalization. For a group of users sharing the same language to
be able to communicate,

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>the code used in the shared document must always be identified
(labeling)

     <li>they must agree on a small number of codes - only one, if possible
(standards);

     <li>their software must recognize and process all codes (versatility)
        </ol>

   <p>Certain character sets stand out either because of their status as an
official national or international standard, or simply because of their
widespread use.

   <p>First off, there is the ISO 8859 standards series that standardize a
dozen character sets that are useful for a large number of languages
using the Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek and Hebrew alphabets. These
standards have a limited range of application (8 bits per character, a
maximum of 190 characters, no combining) but where they suffice (as they
do for 10 of the 20 most widely used languages), they should be used on
the Internet in preference to other codes. For all other languages,
national standards should preferably be chosen or, if none are
available, a well-known and widely-used code should be the second
choice.

   <p>Even when we limit ourselves to the most widely used standards, the
overabundance remains considerable, and this significantly complicates
life for truly international software developers and users of several
languages, especially when such languages can only be represented by a
single code. It was to resolve this problem that both Unicode and the
ISO 10646 International standard were created. Two standards? Oh no! 
Their designers soon realized the problem and were able to cooperate to
the extent of making the character set <dfn>repertoires</dfn> and coding
identical.

   <p>ISO 10646 (and Unicode) contain over 30,000 characters capable of
representing most of the living languages within a single code. All of
these characters, except for the <em>Han</em> (Chinese characters also
used in Japanese and Korean), have a name.  And there is still room to
encode the missing languages as soon as enough of the necessary research
is done.  Unicode can be used to represent several languages, using
different alphabets, within the same electronic document.

        <p>The Cyrillic alphabet was created by St. Cyril in the 9th century from
the upper case letters of the Greek alphabet. The more ancient
Glagolithic (from the ancient Slav glagol, which means "word"), was
created for certain dialects from the lower case Greek letters. These
characters are still used by Dalmatian Catholics in their liturgical
books. The kings of France were sworn in at Reims using a Gospel in
Glagolithic characters attributed to St. Jerome.

        <p>Note that Russians seem to prefer the KOI8-R character set to the ISO

<h2 class="chapter">7 Pretty Printing</h2>

<p><a name="index-Pretty-printing-211"></a><a name="index-Symbol-conversion-212"></a>The main feature of a2ps is its pretty-printing capabilities. 
Two different levels of pretty printing can be reached:
     <ul>
<li>basic (normal highlight level) in which what you print is what you
wrote.

     <li>string (heavy highlight level), in which in general, some keywords are
replaced by a Symbol character which best represents them.  For
instance, in most languages <span class="samp">&lt;=</span> and <span class="samp">&gt;=</span> will be replaced by
the corresponding single character from the font Symbol. 
</ul>

   <p>Note that the difference is up to the author of the style sheet.

<blockquote><p>Claire is a high-level functional and object-oriented language with
advanced rule processing capabilities. It is intended to allow the
programmer to express complex algorithms with fewer lines and in an
elegant and readable manner.

        <p>To provide a high degree of expressivity, Claire uses:
          <ul>
<li> A very rich type system including type intervals and second-order
 types (with dual static/dynamic typing),
<li> Parametric classes and methods,
<li> An object-oriented logic with set extensions,
<li> Dynamic versioning that supports easy exploration of search spaces. 
</ul>
        To achieve its goal of readability, Claire uses
          <ul>
<li> set-based programming with an intuitive syntax,
<li> simple-minded object-oriented programming,
<li> truly polymorphic and parametric functional programming,
<li> a powerful-yet-readable extension of DATALOG to express logical conditions,
<li> an entity-relation approach with explicit relations, inverses,
 unknown values and relational
<li> operations.

<h4 class="subsection">7.3.1 Symbol</h4>

<p>The style sheet <code>Symbol</code> introduces easy to type keywords to obtain
the special characters of the PostScript font <code>Symbol</code>.  The
keywords are named to provide a LaTeX taste.  These keywords are also
the names used when designing a style sheet, hence to get the full list,
see <a href="#A-Bit-of-Syntax">A Bit of Syntax</a>.

   <p>If you want to know the correspondence, it is suggested to print the
style sheet file of <code>Symbol</code>:
<pre class="example">     a2ps -g symbol.ssh

<h4 class="subsection">7.3.2 PreScript</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bPreScript_007d-325"></a>
<code>PreScript</code> has been designed in conjunction with a2ps.  Since
bold sequences, special characters etc. were implemented in a2ps, we
thought it would be good to allow direct access to those features:
<code>PreScript</code> became an input language for a2ps, where special
font treatments are specified in an <code>ssh</code> syntax (see <a href="#Style-Sheets-Implementation">Style Sheets Implementation</a>).

   <p>The main advantages for using <code>PreScript</code> are:
     <ul>
<li>it is fairly simple,

     <li>a2ps is small and easy to install, hence it is available on
every UNIX platform. 
</ul>

   <p>It can be a good candidate for generation of PostScript output
(syntactic pretty-printers, generation of various reports etc.).

<p>Every command name begins with a backslash (<span class="samp">\</span>). If the command
uses an argument, it is given between curly braces with no spaces
between the command name and the argument.

   <p>The main limit on <code>PreScript</code> is that no command can be used inside
another command. For instance the following line will be badly
interpreted by a2ps:

<pre class="example">     \Keyword{Problems using \keyword{recursive \copyright} calls}
</pre>
   <p>The correct way to write this in <code>PreScript</code> is

<pre class="example">     \Keyword{Problems using} \keyword{recursive} \copyright \Keyword{calls}.
</pre>
   <p>Everything from an unquoted % to the end of line is ignored

<h5 class="subsubsection">7.3.3.1 Special characters</h5>

<p><span class="samp">$</span> is ignored in <code>PreTeX</code> for compatibility with LaTeX,
and <span class="samp">%</span> introduces a comment. Hence they are the only symbols which
have to be quoted by a <span class="samp">\</span>.  The following characters should also be
quoted to produce good LaTeX files, but are accepted by
<code>PreScript</code>: <span class="samp">_</span>, <span class="samp">&amp;</span>, <span class="samp">#</span>.

   <p>Note that <em>inside a command</em>, like <code>\textbf</code>, the quotation
mechanism does not work in <code>PreScript</code> (<code>\textrm{#$%}</code>
writes <span class="samp">#$%</span>) though LaTeX still requires quotation. Hence whenever
special characters or symbols are introduced, they should be at the
outer most level.

   <p>LaTeX is more demanding about special symbols. Most of them must be
in so-called math mode, which means that the command must be inside
<span class="samp">$</span> signs. For instance, though
<pre class="example">     If \forall x \in E, x \in F then E \subseteq F.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is perfectly legal in PreTeX, it should be written
<pre class="example">     If $\forall x \in E, x \in F$ then $E \subseteq F$.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">for LaTeX. Since in PreTeX every <span class="samp">$</span> is discarded (unless
quoted by a <span class="samp">\</span>), the second form is also admitted.

<h4 class="subsection">7.3.4 TeXScript</h4>

<p><code>TeXScript</code> is a replacement of the old version of
<code>PreScript</code>: it combines both the a2ps-like and the
LaTeX-like syntaxes through inheritance of both <code>PreScript</code> and
<code>PreTeX</code>.

   <p>In addition it provides commands meant to ease processing of file for
a2ps by LaTeX.

   <p>Everything between <span class="samp">%%TeXScript:skip</span> and <span class="samp">%%TeXScript:piks</span>
will be ignored in <code>TeXScript</code>, so that there can be inserted
command definitions for LaTeX exclusively.

   <p>The commands <span class="samp">\textbi</span> (for bold-italic) and <span class="samp">\textsy</span> (for
symbol) do not exist in LaTeX.  They should be defined in the
preamble:

<pre class="example">     %%TeXScript:skip
     \newcommand{\textbi}[1]{\textbf{\textit{#1}}}
     \newcommand{\textsy}[1]{#1}
     %%TeXScript:piks
</pre>
   <p>There is no way in TeXScript to get an automatic numbering.  There is
no equivalent to the LaTeX environment <code>enumerate</code>.  But every
command beginning by <code>\text</code> is doubled by a command beginning by
<span class="samp">\magic</span>.  a2ps behaves the same way on both families of commands. 
Hence, if one specifies that arguments of those functions should be
ignored in the preamble of the LaTeX document, the numbering is
emulated.  For instance
<pre class="example">     \begin{enumerate}
     \magicbf{1.}\item First line
     \magicbf{2.}\item Second line
     \end{enumerate}
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will be treated the same way both in TeXScript and LaTeX.

   <p><span class="samp">\header</span> and <span class="samp">\footer</span>, are not understood by LaTeX.

<h3 class="section">7.4 Faces</h3>

<p><a name="index-Face-326"></a>A <dfn>face</dfn> is an attribute given to a piece of text, which specifies
how it should look like.  Since a2ps is devoted to pretty-printing
source files, the faces it uses are related to the syntactic entities
that can be encountered in a file.

   <p>The faces a2ps uses are:
     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">Plain</span><dd>This corresponds to the text body.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">Keyword</span><dt><span class="samp">Keyword_strong</span><dd>These are related to the keywords that may appear in a text.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">Comment</span><dt><span class="samp">Comment_strong</span><dd>These are related to comments in the text.  Remember that comments
should be considered as non essential ("<em>Aaaeaaarg</em>" says the
programmer); indeed, the user might suppress the comments thanks (?) to
the option <span class="samp">--strip-level</span>.  Hence, <strong>never</strong> use these faces
just because you think they look better on, say, strings.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">Label</span><dt><span class="samp">Label_strong</span><dd>These are used when a point of extreme importance, or a sectioning
point, is met.  Typically, functions declarations etc.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">String</span><dd>Used mainly for string and character literals.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">Error</span><dd>Used to underline the presence of an error.  For instance in
Encapsulated PostScript, some PostScript operators are forbidden: they
are underlined as errors. 
</dl>

   <p>Actually, there is also the face <span class="samp">Symbol</span>, but this one is
particular: it is not legal changing its font.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.1 Name and key</h4>

<p><a name="index-key-328"></a><a name="index-_0040file_007bsheets_002emap_007d-329"></a>Every style sheet has both a key, and a name.  The name can be clean and
beautiful, with any character you might want.  The key is in fact the
prefix part of the file name, and is alpha-numerical, lower case, and
less than 8 characters long.

   <p>Anywhere a2ps needs to recognize a style sheet by a name, <strong>it
uses the key</strong> (in the <span class="file">sheets.map</span> file, with the option <span class="samp">-E</span>,
etc.).

   <p>As an example, C++ is implemented in a file called <span class="file">cxx.ssh</span>, in
which the name is declared to be <span class="samp">C++</span>.

   <p>The rationale is that not every system accepts any character in the file
name (e.g., no <span class="samp">+</span> in MS-DOS).  Moreover, it allows to make
symbolic links on the ssh files (e.g., <span class="samp">ln -s cxx.ssh c++.ssh</span>
let's you use <span class="samp">-E c++</span>).

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.2 Comments</h4>

<p>ssh files can include the name of its author, a version number, a
documentation note and a requirement on the version of a2ps.  For
instance, if a style sheet requires a2ps version 4.9.6, then a2ps
version 4.9.5 will reject it.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.3 Alphabets</h4>

<p><a name="index-Alphabets-330"></a><a name="index-Separator-331"></a>a2ps needs to know the beginning and the end of a word,
especially keywords.  Hence it needs two alphabets: the first one
specifying by which letters an identifier can begin, and the second one
for the rest of the word.  If you prefer, a keyword starts with a
character belonging to the first alphabet, and a character not
pertaining to the second is a separator.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.4 Case sensitivity</h4>

<p>If the style is case insensitive, then matching is case insensitive
(keywords, operators and sequences).

<p><a name="index-Keyword-332"></a><a name="index-Rule-333"></a><a name="index-P_002dRule-334"></a><a name="index-Operator-335"></a>
A <dfn>P-rule</dfn> (Pretty printing rule), or <dfn>rule</dfn> for short, is a
structure which consists of two items:
     <dl>
<dt><dfn>lhs</dfn><dd><a name="index-lhs-336"></a><dt><dfn>left-hand side</dfn><dd>its source string, with which the source file is compared;

     <br><dt><dfn>rhs</dfn><dd><a name="index-rhs-337"></a><dt><dfn>right hand side</dfn><dd>a list of faced strings which will replace the text matched in the
pretty-printed output.  A faced string is composed of
          <ul>
<li>a string, or a reference to a part of the source string
(see <a href="regex.html#Back_002dreference-Operator">Back-reference Operator (Regex manual)</a>)

          <li>the face to use to print it
</ul>
     </dl>

   <p>Just a short example: <span class="samp">(foo, bar, Keyword_strong)</span> as a rule
means that every input occurrence of <span class="samp">foo</span> will be replaced by
<span class="samp">bar</span>, written with the <code>Keyword_strong</code> face.

   <p>If the destination string is empty, then a2ps will use the source
string.  This is different from giving the source string as a
destination string if the case is different.  An example will make it
fairly clear.

   <p>Let <code>foobar</code> be a case insensitive style sheet including the
rules <span class="samp">(foo, "", Keyword)</span> and <span class="samp">(bar, bar, Keyword)</span>.  Then,
on the input <span class="samp">FOO BAR</span>, a2ps will produce <span class="samp">FOO bar</span> in
<code>Keyword</code>.

   <p>a2ps implements two different ways to match a string.  The difference
comes from that some keywords are sensitive to the delimiters around
them (such as <span class="samp">unsigned</span> and <span class="samp">int</span> in <code>C</code>, which are
definitely not the same thing as <span class="samp">unsignedint</span>), and others not (in
<code>C</code>, <span class="samp">!=</span> is "different from" both in <span class="samp">a != b</span> and
<span class="samp">a!=b</span>).

   <p>The first ones are called <dfn>keywords</dfn> in a2ps jargon, and the
seconds are <dfn>operators</dfn>.  Operators are matched anywhere they
appear, while keywords need to have separators around them
(see <a href="#Alphabets">Alphabets</a>).

   <p>Let us give a more complicated example: that of the <code>Yacc</code> rules. 
A rule in <code>Yacc</code> is of the form:
<pre class="example">     a_rule : part1 part2 ;
</pre>
   <p>Suppose you want to highlight these rules.  To recognize them, you will
write a regular expression specifying that:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>it must start at the beginning of the line,

     <li>then there is string composed of symbols, which is what you want to
highlight,

     <li>and a colon, which can be preceded by blank characters.
        </ol>

   <p>The regexp you want is: <span class="samp">/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[\t ]*:/</span>.  But with the
rule
<pre class="example">     /^[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[\t ]*:/, "", Label_strong
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the blanks and the colon are highlighted too.  Hence you need to
specify some parts in the regexp (see <a href="regex.html#Back_002dreference-Operator">Back-reference Operator (Regex manual)</a>), and use a longer
list of destination strings.  The correct rule is
<pre class="example">     (/^([a-zA-Z0-9_]*)([\t ]*:)/, \1 Label_strong, \2 Plain)
</pre>
   <p>Since it is a bit painful to read, regexps can be spread upon several
lines.  It is strongly suggested to break them by groups, and to
document the group:
<pre class="example">     (/^([a-zA-Z0-9_]*)/    # \1. Name of the rule
      /([\t ]*:)/           # \2. Trailing space and colon
      \1 Label_strong, \2 Plain)
</pre>

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.6 Sequences</h4>

<p><a name="index-Sequences-338"></a><a name="index-Markers-339"></a>A <dfn>sequence</dfn> is a string between two <dfn>markers</dfn>, along with a
list of exceptions.  A marker is a fixed string.  Typical examples are
comments, string (with usually <span class="samp">"</span> as opening and closing markers,
and <span class="samp">\\</span> and <span class="samp">\"</span> as exceptions) etc.  Three faces are used:
one for the initial marker, one for the core of the sequence, and a last
one for the final maker.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.7 Optional entries</h4>

<p><a name="index-Optional-entries-340"></a>There are two levels of pretty-printing encoded in the style sheets.  By
default, a2ps uses the first level, called <dfn>normal</dfn>, unless the
option <span class="samp">-g</span> is specified, in which case, <dfn>heavy</dfn> highlighting
is invoked, i.e., optional keywords, operators and sequences are
considered.

     It is a good idea to print the style sheet <span class="samp">symbols.ssh</span> to see
them:
     <pre class="example">          a2ps symbols.ssh
     </pre>
     <li>a string starts and finishes with <span class="samp">"</span>, and may contain anything. 
Regular <code>C</code> escaping mechanism is used.

     <li>a regular expression starts and finishes with <span class="samp">/</span>, and may contain
anything.  Regular <code>C</code> escaping mechanism is used.  Regexps can be
split in several parts, <i>a` la</i> C strings (i.e., <span class="samp">/part 1/ /part
2/</span>).

     <li>any sequence of regular characters which is not a keyword, is a string
(consider this as a shortcut, avoiding extraneous <span class="samp">"</span>).

<p>There are two things a2ps needs to know: what is symbol consistent,
and whether the style is case insensitive.

     <dl>
<dt><code>alphabet</code><dd>To define two different alphabets, use
     <pre class="example">          first alphabet is <var>string</var>

<h4 class="subsection">7.6.4 Inheriting from Other Style Sheets</h4>

<p>It is possible to extend an existing style. The syntax is:
<pre class="example">     ancestors are
        <var>ancestor_1</var>[, <var>ancestor_2</var>...]
     end ancestors
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>ancestor1</var> etc. are style sheet keys.

   <p>For semantics, the rules are the following:
     <ul>
<li>the ancestors are read in order;

     <li>the definition of the current style is read last;

     <li>it is always the last item read which wins (last defined alphabets, case
sensitivity, keywords, operators and sequences).

   </ul>

   <p>As an example, both <code>C++</code> and <code>Objective C</code> style sheets
extend the <code>C</code> style sheet:

<pre class="example">     style "Objective C" is
     #<i>[...]</i>
     ancestors are
        c
     end ancestors
     #<i>[...]</i>
     end style

   <p>To the biggest surprise of the author, mutually dependent style sheets
do work!

<h4 class="subsection">7.6.5 Syntax for the P-Rules</h4>

<p>See <a href="#P_002dRules">P-Rules</a>, for the definition of <dfn>P-rule</dfn>.

   <p>Because of various short cuts, there are many ways to declare a rule:
<pre class="example">     <var>rules</var>     ::= <var>rule_1</var> <span class="samp">,</span> <var>rule_2</var>...
     <var>rule</var>      ::= <span class="samp">(</span> <var>lhs</var> <var>rhs</var> <span class="samp">)</span>
                | <var>lhs</var> <var>srhs</var> ;
     <var>lhs</var>       ::= <var>string</var> | <var>regex</var> ;
     <var>rhs</var>       ::= <var>srhs</var> <span class="samp">,</span> ...
     <var>srhs</var>      ::= <var>latex-keyword</var> | <var>expansion</var> <var>face</var>
     <var>expansion</var> ::= <var>string</var> | <span class="samp">\</span><var>num</var> | &lt;nothing&gt;;
     <var>face</var>      ::= <var>face-keyword</var> | &lt;nothing&gt;;
</pre>
   <p>The rules are the following:
     <ul>
<li><a name="index-Regular-expression-341"></a>If the left-hand side (lhs) is a regular expression, then it is compiled
with the following syntax bits:
     <pre class="example">          #define RE_SYNTAX_A2PS \
            (/* Allow char classes. */					\
              RE_CHAR_CLASSES						\
            /* Be picky. */						\
            | RE_CONTEXT_INVALID_OPS					\
            /* Allow intervals with `{' and `}', forbid invalid ranges. */\
            | RE_INTERVALS | RE_NO_BK_BRACES | RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES		\
            /* `(' and `)' are the grouping operators. */			\
            | RE_NO_BK_PARENS						\
            /* `|' is the alternation. */					\
            | RE_NO_BK_VBAR)
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Basically it means that all of the possible operators are used, and that
they are in non-backslashed form.  For instance <span class="samp">(</span> and <span class="samp">)</span>
stand for the group operator, while <span class="samp">\\(</span> stands for the character
<span class="samp">(</span>.  See <a href="regex.html#Regular-Expression-Syntax">Regular Expression Syntax (Regex manual)</a>, for a detailed description of the regular
expressions.

     <li>If no <var>expansion</var> is specified, then the matched string is used. 
For instance <span class="samp">(/fo*/, NULL, Keyword)</span> applied on the source
<span class="samp">fooooo</span> produces <span class="samp">fooooo</span> in <code>Keyword</code>.

     <li>If no <var>face</var> is given, then
          <ul>
<li>if the context defines the default face, then this face is used;

          <li>if no default face is given, <code>PLAIN</code> is used. 
</ul>
     </ul>

<h4 class="subsection">7.6.6 Declaring the keywords and the operators</h4>

<p>Basically, keywords and operators are lists of rules.  The syntax is:
<pre class="example">     keywords are
       <var>rules</var>
     end keywords
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or
<pre class="example">     keywords in <var>face-keyword</var> are
       <var>rules</var>
     end keywords
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in which case the default face is set to <var>face-keyword</var>.

   <p>As an example:
<pre class="example">     keywords in Keyword_strong are
       /foo*/,
       "bar" "BAR" Keyword,
       -&gt; \rightarrow
     end keywords
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is valid.

   <p>The syntax for the operators is the same, and both constructs can be
qualified with an <code>optional</code> flag, in which case they are taken
into account in the heavy highlighting mode (see <a href="#Pretty-Print-Options">Pretty Print Options</a>).

   <p>This is an extract of the <code>C</code> style sheet:
<pre class="example">     optional operators are
        -&gt; \rightarrow,
        &amp;&amp; \wedge,
        || \vee,
        != \neq,
        == \equiv,
        # We need to protect these, so that &lt;= is not replaced in &lt;&lt;=
        &lt;&lt;=,
        &gt;&gt;=,
        &lt;= \leq,
        &gt;= \geq,
        ! \not
     end operators
</pre>
   <p>Note how <span class="samp">&lt;&lt;=</span> and <span class="samp">&gt;&gt;=</span> are protected (there are defined to
be written as is when met in the source).  This is to prevent the two
last characters of <span class="samp">&lt;&lt;=</span> from being converted into a `less or
equal' sign.

   <p>The order in which you define the elements of a category (but the
sequences) does not matter.  But since a2ps sorts them at run time, it
may save time if the alphabetical <code>C</code>-order is more or less
followed.

   <p>You should be aware that when declaring a keyword with a regular
expression as lhs, then a2ps automatically makes this expression
matching only if there are no character of the first alphabet both just
before, and just after the string.

   <p>In term of implementation, it means that
<pre class="example">     keywords are
       /foo|bar/
     end keywords
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is exactly the same as
<pre class="example">     operators are
       /\\b(foo|bar)\\b/
     end operators
</pre>
   <p>This can cause problems if you use anchors (e.g. <code>$</code>, or <code>^</code>)
in keywords: the matcher will be broken.  In this particular case,
define your keywords as operators, taking care of the <span class="samp">\\b</span> by
yourself.

   <p>See <a href="regex.html#Match_002dword_002dboundary-Operator">Match-word-boundary Operator (Regex manual)</a>, for details on <span class="samp">\b</span>.

<h4 class="subsection">7.6.7 Declaring the sequences</h4>

<p>Sequences admit several declarations too:
<pre class="example">     <var>sequences</var>      ::= sequences are
                          <var>sequence_1</var> <span class="samp">,</span> <var>sequence_2</var>...
                        end sequences
     <var>sequence</var>       ::= <var>rule</var> <var>in_face</var> <var>close_opt</var> <var>exceptions_opt</var>
                      | <code>C-string</code>
                      | <code>C-char</code>
                      ;
     <var>close_opt</var>      ::= <var>rule</var>
                      | closers are
                          <var>rules</var>
                        end closers
                      | &lt;nothing&gt;
                      ;
     <var>exceptions_opt</var> ::= exceptions are
                          <var>rules</var>
                        end exceptions
                      | &lt;nothing&gt;
                      ;
</pre>
   <p>The rules are:
     <ul>
<li>The default face is then <var>in_face</var>.

     <li>If no closing rule is given, <span class="samp">"\n"</span> (i.e., end-of-line) is used. 
</ul>

   <p>As a first example, here is the correct definition for a <code>C</code> string:
<pre class="example">     sequences are
      "\"" Plain String "\"" Plain
          exceptions are
             "\\\\", "\\\""
          end exceptions
     end sequences
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bC_002dstring_007d-342"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bC_002dchar_007d-343"></a>Since a great deal of languages uses this kind of constructs, you may
use <code>C-string</code> to mean exactly this, and <code>C-char</code> for
manifest characters defined the <code>C</code> way.

   <p>The following example comes from <span class="file">ssh.ssh</span>, the style sheet for
style sheet files, in which there are two kinds of pseudo-strings: the
strings (<span class="samp">"example"</span>), and the regular expressions
(<span class="samp">/example/</span>).  We do not want the content of the pseudo-strings in
the face <code>String</code>.

<pre class="example">     sequences are
       # The comments
       "#" Comment,
     
       # The name of the style sheet
       "style " Keyword_strong (Label + Index1) " is" Keyword_strong,
     
       # Strings are exactly the C-strings, though we don't want to
       # have them in the "string" face
       "\"" Plain "\""
          exceptions are
             "\\\\", "\\\""
          end exceptions,
     
       # Regexps
       "/" Plain "/"
          exceptions are
             "\\\\", "\\\/"
          end exceptions
     
     end sequences
</pre>
   <p>The order between sequences does matter.  For instance in Java,
<span class="samp">/**</span> introduces strong comments, and <span class="samp">/*</span> comments. 
<span class="samp">/**</span> <em>must</em> be declared before <span class="samp">/*</span>, or it will be
hidden.

   <p>There are actually some sequences that could have been implemented as
operators with a specific regular expression (that goes up to the
closer).  Nevertheless be aware of a big difference: regular expression
are applied to a single line of the source file, hence, they cannot
match on several lines.  For instance, the <code>C</code> comments,
<pre class="example">     /*
      * a comment
      */
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">cannot be implemented with operators, though <code>C++</code> comments can:
<pre class="example">     //
     // a comment
     //
</pre>

<h4 class="subsection">7.6.8 Checking a Style Sheet</h4>

<p>Once your style sheet is written, you may want to let a2ps perform
simple tests on it (e.g., checking there are no rules involving upper
case characters in a case insensitive style sheet, etc.).  These tests
are performed when verbosity includes the style sheets.

   <p>you may also want to use the special convention that when a style sheet
is required with a suffix, then a2ps will not look at it in its library
path, but precisely from when you are.

   <p>Suppose for instance you extended the <span class="file">c.ssh</span> style sheet, which is
in the current directory, and is said case insensitive.  Run
<pre class="example">     ubu $ a2ps foo.c -Ec.ssh -P void -v sheets
     <i># Long output deleted</i>
     Checking coherence of "C" (c.ssh)
     a2ps: c.ssh:`FILE' uses upper case characters
     a2ps: c.ssh:`NULL' uses upper case characters
     "C" (c.ssh) is corrupted.
     ---------- End of Finalization of c.ssh
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, it is clear that <code>C</code> is not case insensitive.

<p>First of all, here is a sample of a <span class="file">ChangeLog</span> file, taken from
the <span class="file">misc/</span> directory of the original a2ps package:
<pre class="example">     Sun Apr 27 14:29:22 1997  Akim Demaille  &lt;demaille@inf.enst.fr&gt;
     
             * base.ps: Merged in color.ps, since now a lot is

             * base.ps: Got rid of CourierBack and reencoded_backspace_font.
               Now the C has to handle this by itself.

             * *.enc: they build their own dictionaries, to ease multi
               lingual documents.
</pre>
   <p>The syntax is really simple: A line specifying the author and the date
of the changes, then a list of changes, all of them starting with an
star followed by the name of the files concerned, then optionally
between parentheses the functions affected, and then some comments.

<h4 class="subsection">7.7.2 Implementation</h4>

<p>Quite naturally the style will be called <code>ChangeLog</code>, hence:
<pre class="example">     style ChangeLog is
     written by "Akim Demaille &lt;demaille@inf.enst.fr&gt;"
     version is 1.0
     requires a2ps 4.9.5
     
     documentation is
        "This is a tutorial style sheet.\n"
     end documentation
       ...
     end style
</pre>
   <p>A first interesting and easy entry is that of function names, between
<span class="samp">(</span> and <span class="samp">)</span>:
<pre class="example">     sequences are
       "(" Plain Label ")" Plain
     end sequences
</pre>
   <p>A small problem that may occur is that there can be several functions
mentioned separated by commas, that we don't want to highlight this way. 
Commas, here, are exceptions.  Since regular expressions are not yet
implemented in a2ps, there is a simple but stupid way to avoid that
white spaces are all considered as part of a function name, namely
defining two exceptions: one which captures a single comma, and a
second, capturing a comma and its trailing space.

   <p>For the file names, the problem is a bit more delicate, since they may
end with <span class="samp">:</span>, or when starts the list of functions.  Then, we
define two sequences, each one with one of the possible closers, the
exceptions being attached to the first one:

<pre class="example">     sequences are
       "* " Plain Label_strong ":" Plain
          exceptions are
             ", " Plain, "," Plain
          end exceptions,
       "* " Plain Label_strong " " Plain
     end sequences
</pre>
   <p>Finally, let us say that some words have a higher importance in the core
of text: those about removing or adding something.
<pre class="example">     keywords in Keyword_strong are
       add, added, remove, removed
     end keywords
</pre>
   <p>Since they may appear in lower or upper, of mixed case, the style will
be defined as case insensitive.

   <p>Finally, we end up with this style sheet file, in which an optional
highlighting of the mail address of the author is done.  Saving the file
is last step.  But do not forget that a style sheet has both a name as
nice as you may want (such as <span class="samp">Common Lisp</span>), and a key on which
there are strict rules: the prefix must be alpha-numerical, lower case,
with no more than 8 characters.  Let's chose <span class="file">chlog.ssh</span>.

<pre class="example">     # This is a tutorial on a2ps' style sheets
     style ChangeLog is
     written by "Akim Demaille &lt;demaille@inf.enst.fr&gt;"
     version is 1.0
     requires a2ps 4.9.5
     
     documentation is
        "Second level of high lighting covers emails."
     end documentation
     
     sequences are
       "(" Plain Label ")" Plain
          exceptions are
             ", " Plain, "," Plain
          end exceptions,
       "* " Plain Label_strong ":" Plain
          exceptions are
             ", " Plain, "," Plain
          end exceptions,
       "* " Plain Label_strong " " Plain
     end sequences
     
     keywords in Keyword_strong are
       add, added, remove, removed
     end keywords
     
     optional sequences are
        &lt; Plain Keyword &gt; Plain
     end sequences
     end style
</pre>
   <p>As a last step, you may which to let a2ps check your style sheet, both
its syntax, and common errors:
<pre class="example">     ubu $ a2ps -vsheet -E/tmp/chlog.ssh ChangeLog -P void
     <i>Long output deleted</i>
     Checking coherence of "ChangeLog" (/tmp/chlog.ssh)
     "ChangeLog" (/tmp/chlog.ssh) is sane.
     ---------- End of Finalization of /tmp/chlog.ssh
</pre>
   <p>It's all set, your style sheet is ready!

<h4 class="subsection">7.7.3 The Entry in <span class="file">sheets.map</span></h4>

<p>The last touch is to include the pattern rules about <span class="file">ChangeLog</span>
files (which could appear as <span class="file">ChangeLog.old</span> etc.) in
<span class="file">sheets.map</span>:
<pre class="example">     # ChangeLog files
     chlog:  /ChangeLog*/
</pre>
   <p>This won't work...  Well, not always.  Not for instance if you print
<span class="file">misc/ChangeLog</span>.  This is not a bug, but truly a feature, since
sometimes one gets more information about the type of a file from its
path, than from the file name.

   <p>Here, to match the preceding path that may appear, just use <span class="samp">*</span>:
<pre class="example">     # ChangeLog files
     chlog:  /*ChangeLog*/
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you want to be more specific (<span class="file">FooChangeLog</span> should not
match), use:
<pre class="example">     # ChangeLog files
     chlog:  /ChangeLog*/ /*\/ChangeLog*/

<h4 class="subsection">7.7.4 More Sophisticated Rules</h4>

<p>The example we have presented until now uses only basic features, and
does not take advantage of the regexp.  In this section we should how
to write more evolved pretty printing rules.

   <p>The target will be the lines like:
<pre class="example">     Sun Apr 27 14:29:22 1997  Akim Demaille  &lt;demaille@inf.enst.fr&gt;
     
     Fri Apr 25 14:05:20 1997  Akim Demaille  &lt;demaille@inf.enst.fr&gt;
</pre>
   <p>There are three fields: the date, the name, the mail.  These lines all
start at the beginning of line.  The last field is the easier to
recognize: is starts with a <span class="samp">&lt;</span>, and finishes with a <span class="samp">&gt;</span>.  Its
rule is then <span class="samp">/&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;/</span>.  It is now easier to specify the second:
it is composed only of words, at least one, separated by blanks, and is
followed by the mail: <span class="samp">/[[:alpha:]]+([ \t]+[[:alpha:]]+)*/</span>. 
To concatenate the two, we introduce optional blanks, and we put each one
into a pair of <span class="samp">(</span>-<span class="samp">)</span> to make each one a recognizable
part:
<pre class="example">     ([[:alpha:]]+([ \t]+[[:alpha:]]+)*)
     (.+)
     (&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;)
</pre>
   <p>Now the first part is rather easy: it starts at the beginning of the
line, finishes with a digit.  Once again, it is separated from the
following field by blanks. Split by groups (see <a href="regex.html#Grouping-Operators">Grouping Operators (Regex manual)</a>), we have:
<pre class="example">     ^
     ([^\t ].*[0-9])
     ([ \t]+)
     ([[:alpha:]]+([ \t]+[[:alpha:]]+)*)
     (.+)
     (&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;)
</pre>
   <p>Now the destination is composed of back references to those groups,
together with a face:
<pre class="example">     # We want to highlight the date and the maintainer name
     optional operators are
       (/^([^\t ].*[0-9])/                        # \1. The date
        /([ \t]+)/                                # \2. Spaces
        /([[:alpha:]]+([ \t]+[[:alpha:]]+)*)/     # \3. Name
        /(.+)/                                    # \5. space and &lt;
        /(&lt;[^&gt;]+)&gt;/                               # \6. email
        \1 Keyword, \2 Plain, \3 Keyword_strong,
        \5 Plain, \6 Keyword, &gt; Plain)
     end operators
</pre>
   <p>Notice the way regexps are split, to ease reading.

<p>This section is meant for people who wish to contribute style sheets. 
There is a couple of additional constraints, explained here.

     <dl>
<dt><em>The Copyright</em><dd>Please, do put a copyright in your file, the same as all other
distributed files have: it should include your name, but also the three
paragraphs stating the sheet is covered by the GPL.  I won't distribute
files without these paragraphs.

     <br><dt><em>The Version</em><dd>Do put a version number, so that people can track evolutions.

     <br><dt><em>The Requirements</em><dd>Make sure to include a requirement on the needed version of a2ps.  If
you don't know what to put, just put the version of the a2ps you run.

     <br><dt><em>The Documentation</em><dd>The documentation string is mandatory.  Unless the language your style
sheet covers is widely known, please document a bit what the style sheet
is meant for.  If there were choices you made, if there are special
behaviors, document them.

     <br><dt><em>The </em><span class="file">sheets.map</span><em> Entries</em><dd>Put in a comment on the <span class="file">sheets.map</span> lines that correspond to your
style sheet.

     <br><dt><em>A Test File</em><dd>It is better to give a test file, as small as possible, that contains
the most specific and/or most difficult contructs that your style sheet
supports.  I need to be able to distribute this file, therefore, do not
put anything that is copyrighted.

<h3 class="section">8.1 Foreword: Good and Bad PostScript</h3>

<p><a name="index-Optimize-for-Speed-344"></a><a name="index-Optimize-for-Portability-345"></a><a name="index-PostScript-Quality-346"></a><a name="index-DSC-347"></a>
To read this section, the reader must understand what DSC are
(see <a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a>).

   <blockquote>
<i>Why are there good PostScript files, easy to post-process, and bad
files that none of my tools seem to understand?  They print fine
though!</i>
</blockquote>

   <p>Once you understood that PostScript is not a page description format
(like PDF is), you'll have understood most of the problem.  Let's
imagine for a second that you are a word processor.

   <p>The user asks you to print his/her 100 page document in PostScript.  Up
to page 50, there are few different fonts used.  Then, on pages 51 to
80, there are now many different heavy fonts.

   <p>When/where will you download the fonts?

   <p>The most typical choice, sometimes called <dfn>Optimize for Speed</dfn>, is,
once you arrived to page 51, to download those fonts <strong>once</strong> for
the rest of the document.  The global processing chain will have worked
quite quickly: little effort from the software, same from the printer;
better yet: you can start sending the file to the printer even before it
is finished!  The problem is that this is not DSC conformant, and it is
easy to understand why: if somebody wants to print only the page 60,
then s/he will lack the three fonts which were defined in page 51... 
This document is not page independent.

   <p>Another choice is to download the three fonts in <strong>each</strong> page
ranging from 51 to 80, that is the PostScript file contains 30 times the
definition of each font.  It is easy for the application to do that, but
the file is getting real big, and the printer will have to interpret 30
times the same definitions of fonts.  But it is DSC conformant!  And you
can still send the file while you make it.

   <p>Now you understand why
<blockquote>
<strong>Non DSC conformant files are not necessarily badly designed
files from broken applications.</strong>
</blockquote>

   <p>They are files meant to be sent directly to the printer (they are still
perfect PostScript files after all!), they are not meant to be
post-processed.  And the example clearly shows why they are
<strong>right</strong>.

   <p>There is a third possibility, sometimes called <dfn>Optimize for
Portability</dfn>: downloading the three fonts in the prologue of the
document, i.e., the section before the first page where are given all
the common definitions of the whole file.  This is a bit more
complicated to implement (the prologue, which is issued first though,
grows at the same time as you process the file), and cannot be sent
concurrently with the processing (you have to process the whole file to
design the prologue).  This file is small (the fonts are downloaded once
only), and DSC conformant.  Well, there are problems, of course...  You
need to wait before sending the output, it can be costly for the
computer (which cannot transfer as it produces), and for the printer
(you've burnt quite a lot of RAM right since the beginning just to hold
fonts that won't be used before page 51...  This can be a real problem
for small printers).

   <p>This is what a2ps does.

   <p>If should be clear that documents optimized for speed should never
escape the way between the computer and the printer: no post-processing
is possible.

   <p>What you should remember is that some applications offer the possibility
to tune the PostScript output, and they can be praised for that. 
Unfortunately, when these very same applications don't automatically
switch to &ldquo;Optimize for Portability&rdquo; when you save the PostScript
file, and they can be criticized for that.

   <p>So please, think of the people after you: if you create a PostScript
file meant to be exchanged, read, printed, etc; by other people: give
sane DSC conformant, optimized for portability files.

<h3 class="section">8.2 Page Device Options</h3>

<p>Page device is a PostScript level 2 feature that offers an uniform
interface to control the printer's output device.  a2ps protects all
page device options inside an if block so they have no effect in level 1
interpreters.  Although all level 2 interpreters support page device,
they do not have to support all page device options.  For example some
printers can print in duplex mode and some can not.  Refer to the
documentation of your printer for supported options.

   <p>Here are some usable page device options which can be selected with the
<span class="samp">-S</span> option (<span class="samp">--setpagedevice</span>).  For a complete listing, see
<cite>PostScript Language Reference Manual</cite> (section 4.11 Device Setup
in the second edition, or section 6, Device Control in the third
edition).

<h3 class="section">8.3 Statusdict Options</h3>

<p>The <code>statusdict</code> is a special storage entity in PostScript (called
a <dfn>dictionary</dfn>), in which some variables and operators determine the
behavior of the printer.  This is an historic horror that existed before
page device definitions were defined.  They are even more printer
dependent, and are provided only for the people who don't have a level
printer.  In any case, refer to the documentation of your printer for
supported options.

   <p>Here are some statusdict definitions in which you might be interested:

     <dl>
<dt><code>manualfeed </code><var>boolean</var><dd>Variable which determine that the manual fed paper tray will be used. 
Use is <span class="samp">--statusdict=manualfeed::true</span>.

     <br><dt><code>setmanualfeed </code><var>boolean</var><dd>Idem as the previous point, but use is
<span class="samp">--statusdict=setmanualfeed:true</span>.

     <br><dt><code>setduplexmode </code><var>boolean</var><dd>If <var>boolean</var>, then print Duplex.  Use if

<h3 class="section">8.4 Colors in PostScript</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, here are some tips on how to design your PostScript
styles.  It is strongly recommended to use <span class="file">gray.pro</span> or
<span class="file">color.pro</span> as a template.

   <p>There are two PostScript instructions you might want to use in your new
PostScript prologue:
     <dl>
<dt><code>setgray</code><dd>this instruction must be preceded by a number between 0 (black) and 1
(white).  It defines the gray level used.

     <br><dt><code>setrgbcolor</code><dd>this instruction must be preceded by three numbers between 0 (0 %) and 1
(100%).  Those three numbers are related to red, green and blue
proportions used to designate a color.

   </dl>

   <p>a2ps uses two higher level procedures, <code>BG</code> and <code>FG</code>, but
both use an argument as in <code>setrgbcolor</code>.  So if you wanted a gray
shade, just give three times the same ratio.

<h3 class="section">8.5 a2ps PostScript Files</h3>

<p>a2ps uses several types of PostScript files.  Some are standards, such
as font files, and others are meant for a2ps only.

   <p>All a2ps files have two parts, one being the comments, and the other
being the content, separated by the following line:
<pre class="example">     % code follows this line

<h3 class="section">8.6 Designing PostScript Prologues</h3>

<p>It is pretty known that satisfying the various human tastes is an
NEXPTIME-hard problem, so a2ps offers ways to customize its output
through the <dfn>prologue files</dfn>.  But since the authors feel a little
small against NEXPTIME, they agreed on the fact that <strong>you</strong> are
the one who will design the look you like.

   <p>Hence in this section, you will find what you need to know to be able to
customize a2ps output.

   <p>Basically, a2ps uses <dfn>faces</dfn> which are associated to their
"meaning" in the text.  a2ps let's you change the way the faces look.

<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">8.6.1 Definition of the faces</h4>

<p>There are three things that define a face:
     <dl>
<dt><em>Its font</em><dd>You should never call the font by yourself, because sometimes a2ps may
decide that another font would be better.  This is what happens for
instance if a font does not support the encoding you use.

     <p>Hence, never set the font by yourself, but ask a2ps to do it.  This is
done through a line:
     <pre class="example">          %Face: <var>face</var> <var>real-font-name</var> <var>size</var>
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">This line tells a2ps that the font of <var>face</var> is
<var>real-font-name</var>.  It will replace this line by the correct
PostScript line to call the needed font, and will do everything needed
to set up the font.

     <p>The size of the text body is <code>bfs</code>.

     <br><dt><em>Its background color</em><dd>There are two cases:
          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>You want a background color, then give the <dfn>RGB</dfn> (see <a href="#Colors-in-PostScript">Colors in PostScript</a>) ratio and <code>true</code> to <code>BG</code>:

<h4 class="subsection">8.6.3 A step by step example</h4>

<p>We strongly suggest our readers not to start from scratch, but to copy
one of the available styles (see the result of <span class="samp">a2ps
--list=prologues</span>), to drop it in one of a2ps directories (say
<span class="samp">$HOME/.a2ps</span>, and to patch it until you like it.

   <p>Here, we will start from <span class="file">color.pro</span>, trying to give it a funky
look.

   <p>Say you want the keywords to be in Helvetica, drawn in a flashy pink on
a light green.  And strong keywords, in Times Bold Italic in brown on a
soft Hawaiian sea green (you are definitely a fine art <em>amateur</em>).

   <p>Then you need to look for <span class="samp">k</span> and <span class="samp">K</span>:
<pre class="example">     /k {
       false BG
       0 0 0.9 FG
     %Face: Keyword Courier bfs
       Show
     } bind def
     
     /K {
       false BG
       0 0 0.8 FG
     %Face: Keyword_strong Courier-Bold bfs
       Show
     } bind def
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and turn it into:
<pre class="example">     /k {
       0.2 1 0.2 true BG
       1 0.2 1 FG
     %Face: Keyword Helvetica bfs
       Show
     } bind def
     
     /K {
       0.4 0.2 0 true BG
       0.5 1 1 FG
     %Face: Keyword_strong Times-BoldItalic bfs
       Show
     } bind def
</pre>
   <p>Waouh!  It looks great!

   <p>A bit trickier: let change the way the line numbers are printed.

   <p>First, let's look for the font definition:
<pre class="example">     %%BeginSetup
     % The font for line numbering
     /f# /Helvetica findfont bfs .6 mul scalefont def
     %%EndSetup
</pre>
   <p>Let it be in Times, twice bigger than the body font.
<pre class="example">     %%BeginSetup
     % The font for line numbering
     /f# /Times-Roman findfont bfs 2 mul scalefont def
     %%EndSetup
</pre>
   <p>How about its foreground color?
<pre class="example">     % Function print line number (&lt;string&gt; # -)
     /# {
       gsave
         sx cw mul 2 div neg 0 rmoveto
         f# setfont
         0.8 0.1 0.1 FG
         c-show
       grestore
     } bind def
</pre>
   <p>Let it be blue.  Now you know the process: just put <span class="samp">0 0 1</span> as
<code>FG</code> arguments.

<h3 class="section">9.1 <code>card</code></h3>

<p>Many users of a2ps have asked for a reference card, presenting a
summary of the options.  In fact, something closely related to the
output of <span class="samp">a2ps --help</span>.

   <p>The first version of this reference card was a PreScript file
(see <a href="#PreScript">PreScript</a>) to be printed by a2ps.  Very soon a much better
scheme was found: using a style sheet to pretty print directly the
output of <span class="samp">a2ps --help</span>!  A first advantage is then that the
reference cards can be printed in the tongue you choose.

   <p>A second was that this treatment could be applied to any application
supporting a <span class="samp">--help</span>-like option.

<h3 class="section">9.2 <code>fixps</code></h3>

<p>The shell script <code>fixps</code> tries its best to fix common problems in
PostScript files that may prevent post processing.  It makes heavy use
of the <code>psutils</code>.  It is a good idea to use <code>fixps</code> in the
PostScript delegations.

   <p>It first tries to make simple fixes, but some really broken files may
require a much deeper treatment.  If <code>fixps</code> feels the need for
such a major surgery act, it may give up local changes and ask
<code>Ghostscript</code> for a global rewriting.

<p>I personally hate to print documents of hundreds of pages on a single
sided printer.  Too bad, here there are no Duplex printers.  The idea is
then simply first to print the odd pages, then the even in reversed
order.  To make sure one flips the page in the meanwhile, the second
half should be printed from the manual feed tray.

   <p>Make a shell script that automates this, and you get <code>psmandup</code>.

   <p><code>psmandup</code> assumes the printer is Level 2, and supports manual

<p>The shell script <code>psset</code> inserts calls to <code>setpagedevice</code> in a
PostScript file.  This is useful for instance to add Tumble or Manual
feed request.  Actually, <code>psmandup</code> uses <code>psset</code>.

   <p>You should know nevertheless that a2ps is able to make the calls to
<code>setpagedevice</code> by itself, i.e., you can run <span class="samp">a2ps
-SManualFeed foo</span> to print <span class="file">foo</span> onto the manually fed tray, or run
<span class="samp">a2ps -s2 foo</span> to print Duplex.  There are no need of <code>psset</code>
from a2ps.

<h4 class="subsection">10.1.1 Why Does it Print Nothing?</h4>

<blockquote>
<i>a2ps works OK, but the printer prints nothing.</i>
</blockquote>

   <p>There are two ways that printing can fail: silently, or with a
diagnostic.

   <p>First, <strong>check that the printer received what you sent</strong>.  a2ps
may correctly do its job, but have the printer queue fail to deliver the
job.  In case of doubt, please check that the printer's leds blink (or
whatever is its way to show that something is being processed).

   <p>If the printer does receive the job, but prints nothing at all, check
that you did not give exotic options to an old printer (typically, avoid
printing on two sides on a printer that does not support it).  Avoid
using <span class="samp">-S</span>, <span class="samp">--setpagedevice</span> (see <a href="#Page-Device-Options">Page Device Options</a>)
and <span class="samp">--statusdict</span> (see <a href="#Statusdict-Options">Statusdict Options</a>).

   <p>If the trouble persists, please try again but with the option
<span class="samp">--debug</span> (a PostScript error handler is downloaded), and then send
us:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>the input file that gives problems

     <li>the output file created by a2ps <strong>with the option </strong><span class="samp">--debug</span>

     <li>the error message that was printed.
        </ol>

<blockquote>
<i>Though I ask a2ps to print Duplex via </i><span class="samp">--sides</span><i>, the job is
printed Simplex.</i>
</blockquote>

   <p>If your printer is too old, then a2ps will not be able to send it the
code it needs when <span class="samp">-s2</span> is specified.  This is because your
printer uses an old and not standardized interface for special features.

   <p>So you need to
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>specify that you want Duplex mode: <span class="samp">-s2</span>,

     <li>remove by hand the standardized call to the Duplex feature:
<span class="samp">-SDuplex</span>,

     <li>add the non standard call to Duplex.  Try
<span class="samp">--statusdict=setduplexmode:true</span>.
        </ol>

   <p>Since this is painful to hit, a User Option (see <a href="#Your-Shortcuts">Your Shortcuts</a>)

<blockquote>
<i>Though I ask a2ps to print Simplex via </i><span class="samp">--sides</span><i>, the job is
printed Duplex.</i>
</blockquote>

   <p>Actually when you require Simplex, a2ps issues nothing, for portability
reasons.  Hence, if your printer is defaulted to Duplex, the job will be
Duplexed.  So you have to force a2ps to issue the Simplex request with
<span class="samp">-SDuplex:false</span>.  The user options <span class="samp">-=s1</span> and
<span class="samp">-=simplex</span> have names easier to remember.

   <p>In the next version of a2ps this kind of portability problems will be
fixed in a user friendly way.

<i>When I print text files with a2ps, it prints beyond the frame of

   <p>You are most probably printing with a bad medium, for instance using A4
paper within a2ps, while your printer uses Letter paper.  Some jet
printers have a small printable area, and a2ps may not expect it.  In
both case, read <a href="#Sheet-Options">Sheet Options</a>, option <span class="samp">--medium</span> for more.

<h4 class="subsection">10.1.6 Why Does it Say my File is Binary?</h4>

<blockquote>
<i>a2ps complains that my file is binary though it is not.</i>
</blockquote>

   <p>There are several reasons that can cause a2ps to consider a file is
binary:
     <ul>
<li>there are many non printable characters in the file.  Then you need to
use the option <span class="samp">--print-anyway</span>.

     <li>the file is sane, composed of printable characters.  Then it is very
likely that <code>file(1)</code> said the type of the file is <span class="samp">data</span>, in
which case a2ps prefers not to print the file.  Then you can either:
          <ul>
<li>specify the type of the file, for instance <span class="samp">-Eplain</span>;

          <li>specify to print in any case, <span class="samp">--print-anyway</span>;

          <li>remove the annoying rule from the system's <span class="file">sheets.map</span>:
          <pre class="example">               binary: &lt;data*&gt;
          </pre>
          <li>insert in your own <span class="file">~/.a2ps/sheets.map</span> a rule that overrides that
of the system's <span class="file">sheets.map</span>:
          <pre class="example">               <i># Load the system's sheets.map</i>
               include(/usr/local/share/a2ps/sheets/sheets.map)
               
               <i># Override the rule for files with type `data' according to file(1)</i>
               plain: &lt;data*&gt;
          </pre>
          <p>But this is not very good, since then this rule is always the first
tested, which means that any file with type <span class="samp">data</span> according to
<code>file(1)</code> will be printed in <span class="samp">plain</span> style, even if the file
is called <span class="file">foo.c</span>.

          <li>if your files can be recognized, insert a new rule in a
<span class="file">sheets.map</span>, such as
          <pre class="example">               <i># file(1) says it's data, but it's pure text</i>
               plain:   /*.txx/
          </pre>
          </ul>

 (or </em><span class="samp">--lines-per-page</span><em>, or </em><span class="samp">--chars-per-line</span><em>).</em>
</blockquote>

   <p>This is probably because you used <span class="samp">-1</span>..<span class="samp">-9</span> after the
<span class="samp">--font-size</span>.  This is wrong, because the options
<span class="samp">-1</span>..<span class="samp">-9</span> set the font size (so that there are 80 characters
per lines), and many other things (See <a href="#Page-Options">Page Options</a>, option
<span class="samp">--font-size</span>).

   <p>Hence <span class="samp">a2ps --font-size=12km -4</span> is exactly the same thing as
<span class="samp">a2ps -4</span>, but is different from <span class="samp">a2ps -4 --font-size=12km</span>. 
Note that the `pure' options (no side-effects) to specify the number of

<p>a2ps prints the standard input if you give no file name, or if you gave

weaker: without the file name, a2ps can only get <code>file(1)</code>'s

delegations are safe, but there will probably be no pretty-printing.

<h4 class="subsection">10.2.6 How Can I Print on Non PostScript Printers?</h4>

<blockquote>
<i>I use a2ps at work and wish to use it at home, but my printer is
not PostScript.  How can I do?</i>
</blockquote>

   <p><code>Ghostscript</code> might be the tool you need (see <a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a>).  It
support conversion to many different non PostScript printers.

   <p>Here are some tips on how to use a non PostScript printer.  If somebody
feels like writing a more precise documentation, she really is welcome.

   <p>Please refer to the <code>Ghostscript</code> documentation for a precise
description of the tuning you need.

   <p>Basically, the first step you need is to achieve to call
<code>Ghostscript</code> in a pipe chain.  In other words, try to find out the
right arguments <code>Ghostscript</code> needs in order to print with a
command like this:
<pre class="example">     $ cat file.ps | gs <var>more arguments</var>
</pre>
   <p>In general it is the same command as for calling <code>Ghostscript</code> with
a filename, except that the file name to use is <span class="samp">-</span>:
<pre class="example">     $ cat file.ps \
       | gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=deskjet -sOutputFile=- - -c quit\
       | lp -d<var>printer-name</var>
</pre>
   <p>Once it works, it is then easy to settle the right <code>Printer:</code> line
in your configuration file (see <a href="#Your-Printers">Your Printers</a>).  For instance:
<pre class="example">     Printer: djet \
       | gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=deskjet -sOutputFile=- - -c quit\
       | lp -d djet
</pre>
   <p><a href="mailto:scancm@biobase.dk">Christian Mondrup</a> uses a2ps under Windows
with a non PostScript printer.  He uses:
<pre class="example">     DefaultPrinter: | //c/gstools/gs5.10/Gswin32c.exe         \

<h4 class="subsection">10.3.2 Why Have the Options Changed?</h4>

<blockquote>
<i>The options of this a2ps are not the same as in the previous versions.</i>
</blockquote>

   <p>True.  But the old scheme (up to version 4.6.1) prevented us from
offering more options.  We <strong>had</strong> to drop it, and to fully
redesign the options handling.

   <p>Since that profound change, we try to change as little as possible
between versions.  Nevertheless, as the time passes, we discover that
some never used options should be renamed, or used for something else. 
In these cases, compatibility code is left for a long time.

   <p>Anywhere you put options but the command line (e.g., in a2ps configuration
files or in shell scripts), <strong>avoid using short options</strong>, since short
options are much more likely to be changed (there are not so many, so it is
a precious resource).  Since there are as many long options as one wants,
we can leave compatibility code with the long options.

<h4 class="subsection">10.3.3 Why not having used <code>yacc</code> and such</h4>

<p>There are several reasons why we decided not to use grammars to parse
the files.  Firstly it would have made the design of the style sheets
much more tricky, and today a2ps would know only 4 or 5 languages.

   <p>Secondly, it limits the number of persons who could build a style sheet.

   <p>Thirdly, we did not feel the need for such a powerful tool: handling the
keywords and the sequences is just what the users expect.

   <p>Fourthly, any extension of a2ps would have required to recompile.

   <p>And last but not least, using a parser requires that the sources are
syntactic bug free, which is too strong a requirement.

   <p>Nevertheless, <code>PreScript</code> gives the possibility to have on the one
hand a syntactic parser which would produce <code>PreScript</code> code, and
on the other hand, a2ps, which would make it PostScript.  This schema
seems to us a good compromise.  If it is still not enough for you, you
can use the library.

   <p>But in mozilla, the remote command <code>saveas()</code> does not exist. And we

two kinds of conventions to follow:
          <dl>
<dt>Page Independence<dd>Special comments state where the pages begin and end.  With these
comments (and the fact that the code describing a page starts and ends
somewhere, which is absolutely not necessary in PostScript), very simple
programs (such as <code>psnup</code>, <code>psselect</code> etc.) can post process
PostScript files.

          <br><dt>Requirements<dd>Special features may be needed to run correctly the file.  Some comments
specify what services are expected from the printer (e.g., fonts, duplex
printing, color etc.), and other what features are provided by the file
itself (e.g., fonts, procsets etc.), so that a print manager can decide
that a file cannot be printed on that printer, or that it is possible if
the file is slightly modified (e.g., adding a required font not known by
the printer) etc.

The word <dfn>name</dfn> is used for a symbol, a label, which is only meant
to be nice to read by a human.  For instance <span class="samp">ISO Latin 1</span> is a name. 
a2ps never uses a name, but the key.

     <p>A <dfn>key</dfn> is the identifier of a unique object.  This is information
that a2ps processes, hence, whenever you need to specify an object to
a2ps, use the key, not its name.  For instance <span class="samp">latin1</span> is the
unique identifier of the <span class="samp">ISO Latin 1</span> encoding.

pointers, pictures etc.) and its layout.  <code>HTML</code>, PostScript,
LaTeX, <code>roff</code> and others are such languages.  A file written in
those languages is not made to be read as is by a human, but to be

of hexadecimal digits.  Here these digits are represented by their
value, hence compressing 2 characters in a PFA into 1 in the PFB.  This
is the only advantage since a PFB file cannot be directly sent to
printer: it must first be decompressed (hence turned into a PFA file)
before being used.

     <br><dt><dfn>PostScript</dfn><dd><a name="index-PostScript-458"></a><dfn>PostScript</dfn> is a page description language designed for
<em>Raster output devices</em>.  It is even more powerful than that:
unlike to <code>HTML</code>, or <code>roff</code>, but as TeX and LaTeX, it is
truly a programming language which main purpose is to draw (on sheets). 
Most programs are a list of instructions that describes lines, shades of
gray, or text to draw on a page.  This is the language that most
printers understand.

     <p>Note that the fact that PostScript is a programming language is
responsible of both its success and its failure.  It is a big win for
the PostScript programmer who can easily implement a lot of nice visual
effects.  It is a big loss because the page descriptions can have an
arbitrary complexity, hence rendering can be really slow (remember the
first Laser you had, or even <code>Ghostscript</code>.  <code>PDF</code> has been
invented by Adobe to remedy these problems).

trays, the way to ask it duplex printing, the supported media, etc.

     <p>PostScript has pretended to be a device independent page description
language, and the PPD files are here to prove that
device independence was a failure.

     <br><dt><dfn>Prologue</dfn><dd><a name="index-Prologue-461"></a>PostScript being a language, a typical PostScript program (i.e. a
typical PostScript file) consists of two parts.  The first part is
composed of resources, such as fonts, procsets, etc. and the second part
of calls to these procedures.  The first part is called the
<dfn>prologue</dfn>, and the second, the <dfn>script</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>P-rule</dfn><dd><a name="index-P_002drule-462"></a>Pretty printing rule.  It is composed of a <dfn>left-hand side</dfn>,
(<dfn>lhs</dfn> for short), and a <dfn>right-hand side</dfn>, (<dfn>rhs</dfn>).  The
lhs describes when the rule is triggered (i.e., the pattern of text to
match), and the rhs specifies the pretty printed output.

you resize the frame into which the page is drawn, reorder or select
pages, put several pages onto a single sheet, etc.  To allow the
<code>psutils</code> to run correctly, the PostScript files must be DSC
conformant, and the bad news is that many PostScript drivers produce
files which are not.  For some common cases (e.g., Micro$oft tools),
Angus Duggan included in the package some tools (named <code>fix...ps</code>)
to fix typical problems.  <code>fixps</code> is a collection of recipes on

<h3 class="section">B.1 History</h3>

<p>The initial version was a shell program written by <a href="mailto:evan@csli">Evan Kirshenbaum</a>.  It was very slow and contained many bugs.

   <p>A new version was written in <code>C</code> by <a href="mailto:Miguel.Santana@st.com">Miguel Santana</a> to improve execution speed and portability.  Many new
features and improvements have been added since this first version. 
Many contributions (changes, fixes, ideas) were done by a2ps users in
order to improve it.

   <p>From the latest version from Miguel Santana (4.3), Emmanuel Briot
implemented bold faces for keywords in <code>Ada</code>, <code>C</code> and
<code>C++</code>.

   <p>From that version, <a href="mailto:akim@freefriends.org">Akim Demaille</a>
generalized the pretty-printing capabilities, implemented more languages
support, and other features.

<h3 class="section">B.2 Thanks</h3>

<p>Patrick Andries, from <a href="http://www.alis.com/">Alis Technologies inc.</a>
and Roman Czyborra (see his <a href="http://czyborra.com/">home page</a>),
provided us with important information on encodings.  We strongly
recommend that you go and read these pages: there is a lot to learn.

   <p>Juliusz Chroboczek worked a lot on the integration of the products of
Ogonkify (such as Latin 2 etc. fonts) in a2ps.  Without his help, and
the time is devoted to both a2ps and <code>ogonkify</code>, many non
west-European people would still be unable to print easily texts written
in their mother tongue.

   <p>Denis Girou brought a constant and valuable support through out the
genesis of pretty-printing a2ps.  His comments on both the program
and the documentation are the origin of many pleasant features (such as
<span class="samp">--prologue</span>).

   <p>Alexander Mai provided us with invaluable help in the development.  He
spotted several times subtle bugs in a2ps and the contributions, he
keeps a vigilant eye on portability issues, he checks and improves the
style sheets, and he maintains a port of a2ps for OS/2.

   <p>Graham Jenkins, with an extraordinary regularity, tortures a2ps on
weird systems that nobody ever heard of <span class="samp">:)</span>.  Graham is usually
the ultimate test: if he says I can release a2ps, I rest reassured
that, yes, this time it <strong>will</strong> compile!  If a2ps works today
on your system, you should thank Graham too!

   <p>Of course this list is not up to date, and never will.  We would like to
thank everybody that helped us, talked to us, and even criticized us
with the intention to help us to improve a2ps.  Of course it doesn't
sound right, yes it sounds a little childish, but we can tell you: we
would <strong>never</strong> have the strength and the faith of building and
maintaining a2ps without the support of all these guys.

   <p>While a2ps is finally just a couple of bits on a hard disk, to us it
is an adventure we live with other humans, and, boy, that's a darn good
pleasure!

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> A
classical Unix trick to make the difference between the option
<span class="samp">-2</span>, and the file <span class="file">-2</span> is to type <span class="file">./-2</span>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> That is to say, there
are no PostScript printers that don't understand these files.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> Current <code>a2ps</code>
only handles PostScript output, i.e. <var>out</var>=<span class="samp">ps</span></p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> Because hiding its use into <code>a2ps</code> just makes
it even more difficult to the users to know why it failed.  Let them use
it by hand.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-5" href="#fnd-5">5</a>]</small> Many people seem to ignore
that you can insert <strong>several</strong> sheets in the manual feed tray. 
Try at least once, it will save you from hours spent feeding page per
page by hand!</p>
