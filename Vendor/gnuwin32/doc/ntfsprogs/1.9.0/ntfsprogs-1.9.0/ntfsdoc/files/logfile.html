    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <h3>Other Information</h3>

    <p>
    The logging area consists of a sequence of 4KB log records. Each
    logrecord is structured as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>
    offset(length)   contents
    0(4)             Magic number 'RCRD'
    1E(12)           Fixup
    </pre>

    <p>
    The logrecord supposedly contains a sequence of variable sized records. The
    structuring of those is not clear. File 2 is $LogFile, which contains transaction
    records to guarantee data integrity in case of a system failure. As pp. 37 describe,
    it consists of 2 copies of the restart area, and the 'infinite' logging area.
    </p>

    <p>When you want to write a file on a storage unit, you have to update the file
    itself plus some tables of the filesystem (say as an example the date of the file).
    At this point, you need a transaction made of 2 operations (update the file itself,
    update the date of the file).</p>

    <p>If the transaction is realized, you are sure that your file is written on the
    storage unit, and that the filesystem has been left in a defined state.</p>

    <p>If the transaction is not realized (in case of e.g. power failure, or system
    failure in general), the filesystem is in an undefined state. The only way for you to
    put it back in a defined (and sane) state (this operation is called a roll-back) is
    to log in a special file, the log file, which operations of the transaction have been
    successfully completed.</p>

    <p>At the first access to the disk after a system failure, the system read the log
    file and rolls back all the operations to the beginning of the last transaction.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>When the system writes to the log file, the operation must be atomic and
      immediate.</li>

      <li>
        You can put back your volume in sane state in a short time which is not related
        to the size of your disk but only to the complexity of the transaction that
        failed.

        <p>Note: This operation is not performed by the Windows NT
        chkdsk utility, but by the system: this normal and reliable
        operation is a feature of NTFS.</p>
      </li>

      <li>If your hardware is reliable, you are sure that you always have access to all
      the files of your volume, because it is consistent. But you can't restore eventual
      data losses.</li>
    </ul>

    <pre>
    Log file organization:
    Two restart areas present in the first two pages (restart pages). When
    the volume is unmounted they should be identical.
    These are followed by log records organized in pages headed by a record
    header going up to log file size. Not all pages contain log records when a
    volume is first formatted, but as the volume ages, all records will be used.
    When the log file fills up, the records at the beginning are purged (by
    modifying the oldest_lsn to a higher value presumably) and writing begins
    at the beginning of the file. Effectively, the log file is viewed as a
    circular entity.

    Log file restart page header (begins the restart area).

    struct {
            NTFS_RECORD;                The magic is "RSTR".

                                       this restart page. Only used when the

                                       ntfs.usa_offset value. Then verify that the

                                       way, the offset to the client array has to be
                                       aligned to an 8-byte boundary. Also,
                                       restart_offset + offset to the client array
                                       have to be &lt;lt;= 510. Also, the offset to the
                                       client array + (log_clients * 0xa0) have to
                                       be &lt;lt;= SystemPageSize. = 0x30
            __u64 file_size;        Byte size of the log file. If the
                                       restart_offset + the offset of the file_size
                                       are &gt; 510 then corruption has occured. This
                                       is the very first check when starting with
                                       the restart_area as if it fails it means
                                       that some of the above values will be
                                       corrupted by the multi sector transfer
                                       protection! If the structure is deprotected
                                       then these checks are futile of course.
                                       Calculate the file_size bits and check that
                                       seq_number_bits == 0x43 - file_size bits.

            __u16 record_length;        Byte size of this record. If the version
                                       matches then check that the value of
                                       record_length is a multiple of 8, i.e.
                                       (record_length + 7) &amp; ~7 == record_length.
                                       = 0x30

    Log file client record. Starts at 0x58 even though AFAIU the above it should
    start at 0x60. Something fishy is going on. /-:
    
    struct {
            __u64 oldest_lsn;        Oldest log file sequence number for this
                                       client record. = 0xbd16951d
            __u64 client_restart_lsn;??? = 0x700000, 0x700827, 0x700d07
            __u16 prev_client;        ??? = 0x808, 0xd07, 0xd5d
            __u16 next_client;        ??? = 0x70
            __u16 seq_number;        ??? = 0, 4 size uncertain, Regis calls this
                                       "volume clear flag" and gives a size of one
                                       byte.
            __u16 client_name;       ??? = empty string??? size uncertain
    }  RESTART_CLIENT;

    NOTE: Above client record is followed by 0xffffffff probably to indicate
    the end of the restart area.
    Then there are 8 bytes = 0, then one __u32 = 8, followed by the Unicode
    string "NTFS" and then zeroes till the end of the page.
    Is this important at all?
    
    Log page record page header. Each log page begins with this header and is
    followed by several LOG_RECORD structures.

                    This has nothing to do with the log record. It is only so
                       gcc knows to make the flags 16-bit.

                    __u32 alignment_or_reserved;
            }  lcn_list[0];
    }  LOG_RECORD;

    The restart area (supposedly) has a pointer into the log area, such as
    the first and last log records written and the last checkpoint record
    written. If the restart area is screwed, recovery will be very hard -
    therefore you have two copies of the restart areas.
    Individual log records are identified by logical sequence numbers
    (LSNs). The log area wraps around, but the LSNs don't (at least not
    anytime soon), so they are used for identifying log records instead of
    the offset in the log file.
    Any modification of meta data (such as updating the time stamp that
    the file system was opened) will result in log file actions, which in
    turn result in restart area changes. It might well be that the dirty
    bit is implicit rather than explicit: The file system is clean if the
    last log record says that there are no pending transactions.
