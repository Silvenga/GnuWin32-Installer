<h2 class="chapter">1 The <code>libxmi</code> 2-D Rasterization Library</h2>

<p>This is the documentation for version 2.0 of the GNU <code>libxmi</code> 2-D
rasterization library, which is used by C&nbsp;and C++ programmers. 
It&nbsp;converts 2-D geometrical objects, such as polylines, polygons,
and arcs, to raster patterns.  There is support for setting drawing
attributes, including line width, join style, cap style, and a
multicolored dash pattern.  The objects may be unfilled or filled. 
If&nbsp;the&nbsp;latter, the filling may be a solid color, a&nbsp;stipple
pattern, or a texture.  There is support for sophisticated color-merging
between separately drawn objects.

<h3 class="section">1.1 An overview of <code>libxmi</code></h3>

<p>With the aid of the GNU <code>libxmi</code> library, a C or C++ programmer may
rasterize two-dimensional geometric objects; that&nbsp;is, draw them on a
two-dimensional array of pixels.  The supported objects are points,
polylines, filled polylines (i.e., polygons), rectangles, filled
rectangles, and `arcs': segments of ellipses whose principal axes are
aligned with the coordinate axes.  Like polylines and rectangles, arcs
may be unfilled or filled.

   <p>The corresponding rendering functions in the <code>libxmi</code> API
(application programming interface) are <code>miDrawPoints</code>,
<code>miDrawLines</code>, <code>miFillPolygon</code>, <code>miDrawRectangles</code>,
<code>miFillRectangles</code>, <code>miDrawArcs</code>, and <code>miFillArcs</code>.  Each
of these takes an array, rather than a single object, as an argument. 
For example, one of the arguments of <code>miDrawLines</code> is an array of
points, interpreted as the vertices of a polyline.  The polygon filled
by <code>miFillPolygon</code> is specified similarly.  And the final four
functions render lists of objects, rather than single objects.

   <p>Actually, <code>libxmi</code> provides a two-stage graphics pipeline.  In the
first stage, an opaque object called a <code>miPaintedSet</code> is drawn
onto.  Each of the eight drawing functions takes a pointer to a
<code>miPaintedSet</code> as its first argument.  Conceptually, a
<code>miPaintedSet</code> is an unordered set of points with integer
coordinates, partitioned by pixel value.  The datatype representing a
pixel value is <code>miPixel</code>, which is normally typedef'd as
<code>unsigned int</code>.  Each of the drawing functions takes a pointer to a
<code>miGC</code>, or graphics context, as its second argument.  The
<code>miGC</code> specifies such drawing attributes as line width, join style,
cap style, and dashing style, and also the pixel value(s) to be used in
the painting operation.

   <p>In the first stage of the pipeline the Painter's Algorithm is used, so
that a repeatedly-painted point in a <code>miPaintedSet</code> acquires the
pixel value applied to&nbsp;it in the final drawing operation.  In the
second stage, more sophisticated pixel-merging algorithms may be
applied.  In&nbsp;this stage, a <code>miPaintedSet</code> is copied (`merged')
onto a <code>miCanvas</code>, by invoking <code>miCopyPaintedSetToCanvas</code>. 
A&nbsp;<code>miCanvas</code> is a structure that includes a <code>miPixmap</code>: a
two-dimensional array of <code>miPixel</code>s that may be initialized by the
user, and read, pixel by pixel, after the merging is performed.  By
default, <code>miCopyPaintedSetToCanvas</code> uses the Painter's Algorithm
too, so that the source pixel in the <code>miPaintedSet</code> replaces the
destination pixel in the <code>miCanvas</code>.  But the merging process may
be controlled in much finer detail.  A&nbsp;stipple bitmap and a texture
pixmap, and binary and ternary pixel-merging functions, may be
specified.

   <p>The <em>interpretation</em> of pixel values is left up&nbsp;to the user. 
A&nbsp;<code>miPixel</code> could be an index into a color table.  It&nbsp;could
also be an encoding of a color according to the RGB scheme, the RGBA
scheme, or some other scheme.  Even though a <code>miPixel</code> is normally
an <code>unsigned int</code>, this may be altered, if desired, at the time
<code>libxmi</code> is installed.  Any scalar type or nonscalar type,
including a structure or a union, could be substituted.

   <p><code>libxmi</code> is intended for use both as a standalone library and as a
rendering module that may be incorporated in other packages.  To
facilitate its use in other packages, it may be extensively customized
at installation time.  Besides customizing the definition of
<code>miPixel</code>, it is possible to customize the definition of the
<code>miPixmap</code> datatype, which by default is an array of pointers to
rows of <code>miPixel</code>s.  The default merging algorithm used by
<code>miCopyPaintedSetToCanvas</code> may also be altered: it&nbsp;need not be
the Painter's Algorithm.  For instructions on customization, see the
comments in the <code>libxmi</code> header file <code>xmi.h</code>.

<h3 class="section">1.2 A sample <code>libxmi</code> program</h3>

<p>The following C program uses <code>libxmi</code> to create a
<code>miPaintedSet</code>, draws a dashed polyline and a dashed elliptic arc
on the <code>miPaintedSet</code>, and transfers the painted pixels to a
<code>miCanvas</code> that includes a pixmap of specified size.  Finally, it
writes the pixmap to standard output.

<pre class="example">     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
     #include &lt;xmi.h&gt;            /* public libxmi header file */
     
     int main ()
     {
       miPoint points[4];        /* 3 line segments in the polyline */
       miArc arc;                /* 1 arc to be drawn */
       miPixel pixels[4];        /* pixel values for drawing and dashing */
       unsigned int dashes[2];   /* length of `on' and `off' dashes */
       miGC *pGC;                /* graphics context */
       miPaintedSet *paintedSet; /* opaque object to be painted */
       miCanvas *canvas;         /* drawing canvas (including pixmap) */
       miPoint offset;           /* for miPaintedSet -&gt; miCanvas transfer */
       int i, j;
     
       /* define polyline: vertices are (25,5) (5,5), (5,25), (35,22) */
       points[0].x = 25;  points[0].y = 5;
       points[1].x = 5;   points[1].y = 5;
       points[2].x = 5;   points[2].y = 25;
       points[3].x = 35;  points[3].y = 22;
     
       /* define elliptic arc */

       arc.height = 16;          /* y range of box: 15..31 */
       arc.angle1 = 0 * 64;      /* starting angle (1/64'ths of a degree) */
       arc.angle2 = 270 * 64;    /* angle range (1/64'ths of a degree) */
     
       /* create and modify graphics context */
       pixels[0] = 1;            /* pixel value for `off' dashes, if drawn */

       pixels[2] = 3;            /* another pixel, for multicolored dashes */

       dashes[0] = 4;            /* length of `on' dashes */
       dashes[1] = 2;            /* length of `off' dashes */
       pGC = miNewGC (4, pixels);
       miSetGCAttrib (pGC, MI_GC_LINE_STYLE, MI_LINE_ON_OFF_DASH);

       canvas = miNewCanvas (60, 35, 0);
       offset.x = 0; offset.y = 0;
       miCopyPaintedSetToCanvas (paintedSet, canvas, offset);
     
       /* write canvas's pixmap (a 60x35 array of miPixels) to stdout */
       for (j = 0; j &lt; canvas-&gt;drawable-&gt;height; j++)

           for (i = 0; i &lt; canvas-&gt;drawable-&gt;width; i++)
             /* note: column index precedes row index */

       miClearPaintedSet (paintedSet); /* not necessary */
       miDeletePaintedSet (paintedSet);
     
       return 0;
     }
     </pre>

   <p>This program illustrates how <code>miPaintedSet</code>, <code>miGC</code>, and
<code>miCanvas</code> objects are created and destroyed, as&nbsp;well as
manipulated.  Each of these types has a constructor and a destructor,
named <code>miNew</code><small class="dots">...</small> and <code>miDelete</code><small class="dots">...</small>, respectively.

   <p>When creating a <code>miGC</code> with <code>miNewGC</code>, an array of
<code>miPixel</code>s of length at least&nbsp;2 must be passed as the second
argument.  The first argument, <code>npixels</code>, is the length of the
array.  The default color for drawing operations will be pixel number&nbsp;1 in the array.  The other pixel colors in the array will only be used
when dashing.  In&nbsp;normal (on/off) dashing, the colors of the `on'
dashes will cycle through the colors numbered 1,2,<small class="dots">...</small>,npixels-1 in
the array.  In so-called double dashing, the `off' dashes will be drawn
too, in color number&nbsp;0.

   <p>In the program, the first call to <code>miGCSetAttrib</code> sets the line
mode to <code>MI_LINE_ON_OFF_DASH</code> rather than <code>MI_DOUBLE_DASH</code>. 
This replaces the default, which is <code>MI_LINE_SOLID</code>, meaning no
dashing (only color number&nbsp;1 in the pixel array is used).  An&nbsp;array of dash lengths is then specified by calling
<code>miSetGCDashes</code>.  (The default dash length array, which is
replaced, is <code>{4,4}</code>).  When dashing, the specified dash length
array will be cyclically used.  The first dash will be `on', the second
`off', and so&nbsp;forth.  The third argument to <code>miSetGCDashes</code>
specifies an initial offset into this cyclic pattern.  Currently, the
offset must be nonnegative.

   <p>The second call to <code>miGCSetAttrib</code> sets the line width in the
graphics context.  If&nbsp;the specified line width is positive, lines
and arcs will be drawn with a circular brush whose diameter is equal to
the line width.  All pixels within the brushed region will be painted. 
If&nbsp;the line width is zero, as it is here, a so-called Bresenham
algorithm will be used.  Bresenham lines and arcs are drawn with fewer
pixels than is the case for lines and arcs with width&nbsp;1, and many
people prefer them.

   <p><code>miDrawLines</code> and <code>miDrawArc</code> do the actual drawing.  They are
passed a polyline (i.e., an array of <code>miPoint</code>s) and a
<code>miArc</code>, respectively.  The definitions of the <code>miPoint</code> and
<code>miArc</code> structures appear in the header file <code>xmi.h</code>, which is
worth examining.  The third argument of <code>miDrawLines</code>,
<code>MI_COORD_MODE_ORIGIN</code>, specifies that the points of the polyline,
after the first, are expressed in absolute rather than relative
coordinates.

   <p>Finally, the program transfers the painted pixels to a <code>miCanvas</code>,
and copies the pixels from it to standard output.  A&nbsp;<code>miCanvas</code>, unlike a <code>miPaintedSet</code> and a <code>miGC</code>, is not
an opaque object, so its elements may be read (and written).  In&nbsp;fact, a <code>miCanvas</code> may be constructed by hand and passed to the
<code>miCopyPaintedSetToCanvas</code> function.  However, it is usually
easiest to use the constructor <code>miNewCanvas</code> and the destructor
<code>miDeleteCanvas</code>.  Any <code>miCanvas</code> created with
<code>miNewCanvas</code> is allocated on the heap, with <code>malloc</code>.  It&nbsp;includes a pixmap (an&nbsp;array of <code>miPixel</code>s, of specified size)
that is itself allocated on the heap.

   <p>It is only when the painted pixels are transferred from
<code>miPaintedSet</code> to <code>miCanvas</code> that clipping to a pixmap takes
place.  Drawing to a <code>miPaintedSet</code> is entirely unclipped: at&nbsp;least in principle, the <code>miPaintedSet</code> is of potentially infinite
extent.  However, the pixmap in the <code>miCanvas</code> created by
<code>miNewCanvas (60, 35, 0)</code> has upper left corner <code>(0,0)</code> and
lower right corner <code>(59,34)</code>.  Out-of-bound painted pixels, if&nbsp;any, will not be transferred.

   <p>The third argument of <code>miNewCanvas</code> is its <code>initPixel</code>
argument: the pixel value to&nbsp;which each <code>miPixel</code> in the pixmap
is initialized.  Since this value is&nbsp;`0', the pixmap that is sent to
standard output will display the dashed polyline and arc in the `2',
`3', and&nbsp;`4' colors, on a background of zeroes.

<h3 class="subsection">1.3.1 Opaque data structures</h4>

<p>The drawing functions used in the first stage of the <code>libxmi</code>
graphics pipeline paint pixels on a <code>miPaintedSet</code>. 
A <code>miPaintedSet</code> should be thought of as an unordered set of points
with integer coordinates, partitioned according to pixel value.  Any
pixel value is a <code>miPixel</code>, which in most <code>libxmi</code>
installations is typedef'd as an <code>unsigned int</code>.

   <p>A <code>miPaintedSet</code> is an opaque object that must be accessed through
a pointer.  The functions

<pre class="example">     miPaintedSet * miNewPaintedSet (void);
     void miDeletePaintedSet (miPaintedSet *paintedSet);
     </pre>

<p>are the constructor and destructor for the <code>miPaintedSet</code> type. 
The function

<pre class="example">     void miClearPaintedSet (miPaintedSet *paintedSet);
     </pre>

<p>clears all pixels from a <code>miPaintedSet</code>, i.e., makes it the empty
set.

   <p>All drawing functions that paint pixels on a <code>miPaintedSet</code> take a
pointer to a graphics context as an argument.  A&nbsp;graphics context is
an opaque object, called a <code>miGC</code>, that contains drawing
parameters.  The functions

<pre class="example">     miGC * miNewGC (int npixels, const miPixel *pixels);
     void miDeleteGC (miGC *pGC);
     miGC * miCopyGC (const miGC *pGC);
     </pre>

<p>are the constructor, destructor, and copy constructor for the
<code>miGC</code> type.  The arguments of <code>miNewGC</code> specify an array of
<code>miPixel</code>s, which must have length at least&nbsp;2.  The default
color for drawing operations will be pixel number&nbsp;1 in the array. 
The other pixel colors in the array will only be used when dashing. 
In&nbsp;normal (on/off) dashing, the colors of the `on' dashes will cycle
through the colors numbered 1,2,<small class="dots">...</small>,npixels-1.  In so-called double
dashing, the `off' dashes will be drawn too, in color number&nbsp;0.

   <p>The array of pixel colors may be modified at any later time, by invoking
the function <code>miSetGCPixels</code>.

<pre class="example">     void miSetGCPixels (miGC *pGC, int npixels, const miPixel *pixels);
     </pre>

<p>is the declaration of this function.

   <p>The lengths of dashes, when dashing, may be set by invoking
<code>miSetGCDashes</code>.  It has declaration

<pre class="example">     void miSetGCDashes (miGC *pGC, int ndashes, const unsigned int *dashes,
                         int offset);
     </pre>

<p>Here <code>dashes</code> is an array of length <code>ndashes</code>.  The array is
cyclically used.  The first dash in a polyline or arc will be an `on'
dash of length <code>dashes[0]</code>; the next dash will be an `off' dash of
length <code>dashes[1]</code>; and so forth.  The default dash length array in
any <code>miGC</code> is <code>{4,4}</code>.  The dash length array need not have
the same length as the pixel color array, and it need not have even
length.  <code>offset</code>, if nonzero, is an initial offset into the dash
pattern.  For example, if it equals <code>dashes[0]</code> then the first dash
will be an `off' dash of length <code>dashes[1]</code>.  Currently,
<code>offset</code> must be nonnegative.

   <p>Besides the array of pixel colors and the array of dash lengths, any
<code>miGC</code> contains several attributes whose values are <code>enum</code>s,
and an integer-valued line width attribute.  Any one of these may be set
by invoking <code>miSetGCAttrib</code>, and any list of them by invoking
<code>miSetGCAttribs</code>.  The declarations of these functions are:

<pre class="example">     typedef enum { MI_GC_FILL_RULE, MI_GC_JOIN_STYLE, MI_GC_CAP_STYLE,
                     MI_GC_LINE_STYLE, MI_GC_ARC_MODE, MI_GC_LINE_WIDTH
                  } miGCAttribute;
     void miSetGCAttrib (miGC *pGC, miGCAttribute attribute, int value);
     void miSetGCAttribs (miGC *pGC, int nattributes,
                          const miGCAttribute *attributes,
                          const int *values);
     </pre>

<p>These attributes are similar to the drawing attributes used in the X&nbsp;Window System.  The allowed values for the attribute
<code>MI_GC_FILL_RULE</code>, which specifies the rule used when filling
polygons and arcs, are:

<pre class="example">     enum { MI_EVEN_ODD_RULE, MI_WINDING_RULE };
     </pre>

<p>The default is <code>MI_EVEN_ODD_RULE</code>.  The allowed values for the
attribute <code>MI_GC_JOIN_STYLE</code>, which specifies the rule used when
joining polylines and polyarcs, are:

<pre class="example">     enum { MI_JOIN_MITER, MI_JOIN_ROUND, MI_JOIN_BEVEL,
             MI_JOIN_TRIANGULAR };
     </pre>

<p>The default is <code>MI_JOIN_MITER</code>.  The allowed values for the
attribute <code>MI_GC_CAP_STYLE</code>, which specifies the rule used when
capping the ends of polylines and arcs, are:

<pre class="example">     enum { MI_CAP_NOT_LAST, MI_CAP_BUTT, MI_CAP_ROUND, MI_CAP_PROJECTING,
             MI_CAP_TRIANGULAR };
     </pre>

<p>The default is <code>MI_CAP_BUTT</code>.  The allowed values for the
attribute <code>MI_GC_LINE_STYLE</code>, which specifies whether or not
dashing should take place when drawing polylines and arcs, are:

<pre class="example">     enum { MI_LINE_SOLID, MI_LINE_ON_OFF_DASH, MI_LINE_DOUBLE_DASH };
     </pre>

<p>The default is <code>MI_LINE_SOLID</code>.  The allowed values for the
attribute <code>MI_GC_ARC_MODE</code>, which specifies how arcs should be
filled, are:

<pre class="example">     enum { MI_ARC_CHORD, MI_ARC_PIE_SLICE };
     </pre>

<p>The default is <code>MI_ARC_PIE_SLICE</code>.

   <p>Finally, the value for the line width, i.e., for the
<code>MI_GC_LINE_WIDTH</code> attribute, may be any nonnegative integer.  The
default is&nbsp;0, which has a special meaning.  Zero-width lines and
arcs are not invisible.  Instead, they are drawn with a Bresenham
algorithm, which paints fewer pixels than is the case for lines with
width&nbsp;1.

   <p>Any <code>miGC</code> also contains a miter-limit attribute, which, if the
join mode attribute has value <code>MI_JOIN_MITER</code> and the line width is
at least&nbsp;1, will affect the drawing of the joins in polylines and
polyarcs.  At&nbsp;any join point, the `miter length' is the distance
between the inner corner and the outer corner.  The miter limit is the
maximum value that can be tolerated for the miter length divided by the
line width.  If&nbsp;this value is exceeded, the miter will be `cut&nbsp;off': the <code>MI_JOIN_BEVEL</code> join mode will be used instead.

   <p>The function

<pre class="example">     void miSetGCMiterLimit (miGC *pGC, double miter_limit);
     </pre>

<p>sets the value of this attribute.  The specified value must be greater
than or equal to&nbsp;1.0.  That is because the miter limit is the
cosecant of one-half of the minimum join angle for mitering, so values
less than&nbsp;1.0 are meaningless.  The default value for the miter
limit is 10.43, as in the X&nbsp;Window System.  10.43&nbsp;is the
cosecant of 5.5 degrees, so by default, miters will be cut&nbsp;off if
the join angle is less than 11&nbsp;degrees.

<h3 class="subsection">1.3.2 The first stage of the graphics pipeline</h4>

<p>In the first stage of the <code>libxmi</code> graphics pipeline, one or more
of the core drawing functions is invoked.  Each drawing function takes
pointers to a <code>miPaintedSet</code> and a <code>miGC</code> (a&nbsp;graphics
context) as its first and second arguments.  It&nbsp;will paint pixels in
the <code>miPaintedSet</code>, according to the drawing parameters in the
graphics context.

   <p>The drawing functions fall into three groups: (1) functions that draw
points, polylines, and polygons, (2)&nbsp;functions that draw rectangles,
and (3)&nbsp;functions that draw `arcs' (segments of ellipses whose
principal axes are aligned with the coordinate axes).  We&nbsp;discuss
these three groups in&nbsp;turn.

   <p>The point/polyline/polygon group includes:

<pre class="example">     void miDrawPoints (miPaintedSet *paintedSet, const miGC *pGC,
                        miCoordMode mode, int npts, const miPoint *pPts);
     void miDrawLines (miPaintedSet *paintedSet, const miGC *pGC,
                       miCoordMode mode, int npts, const miPoint *pPts);
     void miFillPolygon (miPaintedSet *paintedSet, const miGC *pGC,
                         miPolygonShape shape,
                         miCoordMode mode, int npts, const miPoint *pPts);
     </pre>

<p>The final three arguments of each are a coordinate mode, a specified
number of points, and an array that contains that number of points. 
<code>miDrawPoints</code> draws the array as a cloud of points,
<code>miDrawLines</code> draws a polyline defined by the array, and
<code>miFillPolygon</code> fills a polygon defined by the array.  The
<code>mode</code> argument specifies whether the points in the array, after
the first, are in absolute or relative coordinates.  Its possible values
are:

<pre class="example">     typedef enum { MI_COORD_MODE_ORIGIN,
                     MI_COORD_MODE_PREVIOUS } miCoordMode;
     </pre>

<p>The <code>miPoint</code> structure is defined by

<pre class="example">     typedef struct
     {
       int x, y;	/* integer coordinates, y goes downward */
     } miPoint;
     </pre>

<p>The additional <code>shape</code> argument of <code>miFillPolygon</code> is
advisory.  Its possible values are:

<pre class="example">     typedef enum { MI_SHAPE_GENERAL, MI_SHAPE_CONVEX } miPolygonShape;
     </pre>

<p>They indicate whether the polygon is (1) unconstrained (i.e., not
necessarily convex, with self-intersections allowed), or (2)&nbsp;convex
and not self-intersecting.  The latter case can be drawn more rapidly.

   <p>The rectangle group includes

<pre class="example">     void miDrawRectangles (miPaintedSet *paintedSet, const miGC *pGC,
                            int nrects, const miRectangle *pRects);
     void miFillRectangles (miPaintedSet *paintedSet, const miGC *pGC,
                            int nrects, const miRectangle *pRects);
     </pre>

<p>The final two arguments of each are a specified number of rectangles and
an array that contains that number of rectangles. 
<code>miDrawRectangles</code> draws the outline of each rectangle, and
<code>miFillRectangle</code> fills each rectangle.  The <code>miRectangle</code>
structure is defined by

<pre class="example">     typedef struct
     {
       int x, y;                   /* upper left corner of rectangle */
       unsigned int width, height; /* dimensions: width&gt;=1, height&gt;=1 */
     } miRectangle;
     </pre>

<p>The rectangle group is redundant, since a rectangle is a special sort of
polyline, defined by a five-point point array in which the last point is
the same as the first.

   <p>The arc group includes

<pre class="example">     void miDrawArcs (miPaintedSet *paintedSet, const miGC *pGC,
                      int narcs, const miArc *parcs);
     void miFillArcs (miPaintedSet *paintedSet, const miGC *pGC,
                      int narcs, const miArc *parcs);
     </pre>

<p>The final two arguments of each are a specified number of arcs and an
array that contains that number of arcs.  <code>miDrawArcs</code> draws each
arc.  It&nbsp;will join successive arcs, if they are contiguous,
according to the `join mode' in the graphics context.  Similarly,
<code>miFillArcs</code> will fill each arc according to the `arc mode' in the
graphics context.  Either a pie slice or a chord will be filled.

   <p>The <code>miArc</code> structure is defined by

<pre class="example">     typedef struct
     {
       int x, y;           /* upper left corner of ellipse's bounding box */
       unsigned int width, height; /* dimensions: width&gt;=1, height&gt;=1 */
       int angle1, angle2; /* initial angle, angle range (in 1/64 degrees) */
     } miArc;
     </pre>

<p><code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> specify a rectangle
aligned with the coordinate axes, and <code>angle1</code>, <code>angle2</code>
specify an angular range (a `pie slice') of an ellipse inscribed in the
rectangle.  By convention, they are the starting polar angle and angle
range of the circular arc that would be produced from the elliptic arc
by squeezing the rectangle into a square.

   <p><code>miDrawArcs</code> maintains a cache of rasterized ellipses.  This cache
is persistent, and internal to <code>libxmi</code>; accordingly,
<code>miDrawArcs</code> is not reentrant.  For applications in which
reentrancy is important, a reentrant counterpart is provided.  It&nbsp;is

<pre class="example">     void miDrawArcs_r (miPaintedSet *paintedSet, const miGC *pGC,
                        int narcs, const miArc *parcs,
                        miEllipseCache *ellipseCache);
     </pre>

<p>The caller of <code>miDrawArcs_r</code> must supply a pointer to a
<code>miEllipseCache</code> object as the final argument.  A&nbsp;pointer to
such an object, which is opaque, is returned by
<code>miNewEllipseCache</code>.  After zero or more calls to
<code>miDrawArcs_r</code>, the object would be deleted by a call to
<code>miDeleteEllipseCache</code>.  The declarations

<pre class="example">     miEllipseCache * miNewEllipseCache (void);
     void miDeleteEllipseCache (miEllipseCache *ellipseCache);
     </pre>

<p>are supplied in the header file <code>xmi.h</code>.

<h3 class="subsection">1.3.3 The second stage of the graphics pipeline</h4>

<p>In the second state of the graphics pipeline, the pixels in a
<code>miPaintedSet</code> are transferred (`merged') to a <code>miCanvas</code>, by
invoking <code>miCopyPaintedSetToCanvas</code>.  It&nbsp;is only when the
painted pixels are transferred to a <code>miCanvas</code> that clipping to a
pixmap takes place.

   <p>A&nbsp;<code>miCanvas</code> is a structure that includes a pixmap and several
parameters that control the transfer of pixels.  Since it is not opaque,
it may be constructed and modified by&nbsp;hand, if necessary.  The
<code>miCanvas</code> type has definition

<pre class="example">     typedef struct
     {
       miCanvasPixmap *drawable;   /* the pixmap */
     
       miBitmap *stipple;          /* a mask, if non-NULL */
       miPoint stippleOrigin;      /* placement of upper left corner */
     
       miPixmap *texture;          /* a texture, if non-NULL */
       miPoint textureOrigin;      /* placement of upper left corner */
     
       miPixelMerge2 pixelMerge2;  /* binary merging function, if non-NULL */
       miPixelMerge3 pixelMerge3;  /* ternary counterpart, if non-NULL */
     } miCanvas;
     </pre>

<p>Here, the <code>miBitmap</code> and <code>miPixmap</code> types are defined by

<pre class="example">     typedef struct
     {
       int **bitmap;               /* each element is 0 or 1 */
       unsigned int width;
       unsigned int height;
     }
     miBitmap;
     </pre>

<pre class="example">     typedef struct
     {
       miPixel **pixmap;           /* each element is a miPixel */
       unsigned int width;
       unsigned int height;
     }
     miPixmap;
     </pre>

<p>That is, each of them contains an array of pointers to rows (of&nbsp;integers or pixel values, as the case may&nbsp;be).  In&nbsp;most
installations of <code>libxmi</code>, <code>miCanvasPixmap</code> is typedef'd as
<code>miPixmap</code>.  The typedefs

<pre class="example">     typedef miPixel (*miPixelMerge2) (miPixel source, miPixel destination);
     typedef miPixel (*miPixelMerge3) (miPixel texture, miPixel source,
                                       miPixel destination);
     </pre>

<p>define the datatypes of the binary and ternary pixel-merging function
members.

   <p>The functions

<pre class="example">     miCanvas * miNewCanvas (unsigned int width, unsigned int height,
                             miPixel initPixel);
     void miDeleteCanvas (miCanvas *pCanvas);
     miCanvas * miCopyCanvas (const miCanvas *pCanvas);
     </pre>

<p>are the constructor, destructor, and copy constructor for the
<code>miCanvas</code> type.  Rather than a <code>miCanvas</code> being created by&nbsp;hand, <code>miNewCanvas</code> is usually used instead.  The <code>initPixel</code>
argument is a <code>miPixel</code> value with which the newly allocated pixmap
should be filled.  The <code>stipple</code> and <code>texture</code> pointers in a
newly created <code>miCanvas</code> are <code>NULL</code>, as are the pixel-merging
function members.  The four convenience functions

<pre class="example">     void miSetCanvasStipple (miCanvas *pCanvas, const miBitmap *pStipple,
                              miPoint stippleOrigin);
     void miSetCanvasTexture (miCanvas *pCanvas, const miPixmap *pTexture,
                              miPoint textureOrigin);
     void miSetPixelMerge2 (miCanvas *pCanvas, miPixelMerge2 pixelMerge2);
     void miSetPixelMerge3 (miCanvas *pCanvas, miPixelMerge3 pixelMerge3);
     </pre>

<p>may be used to set these members.

   <p>The <code>miCopyPaintedSetToCanvas</code> function, which implements the
second stage of the graphics pipeline, can now be discussed.  It&nbsp;has
declaration

<pre class="example">     void miCopyPaintedSetToCanvas (const miPaintedSet *paintedSet,
                                    miCanvas *canvas, miPoint origin);
     </pre>

<p>where <code>origin</code> is the point on the <code>miCanvas</code> to which the
point <code>(0,0)</code> in the <code>miPaintedSet</code> is mapped.  (It&nbsp;could
equally well be called <code>offset</code>.)

   <p>The semantics of <code>miCopyPaintedSet</code> boil down to a single issue:
how a `source' pixel in a <code>miPaintedSet</code> is merged onto the
corresponding `destination' pixel in a <code>miCanvas</code> to form a new
pixel.  The simplest case is when no texture is specified (the
corresponding pointer in the <code>miCanvas</code> is <code>NULL</code>).  In&nbsp;that case, if the binary pixel-merging function member of the
<code>miCanvas</code> is <code>NULL</code>, a default merging algorithm will be
used.  In&nbsp;most <code>libxmi</code> installations this is the Painter's
Algorithm: the new pixel in the <code>miCanvas</code> will simply be the
source pixel.  If,&nbsp;on the other hand, the binary pixel-merging
function in the <code>miCanvas</code> is non-<code>NULL</code>, it&nbsp;will be used
to compute the new pixel.

   <p>A texture pixmap may be specified.  If so, it will be extended
periodically so as to cover the <code>miCanvas</code>, and its value at the
location of the destination pixel will affect the merging process. 
If&nbsp;the ternary pixel-merging function member of the <code>miCanvas</code>
is <code>NULL</code>, a default merging algorithm, appropriate to the case
when a texture is present, will be used.  In&nbsp;most <code>libxmi</code>
installations this is a variant of the Painter's Algorithm: the new
pixel in the <code>miCanvas</code> will be the texture pixel, rather than the
source pixel.  If,&nbsp;on the other hand, the ternary pixel-merging
function in the <code>miCanvas</code> is non-<code>NULL</code>, it&nbsp;will be used
to compute the new pixel.

   <p>Any <code>miCanvas</code> may also include a pointer to a stipple bitmap. 
If&nbsp;so, it will be extended periodically so as to cover the
<code>miCanvas</code>, and its value at the location of the destination pixel
will determine whether or not its replacement by a new pixel, according
to one of the preceding rules, will take place.  If&nbsp;the stipple
value is zero, it&nbsp;will not; otherwise it will.  Stipple bitmaps are
useful for creating so-called screen door patterns, and more generally
for protecting, or masking&nbsp;off, part of a <code>miCanvas</code>.

<p><code>libxmi</code> is based on the machine-independent 2-D graphics routines
in the X11 sample server code.  Those routines fill polygons and draw
wide polygonal lines and arcs.  They were written by Brian Kelleher,
Joel McCormack, Todd Newman, Keith Packard, Robert Scheifler and Ken
Whaley, who worked for Digital Equipment Corp., MIT, and/or the X&nbsp;Consortium, and are copyright &copy; 1985-89 by the X&nbsp;Consortium.

   <p>In 1998-99, <a href="mailto:rsm@math.arizona.edu">Robert Maier</a> extracted the
graphics routines from the sample server code in the X11R6 distribution,
converted them to ANSI&nbsp;C, and added extensive comments.  He&nbsp;also
introduced data structures appropriate for a two-stage graphics
pipeline, and converted the graphics routines to use them.  He&nbsp;added
some new rendering features, such as support for multicolored dashing.

   <p>The modified code was first released by being incorporated in version
2.2 of the GNU <code>plotutils</code> package, as a rendering module for
export of PNM and pseudo-GIF files.  See the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html"><code>plotutils</code> home page</a>.  After further modifications, the code was
released as the standalone <code>libxmi</code> library.
