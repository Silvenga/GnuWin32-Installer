Note to re-distributors of hodie

The copyright notice and the License terms are to be included in every
distribution or redistribution of the program and/or its source codes.

The name of the file including these, may be as the distributor wishes
_AS_ _LONG_ _AS_ it is still clear where to find it.

I.e. permutations such as renaming it to 'copyright' instead of 'LICENSE'
or similar renamings is perfectly ok, and may be done without consulting
the author.

Permutations such as renaming it to 'BAD_VBA_VIRUS' '00_index' or other
utterly misleading names, is not wished for; should be done only after
consulting the author _AND_ receiving his blessing for the renaming --
which is unlikely anyway.

Shadow zones may always be resolved by emailing the author.

This code is licensed under the MIT license. I chose the MIT because I've
read it and understood it. I still haven't managed to plough throw the
tonnes of legalese that constitute the GPL, and I won't release under GPL
until I've read and understood it. Explaining the GPL to me won't help.

I have nothing principally against relicensing it under another license if
you need it -- mail me and ask. I still have the requirement though that I
must read it, understand it and approve of it before the license is
changed.

You may of course -- as stated in the license -- redistribute it under a
new sub-license. This license may broaden, but not restrict the MIT
license. The MIT license must still be included in the new distribution --
granting anyone the right to relicense it once again.


And, please contact me if you plan to distribute it. I'm such a fan of
hearing what became of my toy project :-)
