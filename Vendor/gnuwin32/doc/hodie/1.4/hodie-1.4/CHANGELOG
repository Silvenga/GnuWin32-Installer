0.4
	Was capable of converting the date and printing it verbosely. No
	command line options accepted.

0.7
	Had a man-page, certain command line options and a brief
	error/usage message.
0.8
	Implemented the ab urbe condita mode of dates and a version
	option. 
1.0pre
	Tried building a RPM-package of it.
1.0
	Grammar checked. Due to grammar details, internal representation was
	slightly changed (had to cover both ablative and accusative in the
	verbose output).  
1.1 
	Verbosified ab urbe condita display as well. Bug fixes
	arriving on first day online fixed (platform-specific coding
	and bad month calculations).  
1.2 
	Modularised code structure... Now it is organised after one
	function, one source file, and the makefile and headers have
	been hacked to support this. 

	Man page partially rewritten. Tnx to Ted Rolle for his
	extensive tips on improvements. 

	__isleap portability issues resolved. I simply replaced all
	calls to it with calls to my own leap-year calculator.

	The  --version call is more extensive and even contains a few
	words about licensing and author :-)

	The republican switch is added, as well as a BUGS and a
	CREDITS file to the tarball.

	The month handling is slightly redone, removing all those
	nasty bugs I found as soon as I was able to play around with
	the dates on my own :-) 
1.3
	Modularized the help-texts and error messages. At least a
	bit. Those of you interested in translating the english bits
	of hodie into other languages will find most of what you need
	in strings.h.en and the manual in hodie.1.en. I will include a
	diff from the last release of these two files to allow for
	simple incremental translation. Kudos to Jose Ivan Juanes for
	doing a translation into spanish for me! 

	Fixed the core-dumping bugs. I think. Mail me if it still
	screws up. 
1.4pre
	New feature: extremely verbose display. Declines the number of
	days till the next main day as well instead of just displaying
	it as a roman numeral.

	The sourcefile split of version 1.3 has transceded into split
	source branches instead. It's easier to maintain that way...

	sscanf changed to atoi in several places in the
	parse_date.c-file -- improved security (atoi actually checks
	data and does other neat stuff :-)
	Support for any separator in date parsing added (i.e. it's
	done by a 'sscanf(str,"%d%c%d%c%d"...)' instead of a
	'sscanf(str,"%d-%d-%d"...)'. 

	Display of numerals off as default - -x turns it on.

1.4
	'extremely verbose display' now _implemented_. The function
	taking care of the declensions will be basis for another,
	parallel program to hodie -- that simply will put out any
	number in any of the wanted forms, declined as asked for.

	Support for this kind of program lies in the to_roman.c file,
	but the actual program is not yet implemented. (Due to large
	parts of my audience in this question, a Windoze port of hodie
	is coming up :-)
