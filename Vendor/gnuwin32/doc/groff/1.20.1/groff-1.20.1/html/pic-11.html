<h2>11. Object Groups
<a name="11. Object Groups"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two different ways to
group objects in <b>pic</b>; <i>brace grouping</i> and
<i>block composites</i>.</p>

<h3>11.1. Brace Grouping
<a name="11.1. Brace Grouping"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simpler method is simply to
group a set of objects within curly bracket or brace
characters. On exit from this grouping, the current position
and direction are restored to their value when the opening
brace was encountered.</p>

<h3>11.2. Block Composites
<a name="11.2. Block Composites"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A block composite object is
created a series of commands enclosed by square brackets.
The composite can be treated for most purposes like a single
closed object, with the size and shape of its bounding box.
Here is an example. The program fragment</p>

<pre style="margin-left:10%; margin-top: 1em">A: [
    circle;
    line up 1 at last circle .n;
    line down 1 at last circle .s;
    line right 1 at last circle .e;
    line left 1 at last circle .w;
    box dashed with .nw at last circle .se + (0.2, -0.2);
    Caption: center of last box;
]</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">yields the block in figure 11-1,
which we show both with and without its attachment points.
The block&rsquo;s location becomes the value of
<b>A</b>.</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em">Figure 11-1: A
sample composite object</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To refer to one of the
composite&rsquo;s attachment points, you can say (for
example) <b>A .s</b>. For purposes of object naming,
composites are a class. You could write <b>last [] .s</b> as
an equivalent reference, usable anywhere a location is
needed. This construction is very important for putting
together large, multi-part diagrams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blocks are also a
variable-scoping mechanism, like a <i>groff</i>(1)
environment. All variable assignments done inside a block
are undone at the end of it. To get at values within a
block, write a name of the block followed by a dot, followed
by the label you want. For example, we could refer the the
center of the box in the above composite as <b>last []
.Caption</b> or <b>A.Caption</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This kind of reference to a
label can be used in any way any other location can be. For
example, if we added <b>&quot;Hi!&quot; at A.Caption</b> the
result would look like this:</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em">Figure 11-2:
Adding a caption using interior labeling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use interior labels
in either part of a <b>with</b> modifier. This means that
the example composite could be placed relative to its
caption box by a command containing <b>with A.Caption
at</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that both width and height
of the block composite object are always positive:</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em">Figure 11-3:
Composite block objects always have positive width and
height</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blocks may be nested. This means
you can use block attachment points to build up complex
diagrams hierarchically, from the inside out. Note that
<b>last</b> and the other sequential naming mechanisms
don&rsquo;t look inside blocks, so if you have a program
that looks like</p>

<pre style="margin-left:10%; margin-top: 1em">.PS
P: [box &quot;foo&quot;; ellipse &quot;bar&quot;];
Q: [
     [box &quot;baz&quot;; ellipse &quot;quxx&quot;]
     &quot;random text&quot;;
   ]
arrow from 2nd last [];
.PE</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">the arrow in the last line is
attached to object <b>P</b>, not object <b>Q</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In DWB <b>pic</b>, only
references one level deep into enclosed blocks were
permitted. GNU <b>gpic</b> removes this restriction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The combination of block
variable scoping, assignability of labels and the macro
facility that we&rsquo;ll describe later on can be used to
simulate functions with local variables (just wrap the macro
body in block braces).</p>
