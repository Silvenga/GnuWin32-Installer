is LGPL, the

multiple licenses. The following will hopefully be helpful for you to
understand what is covered by which license.<br>

<ul>
  <li>EDLL (the library: edll.h and src/*.[ch], except ltdl.c)</li>
</ul>
This library is covered by the <a href="lgpl.html">GNU Less General
Public License</a>. This more or less means you can freely copy and
distribute this library in source and binary form. However, if you
modify the source code, you need to share the changes. If your
application links with a version of the EDLL library in binary form,
you
don't need to share the source code of your application.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>The tests and examples<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The different tests and examples coming with the EDLL library are
public
domain. This means anyone is free to use, copy, redistribute, modify,
etc. all of these files. They are not of much interest anyway except to
test the functionality of the EDLL library.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">The image on the top-right shows the
result of the edll-bss plugin. It creates a circle using sinf() and
cosf() for which it needs to be linked against the mingwex library and
it uses a large COMMON section (256 x 256 x 3).</span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>LibTool dynamic loader (ltdl.c and ltdl.h)</li>
</ul>
A copy of this library is offered in this package since it can be used
to load the plug-ins using the standard <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">lt_dlopen()</span>
function. This version understands and makes use of the EDLL library
instead of directly calling the MS-Windows <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">LoadLibrary()</span> function.<br>
<br>
The license of this library is <a href="lgpl.html">LGPL</a>. You can
find additional information about this package on the <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU website</a>.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>The EDLL Documentation</li>
</ul>
The documentation offered along the EDLL is covered by the <a
 href="fdl.html">GNU FDL</a>.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>The BFD and iberty libraries<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<img alt="Warning!" src="images/warning.gif"
 style="width: 50px; height: 51px;" align="left">The older versions of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">edll</span> (up
to 0.5) could only be used with the BFD and iberty libraries (that you
needed to link against along with the EDLL). Because these two
libraries are licensed under the <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>, it means that
your code will also fall under the GPL. As you probably know, this
means you need to distribute <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span>
the source code along any of your software linked against these
libraries.<br>
<br>
I spent about 12 hours to rewrite the necessary code to handle the COFF
format. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">edll</span> is now
capable of loading the .exe and .o files generated by gcc and g++ (and
most certainly other compilers, especially for the .exe files.) This is
now the default for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">edll</span>.
It means you are not bound to the GPL, but also, it means the code only
support the Microsoft COFF format (and not all of it). Maybe one day we
could have support for ELF so we can compile all the plugins on native
Linux and run them on Microsoft as is. On the other hand, you should be
able to ask gcc/g++ to generate COFF files under Linux (I should try
that some day!).<br>
<br>
The configure flags you can use to switch between the edll COFF
handling and the BFD and iberty libraries is:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>--disable-usebfd&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(this is the default)</span><br>
</code><code>--enable-usebfd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(GPL license!)</span><br>
</code></div>
<br>
<table style="text-align: left;" border="0" cellpadding="0"
 cellspacing="5">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-style: italic;">Note:<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">edll</span> has always been loading DLLs
with the <a
 href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/loadlibrary.asp">LoadLibrary()</a>
Win32 function. This is still the case and there is no worry there. It
will always work as expected.</td>
