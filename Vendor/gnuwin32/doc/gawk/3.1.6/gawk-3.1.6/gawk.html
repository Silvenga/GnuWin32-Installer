<h2 class="unnumbered">Foreword</h2>

<p>Arnold Robbins and I are good friends. We were introduced 11 years ago
by circumstances&mdash;and our favorite programming language, AWK. 
The circumstances started a couple of years
earlier. I was working at a new job and noticed an unplugged
Unix computer sitting in the corner.  No one knew how to use it,
and neither did I.  However,
a couple of days later it was running, and
I was <code>root</code> and the one-and-only user. 
That day, I began the transition from statistician to Unix programmer.

   <p>On one of many trips to the library or bookstore in search of
books on Unix, I found the gray AWK book, a.k.a. Aho, Kernighan and
Weinberger, <cite>The AWK Programming Language</cite>, Addison-Wesley,
1988.  AWK's simple programming paradigm&mdash;find a pattern in the
input and then perform an action&mdash;often reduced complex or tedious
data manipulations to few lines of code.  I was excited to try my
hand at programming in AWK.

   <p>Alas,  the <span class="command">awk</span> on my computer was a limited version of the
language described in the AWK book.  I discovered that my computer
had &ldquo;old <span class="command">awk</span>&rdquo; and the AWK book described &ldquo;new <span class="command">awk</span>.&rdquo;
I learned that this was typical; the old version refused to step
aside or relinquish its name.  If a system had a new <span class="command">awk</span>, it was
invariably called <span class="command">nawk</span>, and few systems had it. 
The best way to get a new <span class="command">awk</span> was to <span class="command">ftp</span> the source code for
<span class="command">gawk</span> from <code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  <span class="command">gawk</span> was a version of
new <span class="command">awk</span> written by David Trueman and Arnold, and available under
the GNU General Public License.

   <p>(Incidentally,
it's no longer difficult to find a new <span class="command">awk</span>. <span class="command">gawk</span> ships with
Linux, and you can download binaries or source code for almost
any system; my wife uses <span class="command">gawk</span> on her VMS box.)

   <p>My Unix system started out unplugged from the wall; it certainly was not
plugged into a network.  So, oblivious to the existence of <span class="command">gawk</span>
and the Unix community in general, and desiring a new <span class="command">awk</span>, I wrote
my own, called <span class="command">mawk</span>. 
Before I was finished I knew about <span class="command">gawk</span>,
but it was too late to stop, so I eventually posted
to a <code>comp.sources</code> newsgroup.

   <p>A few days after my posting, I got a friendly email
from Arnold introducing
himself.   He suggested we share design and algorithms and
attached a draft of the POSIX standard so
that I could update <span class="command">mawk</span> to support language extensions added
after publication of the AWK book.

   <p>Frankly, if our roles had
been reversed, I would not have been so open and we probably would
have never met.  I'm glad we did meet. 
He is an AWK expert's AWK expert and a genuinely nice person. 
Arnold contributes significant amounts of his
expertise and time to the Free Software Foundation.

   <p>This book is the <span class="command">gawk</span> reference manual, but at its core it
is a book about AWK programming that
will appeal to a wide audience. 
It is a definitive reference to the AWK language as defined by the
1987 Bell Labs release and codified in the 1992 POSIX Utilities
standard.

   <p>On the other hand, the novice AWK programmer can study
a wealth of practical programs that emphasize
the power of AWK's basic idioms:
data driven control-flow, pattern matching with regular expressions,
and associative arrays. 
Those looking for something new can try out <span class="command">gawk</span>'s
interface to network protocols via special <span class="file">/inet</span> files.

   <p>The programs in this book make clear that an AWK program is
typically much smaller and faster to develop than
a counterpart written in C. 
Consequently, there is often a payoff to prototype an
algorithm or design in AWK to get it running quickly and expose
problems early. Often, the interpreted performance is adequate
and the AWK prototype becomes the product.

   <p>The new <span class="command">pgawk</span> (profiling <span class="command">gawk</span>), produces
program execution counts. 
I recently experimented with an algorithm that for
n lines of input, exhibited
~ C n^2
performance, while
theory predicted
~ C n log n
behavior. A few minutes poring
over the <span class="file">awkprof.out</span> profile pinpointed the problem to
a single line of code.  <span class="command">pgawk</span> is a welcome addition to
my programmer's toolbox.

   <p>Arnold has distilled over a decade of experience writing and
using AWK programs, and developing <span class="command">gawk</span>, into this book.  If you use
AWK or want to learn how, then read this book.

<h2 class="unnumbered">Preface</h2>

<!-- I saw a comment somewhere that the preface should describe the book itself, -->
<!-- and the introduction should describe what the book covers. -->
<!-- 12/2000: Chuck wants the preface & intro combined. -->
<p>Several kinds of tasks occur repeatedly
when working with text files. 
You might want to extract certain lines and discard the rest. 
Or you may need to make changes wherever certain patterns appear,
but leave the rest of the file alone. 
Writing single-use programs for these tasks in languages such as C, C++, or Pascal
is time-consuming and inconvenient. 
Such jobs are often easier with <span class="command">awk</span>. 
The <span class="command">awk</span> utility interprets a special-purpose programming language
that makes it easy to handle simple data-reformatting jobs.

   <p>The GNU implementation of <span class="command">awk</span> is called <span class="command">gawk</span>; it is fully
compatible with the System V Release 4 version of
<span class="command">awk</span>.  <span class="command">gawk</span> is also compatible with the POSIX
specification of the <span class="command">awk</span> language.  This means that all
properly written <span class="command">awk</span> programs should work with <span class="command">gawk</span>. 
Thus, we usually don't distinguish between <span class="command">gawk</span> and other
<span class="command">awk</span> implementations.

Aho, Peter J. Weinberger and Brian W. Kernighan.  The original version of
<span class="command">awk</span> was written in 1977 at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. 
In 1985, a new version made the programming
language more powerful, introducing user-defined functions, multiple input
streams, and computed regular expressions. 
This new version became widely available with Unix System V
Release 3.1 (SVR3.1). 
The version in SVR4 added some new features and cleaned
up the behavior in some of the &ldquo;dark corners&rdquo; of the language. 
The specification for <span class="command">awk</span> in the POSIX Command Language
and Utilities standard further clarified the language. 
Both the <span class="command">gawk</span> designers and the original Bell Laboratories <span class="command">awk</span>
designers provided feedback for the POSIX specification.

Jay Fenlason completed it, with advice from Richard Stallman.  John Woods
contributed parts of the code as well.  In 1988 and 1989, David Trueman, with
help from me, thoroughly reworked <span class="command">gawk</span> for compatibility
with the newer <span class="command">awk</span>. 
Circa 1995, I became the primary maintainer. 
Current development focuses on bug fixes,
performance improvements, standards compliance, and occasionally, new features.

   <p>In May of 1997, J&uuml;rgen Kahrs felt the need for network access
from <span class="command">awk</span>, and with a little help from me, set about adding
features to do this for <span class="command">gawk</span>.  At that time, he also
wrote the bulk of
<cite>TCP/IP Internetworking with </cite><span class="command">gawk</span>
(a separate document, available as part of the <span class="command">gawk</span> distribution). 
His code finally became part of the main <span class="command">gawk</span> distribution
with <span class="command">gawk</span> version 3.1.

provided in <a href="#Language-History">Language History</a>. 
The language described in this Web page
is often referred to as &ldquo;new <span class="command">awk</span>&rdquo; (<span class="command">nawk</span>).

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-versions-of-21"></a>Because of this, many systems have multiple
versions of <span class="command">awk</span>. 
Some systems have an <span class="command">awk</span> utility that implements the
original version of the <span class="command">awk</span> language and a <span class="command">nawk</span> utility
for the new
version. 
Others have an <span class="command">oawk</span> version for the &ldquo;old <span class="command">awk</span>&rdquo;
language and plain <span class="command">awk</span> for the new one.  Still others only
have one version, which is usually the new one.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bnawk_007d-utility-22"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007boawk_007d-utility-23"></a>All in all, this makes it difficult for you to know which version of
<span class="command">awk</span> you should run when writing your programs.  The best advice
I can give here is to check your local documentation. Look for <span class="command">awk</span>,
<span class="command">oawk</span>, and <span class="command">nawk</span>, as well as for <span class="command">gawk</span>. 
It is likely that you already
have some version of new <span class="command">awk</span> on your system, which is what
you should use when running your programs.  (Of course, if you're reading
this Web page, chances are good that you have <span class="command">gawk</span>!)

   <p>Throughout this Web page, whenever we refer to a language feature
that should be available in any complete implementation of POSIX <span class="command">awk</span>,
we simply use the term <span class="command">awk</span>.  When referring to a feature that is
specific to the GNU implementation, we use the term <span class="command">gawk</span>.

<h3 class="section">Using This Book</h3>

<p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-terms-describing-24"></a>
The term <span class="command">awk</span> refers to a particular program as well as to the language you
use to tell this program what to do.  When we need to be careful, we call
the language &ldquo;the <span class="command">awk</span> language,&rdquo;
and the program &ldquo;the <span class="command">awk</span> utility.&rdquo;
This Web page explains
both the <span class="command">awk</span> language and how to run the <span class="command">awk</span> utility. 
The term <span class="command">awk</span><dfn> program</dfn> refers to a program written by you in
the <span class="command">awk</span> programming language.

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-25"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-and-26"></a><a name="index-POSIX-_0040command_007bawk_007d-27"></a>Primarily, this Web page explains the features of <span class="command">awk</span>,
as defined in the POSIX standard.  It does so in the context of the
<span class="command">gawk</span> implementation.  While doing so, it also
attempts to describe important differences between <span class="command">gawk</span>
and other <span class="command">awk</span> implementations.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>
Finally, any <span class="command">gawk</span> features that are not in
the POSIX standard for <span class="command">awk</span> are noted.

   <p>This Web page has the difficult task of being both a tutorial and a reference. 
If you are a novice, feel free to skip over details that seem too complex. 
You should also ignore the many cross-references; they are for the
expert user and for the online Info version of the document.

   <p>There are
subsections labelled
as <strong>Advanced Notes</strong>
scattered throughout the Web page. 
They add a more complete explanation of points that are relevant, but not likely
to be of interest on first reading. 
All appear in the index, under the heading &ldquo;advanced features.&rdquo;

   <p>Most of the time, the examples use complete <span class="command">awk</span> programs. 
In some of the more advanced sections, only the part of the <span class="command">awk</span>
program that illustrates the concept currently being described is shown.

   <p>While this Web page is aimed principally at people who have not been
exposed
to <span class="command">awk</span>, there is a lot of information here that even the <span class="command">awk</span>
expert should find useful.  In particular, the description of POSIX
<span class="command">awk</span> and the example programs in
<a href="#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>, and in
<a href="#Sample-Programs">Sample Programs</a>,
should be of interest.

   <p><a href="#Getting-Started">Getting Started</a>,
provides the essentials you need to know to begin using <span class="command">awk</span>.

   <p><a href="#Regexp">Regexp</a>,
introduces regular expressions in general, and in particular the flavors
supported by POSIX <span class="command">awk</span> and <span class="command">gawk</span>.

   <p><a href="#Reading-Files">Reading Files</a>,
describes how <span class="command">awk</span> reads your data. 
It introduces the concepts of records and fields, as well
as the <code>getline</code> command. 
I/O redirection is first described here.

   <p><a href="#Printing">Printing</a>,
describes how <span class="command">awk</span> programs can produce output with
<code>print</code> and <code>printf</code>.

   <p><a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>,
describes expressions, which are the basic building blocks
for getting most things done in a program.

   <p><a href="#Patterns-and-Actions">Patterns and Actions</a>,
describes how to write patterns for matching records, actions for
doing something when a record is matched, and the built-in variables
<span class="command">awk</span> and <span class="command">gawk</span> use.

   <p><a href="#Arrays">Arrays</a>,
covers <span class="command">awk</span>'s one-and-only data structure: associative arrays. 
Deleting array elements and whole arrays is also described, as well as
sorting arrays in <span class="command">gawk</span>.

   <p><a href="#Functions">Functions</a>,
describes the built-in functions <span class="command">awk</span> and
<span class="command">gawk</span> provide, as well as how to define
your own functions.

   <p><a href="#Internationalization">Internationalization</a>,
describes special features in <span class="command">gawk</span> for translating program
messages into different languages at runtime.

   <p><a href="#Advanced-Features">Advanced Features</a>,
describes a number of <span class="command">gawk</span>-specific advanced features. 
Of particular note
are the abilities to have two-way communications with another process,
perform TCP/IP networking, and
profile your <span class="command">awk</span> programs.

   <p><a href="#Invoking-Gawk">Invoking Gawk</a>,
describes how to run <span class="command">gawk</span>, the meaning of its
command-line options, and how it finds <span class="command">awk</span>
program source files.

   <p><a href="#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>, and
<a href="#Sample-Programs">Sample Programs</a>,
provide many sample <span class="command">awk</span> programs. 
Reading them allows you to see <span class="command">awk</span>
solving real problems.

   <p><a href="#Language-History">Language History</a>,
describes how the <span class="command">awk</span> language has evolved since
first release to present.  It also describes how <span class="command">gawk</span>
has acquired features over time.

   <p><a href="#Installation">Installation</a>,
describes how to get <span class="command">gawk</span>, how to compile it
under Unix, and how to compile and use it on different
non-Unix systems.  It also describes how to report bugs
in <span class="command">gawk</span> and where to get three other freely
available implementations of <span class="command">awk</span>.

   <p><a href="#Notes">Notes</a>,
describes how to disable <span class="command">gawk</span>'s extensions, as
well as how to contribute new code to <span class="command">gawk</span>,
how to write extension libraries, and some possible
future directions for <span class="command">gawk</span> development.

   <p><a href="#Basic-Concepts">Basic Concepts</a>,
provides some very cursory background material for those who
are completely unfamiliar with computer programming. 
Also centralized there is a discussion of some of the issues
surrounding floating-point numbers.

   <p>The
<a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a>,
defines most, if not all, the significant terms used
throughout the book. 
If you find terms that you aren't familiar with, try looking them up here.

   <p><a href="#Copying">Copying</a>, and
<a href="#GNU-Free-Documentation-License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>,
present the licenses that cover the <span class="command">gawk</span> source code
and this Web page, respectively.

<h3 class="section">Typographical Conventions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Texinfo-28"></a>This Web page is written using Texinfo, the GNU documentation
formatting language. 
A single Texinfo source file is used to produce both the printed and online
versions of the documentation. 
Because of this, the typographical conventions
are slightly different than in other books you may have read.

   <p>Examples you would type at the command-line are preceded by the common
shell primary and secondary prompts, <span class="samp">$</span> and <span class="samp">&gt;</span>. 
Output from the command is preceded by the glyph &ldquo;-|&rdquo;. 
This typically represents the command's standard output. 
Error messages, and other output on the command's standard error, are preceded
by the glyph &ldquo;error--&gt;&rdquo;.  For example:

<pre class="example">     $ echo hi on stdout
     -| hi on stdout
     $ echo hello on stderr 1&gt;&amp;2
     error--&gt; hello on stderr
</pre>
   <p>In the text, command names appear in <code>this font</code>, while code segments
appear in the same font and quoted, <span class="samp">like this</span>.  Some things are
emphasized <em>like this</em>, and if a point needs to be made
strongly, it is done <strong>like this</strong>.  The first occurrence of
a new term is usually its <dfn>definition</dfn> and appears in the same
font as the previous occurrence of &ldquo;definition&rdquo; in this sentence. 
file names are indicated like this: <span class="file">/path/to/ourfile</span>.

   <p>Characters that you type at the keyboard look <kbd>like this</kbd>.  In particular,
there are special characters called &ldquo;control characters.&rdquo;  These are
characters that you type by holding down both the <kbd>CONTROL</kbd> key and
another key, at the same time.  For example, a <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd> is typed
by first pressing and holding the <kbd>CONTROL</kbd> key, next
pressing the <kbd>d</kbd> key and finally releasing both keys.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Dark Corners</h5>

<p><a name="index-Kernighan_002c-Brian-29"></a><blockquote>
<i>Dark corners are basically fractal &mdash; no matter how much
you illuminate, there's always a smaller but darker one.</i><br>
Brian Kernighan
</blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-d_002ec_002e_002c-See-dark-corner-30"></a><a name="index-dark-corner-31"></a>Until the POSIX standard (and <cite>The Gawk Manual</cite>),
many features of <span class="command">awk</span> were either poorly documented or not
documented at all.  Descriptions of such features
(often called &ldquo;dark corners&rdquo;) are noted in this Web page with
&ldquo;(d.c.)&rdquo;. 
They also appear in the index under the heading &ldquo;dark corner.&rdquo;

   <p>As noted by the opening quote, though, any
coverage of dark corners
is, by definition, something that is incomplete.

to the production and distribution of freely distributable software. 
It was founded by Richard M. Stallman, the author of the original
Emacs editor.  GNU Emacs is the most widely used version of Emacs today.

   <p><a name="index-GNU-Project-35"></a><a name="index-GPL-_0028General-Public-License_0029-36"></a><a name="index-General-Public-License_002c-See-GPL-37"></a><a name="index-documentation_002c-online-38"></a>The GNU<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>
Project is an ongoing effort on the part of the Free Software
Foundation to create a complete, freely distributable, POSIX-compliant
computing environment. 
The FSF uses the &ldquo;GNU General Public License&rdquo; (GPL) to ensure that
their software's
source code is always available to the end user. A
copy of the GPL is included
in this Web page
for your reference
(see <a href="#Copying">Copying</a>). 
The GPL applies to the C language source code for <span class="command">gawk</span>. 
To find out more about the FSF and the GNU Project online,
see <a href="http://www.gnu.org">the GNU Project's home page</a>. 
This Web page may also be read from
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/">their web site</a>.

   <p>A shell, an editor (Emacs), highly portable optimizing C, C++, and
Objective-C compilers, a symbolic debugger and dozens of large and
small utilities (such as <span class="command">gawk</span>), have all been completed and are
freely available.  The GNU operating
system kernel (the HURD), has been released but is still in an early
stage of development.

   <p><a name="index-Linux-39"></a><a name="index-GNU_002fLinux-40"></a><a name="index-operating-systems_002c-BSD_002dbased-41"></a><a name="index-Alpha-_0028DEC_0029-42"></a>Until the GNU operating system is more fully developed, you should
consider using GNU/Linux, a freely distributable, Unix-like operating
system for Intel 80386, DEC Alpha, Sun SPARC, IBM S/390, and other
systems.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>
There are
many books on GNU/Linux. One that is freely available is <cite>Linux
Installation and Getting Started</cite>, by Matt Welsh. 
Many GNU/Linux distributions are often available in computer stores or
bundled on CD-ROMs with books about Linux. 
(There are three other freely available, Unix-like operating systems for
80386 and other systems: NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. All are based on the
4.4-Lite Berkeley Software Distribution, and they use recent versions
of <span class="command">gawk</span> for their versions of <span class="command">awk</span>.)

   <p>The Web page you are reading is actually free&mdash;at least, the
information in it is free to anyone.  The machine-readable
source code for the Web page comes with <span class="command">gawk</span>; anyone
may take this Web page to a copying machine and make as many
copies as they like.  (Take a moment to check the Free Documentation
License in <a href="#GNU-Free-Documentation-License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.)

   <p>Although you could just print it out yourself, bound books are much
easier to read and use.  Furthermore,
the proceeds from sales of this book go back to the FSF
to help fund development of more free software.

   <p><a name="index-Close_002c-Diane-43"></a>The Web page itself has gone through a number of previous editions. 
Paul Rubin wrote the very first draft of <cite>The GAWK Manual</cite>;
it was around 40 pages in size. 
Diane Close and Richard Stallman improved it, yielding a
version that was
around 90 pages long and barely described the original, &ldquo;old&rdquo;
version of <span class="command">awk</span>.

   <p>I started working with that version in the fall of 1988. 
As work on it progressed,
the FSF published several preliminary versions (numbered 0.<var>x</var>). 
In 1996, Edition 1.0 was released with <span class="command">gawk</span> 3.0.0. 
The FSF published the first two editions under
the title <cite>The GNU Awk User's Guide</cite>.

   <p>This edition maintains the basic structure of Edition 1.0,
but with significant additional material, reflecting the host of new features
in <span class="command">gawk</span> version 3.1.

<p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-function-of-72"></a>
The basic function of <span class="command">awk</span> is to search files for lines (or other
units of text) that contain certain patterns.  When a line matches one
of the patterns, <span class="command">awk</span> performs specified actions on that line. 
<span class="command">awk</span> keeps processing input lines in this way until it reaches
the end of the input files.

because <span class="command">awk</span> programs are <dfn>data-driven</dfn>; that is, you describe
the data you want to work with and then what to do when you find it. 
Most other languages are <dfn>procedural</dfn>; you have to describe, in great
detail, every step the program is to take.  When working with procedural
languages, it is usually much
harder to clearly describe the data your program will process. 
For this reason, <span class="command">awk</span> programs are often refreshingly easy to
read and write.

   <p><a name="index-program_002c-definition-of-76"></a><a name="index-rule_002c-definition-of-77"></a>When you run <span class="command">awk</span>, you specify an <span class="command">awk</span> <dfn>program</dfn> that
tells <span class="command">awk</span> what to do.  The program consists of a series of
<dfn>rules</dfn>.  (It may also contain <dfn>function definitions</dfn>,
an advanced feature that we will ignore for now. 
See <a href="#User_002ddefined">User-defined</a>.)  Each rule specifies one
pattern to search for and one action to perform
upon finding the pattern.

   <p>Syntactically, a rule consists of a pattern followed by an action.  The
action is enclosed in curly braces to separate it from the pattern. 
Newlines usually separate rules.  Therefore, an <span class="command">awk</span>
program looks like this:

<pre class="example">     <var>pattern</var> { <var>action</var> }
     <var>pattern</var> { <var>action</var> }

<h3 class="section">1.1 How to Run <span class="command">awk</span> Programs</h3>

<p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-running-78"></a>There are several ways to run an <span class="command">awk</span> program.  If the program is
short, it is easiest to include it in the command that runs <span class="command">awk</span>,
like this:

<pre class="example">     awk '<var>program</var>' <var>input-file1</var> <var>input-file2</var> ...
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-command-line_002c-formats-79"></a>When the program is long, it is usually more convenient to put it in a file
and run it with a command like this:

<pre class="example">     awk -f <var>program-file</var> <var>input-file1</var> <var>input-file2</var> ...
</pre>
   <p>This section discusses both mechanisms, along with several
variations of each.

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.1 One-Shot Throwaway <span class="command">awk</span> Programs</h4>

<p>Once you are familiar with <span class="command">awk</span>, you will often type in simple
programs the moment you want to use them.  Then you can write the
program as the first argument of the <span class="command">awk</span> command, like this:

<pre class="example">     awk '<var>program</var>' <var>input-file1</var> <var>input-file2</var> ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>program</var> consists of a series of <var>patterns</var> and
<var>actions</var>, as described earlier.

   <p><a name="index-single-quote-_0028_0040code_007b_0027_007d_0029-80"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0027_007d-_0028single-quote_0029-81"></a>This command format instructs the <dfn>shell</dfn>, or command interpreter,
to start <span class="command">awk</span> and use the <var>program</var> to process records in the
input file(s).  There are single quotes around <var>program</var> so
the shell won't interpret any <span class="command">awk</span> characters as special shell
characters.  The quotes also cause the shell to treat all of <var>program</var> as
a single argument for <span class="command">awk</span>, and allow <var>program</var> to be more
than one line long.

   <p><a name="index-shells_002c-scripts-82"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-running_002c-from-shell-scripts-83"></a>This format is also useful for running short or medium-sized <span class="command">awk</span>
programs from shell scripts, because it avoids the need for a separate
file for the <span class="command">awk</span> program.  A self-contained shell script is more
reliable because there are no other files to misplace.

following command line:

<pre class="example">     awk '<var>program</var>'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><span class="command">awk</span> applies the <var>program</var> to the <dfn>standard input</dfn>,
which usually means whatever you type on the terminal.  This continues
until you indicate end-of-file by typing <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd>. 
(On other operating systems, the end-of-file character may be different. 
For example, on OS/2 and MS-DOS, it is <kbd>Ctrl-z</kbd>.)

   <p><a name="index-files_002c-input_002c-See-input-files-87"></a><a name="index-input-files_002c-running-_0040command_007bawk_007d-without-88"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-running_002c-without-input-files-89"></a>As an example, the following program prints a friendly piece of advice
(from Douglas Adams's <cite>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</cite>),
to keep you from worrying about the complexities of computer programming
(<code>BEGIN</code> is a feature we haven't discussed yet):

<pre class="example">     $ awk "BEGIN { print \"Don't Panic!\" }"
     -| Don't Panic!

The <span class="samp">\</span> before each of the
inner double quotes is necessary because of the shell's quoting
rules&mdash;in particular because it mixes both single quotes and
double quotes.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a>

   <p>This next simple <span class="command">awk</span> program

In this case, it is
more convenient to put the program into a separate file.  In order to tell
<span class="command">awk</span> to use that file for its program, you type:

<pre class="example">     awk -f <var>source-file</var> <var>input-file1</var> <var>input-file2</var> ...
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002df_007d-option-98"></a><a name="index-command-line_002c-options-99"></a><a name="index-options_002c-command_002dline-100"></a>The <span class="option">-f</span> instructs the <span class="command">awk</span> utility to get the <span class="command">awk</span> program
from the file <var>source-file</var>.  Any file name can be used for
<var>source-file</var>.  For example, you could put the program:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN { print "Don't Panic!" }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">into the file <span class="file">advice</span>.  Then this command:

<pre class="example">     awk -f advice
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">does the same thing as this one:

<pre class="example">     awk "BEGIN { print \"Don't Panic!\" }"
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-quoting-101"></a>This was explained earlier
(see <a href="#Read-Terminal">Read Terminal</a>). 
Note that you don't usually need single quotes around the file name that you
specify with <span class="option">-f</span>, because most file names don't contain any of the shell's
special characters.  Notice that in <span class="file">advice</span>, the <span class="command">awk</span>
program did not have single quotes around it.  The quotes are only needed
for programs that are provided on the <span class="command">awk</span> command line.

you can add the extension <span class="file">.awk</span> to the file name.  This doesn't
affect the execution of the <span class="command">awk</span> program but it does make
&ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; easier.

Once you have learned <span class="command">awk</span>, you may want to write self-contained
<span class="command">awk</span> scripts, using the <span class="samp">#!</span> script mechanism.  You can do
this on many Unix systems<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-7" name="fnd-7"><sup>7</sup></a> as well as on the GNU system. 
For example, you could update the file <span class="file">advice</span> to look like this:

<pre class="example">     #! /bin/awk -f
     
     BEGIN { print "Don't Panic!" }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After making this file executable (with the <span class="command">chmod</span> utility),
simply type <span class="samp">advice</span>
at the shell and the system arranges to run <span class="command">awk</span><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-8" name="fnd-8"><sup>8</sup></a> as if you had
typed <span class="samp">awk -f advice</span>:

<pre class="example">     $ chmod +x advice
     $ advice
     -| Don't Panic!
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(We assume you have the current directory in your shell's search
path variable (typically <code>$PATH</code>).  If not, you may need
to type <span class="samp">./advice</span> at the shell.)

   <p>Self-contained <span class="command">awk</span> scripts are useful when you want to write a
program that users can invoke without their having to know that the program is
written in <span class="command">awk</span>.

<!-- fakenode - for prepinfo -->
<h4 class="subheading">Advanced Notes: Portability Issues with <span class="samp">#!</span></h4>

<p><a name="index-portability_002c-_0040code_007b_0023_0021_007d-_0028executable-scripts_0029-110"></a>
Some systems limit the length of the interpreter name to 32 characters. 
Often, this can be dealt with by using a symbolic link.

   <p>You should not put more than one argument on the <span class="samp">#!</span>
line after the path to <span class="command">awk</span>. It does not work. The operating system
treats the rest of the line as a single argument and passes it to <span class="command">awk</span>. 
Doing this leads to confusing behavior&mdash;most likely a usage diagnostic
of some sort from <span class="command">awk</span>.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bARGC_007d_002f_0040code_007bARGV_007d-variables_002c-portability-and-111"></a><a name="index-portability_002c-_0040code_007bARGV_007d-variable-112"></a>Finally,
the value of <code>ARGV[0]</code>
(see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>)
varies depending upon your operating system. 
Some systems put <span class="samp">awk</span> there, some put the full pathname

A <dfn>comment</dfn> is some text that is included in a program for the sake
of human readers; it is not really an executable part of the program.  Comments
can explain what the program does and how it works.  Nearly all
programming languages have provisions for comments, as programs are
typically hard to understand without them.

   <p>In the <span class="command">awk</span> language, a comment starts with the sharp sign
character (<span class="samp">#</span>) and continues to the end of the line. 
The <span class="samp">#</span> does not have to be the first character on the line. The
<span class="command">awk</span> language ignores the rest of a line following a sharp sign. 
For example, we could have put the following into <span class="file">advice</span>:

<pre class="example">     # This program prints a nice friendly message.  It helps
     # keep novice users from being afraid of the computer.
     BEGIN    { print "Don't Panic!" }
</pre>
   <p>You can put comment lines into keyboard-composed throwaway <span class="command">awk</span>
programs, but this usually isn't very useful; the purpose of a
comment is to help you or another person understand the program
when reading it at a later time.

   <p><a name="index-quoting-117"></a><a name="index-single-quote-_0028_0040code_007b_0027_007d_0029_002c-vs_002e_0040_003a-apostrophe-118"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0027_007d-_0028single-quote_0029_002c-vs_002e_0040_003a-apostrophe-119"></a><strong>Caution:</strong> As mentioned in
<a href="#One_002dshot">One-shot</a>,
you can enclose small to medium programs in single quotes, in order to keep
your shell scripts self-contained.  When doing so, <em>don't</em> put
an apostrophe (i.e., a single quote) into a comment (or anywhere else
in your program). The shell interprets the quote as the closing
quote for the entire program. As a result, usually the shell
prints a message about mismatched quotes, and if <span class="command">awk</span> actually
runs, it will probably print strange messages about syntax errors. 
For example, look at the following:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ print "hello" } # let's be cute'
     &gt;
</pre>
   <p>The shell sees that the first two quotes match, and that
a new quoted object begins at the end of the command line. 
It therefore prompts with the secondary prompt, waiting for more input. 
With Unix <span class="command">awk</span>, closing the quoted string produces this result:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ print "hello" } # let's be cute'
     &gt; '
     error--&gt; awk: can't open file be
     error--&gt;  source line number 1

since backslashes are not special inside single quotes.

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.6 Shell-Quoting Issues</h4>

<p><a name="index-quoting_002c-rules-for-122"></a>
For short to medium length <span class="command">awk</span> programs, it is most convenient
to enter the program on the <span class="command">awk</span> command line. 
This is best done by enclosing the entire program in single quotes. 
This is true whether you are entering the program interactively at
the shell prompt, or writing it as part of a larger shell script:

   <p><a name="index-shells_002c-quoting_002c-rules-for-123"></a><a name="index-Bourne-shell_002c-quoting-rules-for-124"></a>Once you are working with the shell, it is helpful to have a basic
knowledge of shell quoting rules.  The following rules apply only to
POSIX-compliant, Bourne-style shells (such as <span class="command">bash</span>, the GNU Bourne-Again
Shell).  If you use <span class="command">csh</span>, you're on your own.

     <ul>
<li>Quoted items can be concatenated with nonquoted items as well as with other
quoted items.  The shell turns everything into one argument for
the command.

     <li>Preceding any single character with a backslash (<span class="samp">\</span>) quotes
that character.  The shell removes the backslash and passes the quoted
character on to the command.

     <li><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005c_007d-_0028backslash_0029-125"></a><a name="index-backslash-_0028_0040code_007b_005c_007d_0029-126"></a><a name="index-single-quote-_0028_0040code_007b_0027_007d_0029-127"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0027_007d-_0028single-quote_0029-128"></a>Single quotes protect everything between the opening and closing quotes. 
The shell does no interpretation of the quoted text, passing it on verbatim
to the command. 
It is <em>impossible</em> to embed a single quote inside single-quoted text. 
Refer back to
<a href="#Comments">Comments</a>,
for an example of what happens if you try.

     <li><a name="index-double-quote-_0028_0040code_007b_0022_007d_0029-129"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0022_007d-_0028double-quote_0029-130"></a>Double quotes protect most things between the opening and closing quotes. 
The shell does at least variable and command substitution on the quoted text. 
Different shells may do additional kinds of processing on double-quoted text.

     <p>Since certain characters within double-quoted text are processed by the shell,
they must be <dfn>escaped</dfn> within the text.  Of note are the characters
<span class="samp">$</span>, <span class="samp">`</span>, <span class="samp">\</span>, and <span class="samp">"</span>, all of which must be preceded by
a backslash within double-quoted text if they are to be passed on literally
to the program.  (The leading backslash is stripped first.) 
Thus, the example seen
previously
in <a href="#Read-Terminal">Read Terminal</a>,
is applicable:

     <pre class="example">          $ awk "BEGIN { print \"Don't Panic!\" }"
          -| Don't Panic!
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-single-quote-_0028_0040code_007b_0027_007d_0029_002c-with-double-quotes-131"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0027_007d-_0028single-quote_0029_002c-with-double-quotes-132"></a>Note that the single quote is not special within double quotes.

     <li>Null strings are removed when they occur as part of a non-null
command-line argument, while explicit non-null objects are kept. 
For example, to specify that the field separator <code>FS</code> should
be set to the null string, use:

     <pre class="example">          awk -F "" '<var>program</var>' <var>files</var> # correct
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent"><a name="index-null-strings_002c-quoting-and-133"></a>Don't use this:

     <pre class="example">          awk -F"" '<var>program</var>' <var>files</var>  # wrong!
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">In the second case, <span class="command">awk</span> will attempt to use the text of the program
as the value of <code>FS</code>, and the first file name as the text of the program! 
This results in syntax errors at best, and confusing behavior at worst. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-quoting_002c-tricks-for-134"></a>Mixing single and double quotes is difficult.  You have to resort
to shell quoting tricks, like this:

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN { print "Here is a single quote &lt;'"'"'&gt;" }'
     -| Here is a single quote &lt;'&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This program consists of three concatenated quoted strings.  The first and the
third are single-quoted, the second is double-quoted.

   <p>This can be &ldquo;simplified&rdquo; to:

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN { print "Here is a single quote &lt;'\''&gt;" }'
     -| Here is a single quote &lt;'&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Judge for yourself which of these two is the more readable.

   <p>Another option is to use double quotes, escaping the embedded, <span class="command">awk</span>-level
double quotes:

<pre class="example">     $ awk "BEGIN { print \"Here is a single quote &lt;'&gt;\" }"
     -| Here is a single quote &lt;'&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><!-- ENDOFRANGE sq1x -->
<!-- ENDOFRANGE qs2x -->
This option is also painful, because double quotes, backslashes, and dollar signs
are very common in <span class="command">awk</span> programs.

   <p>A third option is to use the octal escape sequence equivalents for the
single- and double-quote characters, like so:

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN { print "Here is a single quote &lt;\47&gt;" }'
     -| Here is a single quote &lt;'&gt;
     $ awk 'BEGIN { print "Here is a double quote &lt;\42&gt;" }'
     -| Here is a double quote &lt;"&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This works nicely, except that you should comment clearly what the
escapes mean.

   <p>A fourth option is to use command-line variable assignment, like this:

<pre class="example">     $ awk -v sq="'" 'BEGIN { print "Here is a single quote &lt;" sq "&gt;" }'
     -| Here is a single quote &lt;'&gt;
</pre>
   <p>If you really need both single and double quotes in your <span class="command">awk</span>
program, it is probably best to move it into a separate file, where
the shell won't be part of the picture, and you can say what you mean.

The second data file, called <span class="file">inventory-shipped</span>, contains

   <p>In the data file <span class="file">BBS-list</span>, each record contains the name of a computer
bulletin board, its phone number, the board's baud rate(s), and a code for
the number of hours it is operational.  An <span class="samp">A</span> in the last column
means the board operates 24 hours a day.  A <span class="samp">B</span> in the last
column means the board only operates on evening and weekend hours. 
A <span class="samp">C</span> means the board operates only on weekends:

<h3 class="section">1.3 Some Simple Examples</h3>

<p>The following command runs a simple <span class="command">awk</span> program that searches the
input file <span class="file">BBS-list</span> for the character string <span class="samp">foo</span> (a
grouping of characters is usually called a <dfn>string</dfn>;
the term <dfn>string</dfn> is based on similar usage in English, such
as &ldquo;a string of pearls,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a string of cars in a train&rdquo;):

<pre class="example">     awk '/foo/ { print $0 }' BBS-list
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When lines containing <span class="samp">foo</span> are found, they are printed because
<span class="samp">print&nbsp;$0</span><!-- /@w --> means print the current line.  (Just <span class="samp">print</span> by
itself means the same thing, so we could have written that
instead.)

   <p>You will notice that slashes (<span class="samp">/</span>) surround the string <span class="samp">foo</span>
in the <span class="command">awk</span> program.  The slashes indicate that <span class="samp">foo</span>
is the pattern to search for.  This type of pattern is called a
<dfn>regular expression</dfn>, which is covered in more detail later
(see <a href="#Regexp">Regexp</a>). 
The pattern is allowed to match parts of words. 
There are
single quotes around the <span class="command">awk</span> program so that the shell won't
interpret any of it as special shell characters.

   <p>Here is what this program prints:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '/foo/ { print $0 }' BBS-list
     -| fooey        555-1234     2400/1200/300     B
     -| foot         555-6699     1200/300          B
     -| macfoo       555-6480     1200/300          A
     -| sabafoo      555-2127     1200/300          C
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-actions_002c-default-138"></a><a name="index-patterns_002c-default-139"></a>In an <span class="command">awk</span> rule, either the pattern or the action can be omitted,
but not both.  If the pattern is omitted, then the action is performed
for <em>every</em> input line.  If the action is omitted, the default
action is to print all lines that match the pattern.

   <p><a name="index-actions_002c-empty-140"></a>Thus, we could leave out the action (the <code>print</code> statement and the curly
braces) in the previous example and the result would be the same: all
lines matching the pattern <span class="samp">foo</span> are printed.  By comparison,
omitting the <code>print</code> statement but retaining the curly braces makes an
empty action that does nothing (i.e., no lines are printed).

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-one_002dline-examples-141"></a>Many practical <span class="command">awk</span> programs are just a line or two.  Following is a
collection of useful, short programs to get you started.  Some of these
programs contain constructs that haven't been covered yet. (The description
of the program will give you a good idea of what is going on, but please
read the rest of the Web page to become an <span class="command">awk</span> expert!) 
Most of the examples use a data file named <span class="file">data</span>.  This is just a
placeholder; if you use these programs yourself, substitute
your own file names for <span class="file">data</span>. 
For future reference, note that there is often more than
one way to do things in <span class="command">awk</span>.  At some point, you may want
to look back at these examples and see if
you can come up with different ways to do the same things shown here:

     <ul>
<li>Print the length of the longest input line:

     <pre class="example">          awk '{ if (length($0) &gt; max) max = length($0) }
               END { print max }' data
     </pre>
     <li>Print every line that is longer than 80 characters:

     <pre class="example">          awk 'length($0) &gt; 80' data
     </pre>
     <p>The sole rule has a relational expression as its pattern and it has no
action&mdash;so the default action, printing the record, is used.

     <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bexpand_007d-utility-142"></a><li>Print the length of the longest line in <span class="file">data</span>:

     <pre class="example">          expand data | awk '{ if (x &lt; length()) x = length() }
                        END { print "maximum line length is " x }'
     </pre>
     <p>The input is processed by the <span class="command">expand</span> utility to change tabs
into spaces, so the widths compared are actually the right-margin columns.

     <li>Print every line that has at least one field:

     <pre class="example">          awk 'NF &gt; 0' data
     </pre>
     <p>This is an easy way to delete blank lines from a file (or rather, to
create a new file similar to the old file but from which the blank lines
have been removed).

     <li>Print seven random numbers from 0 to 100, inclusive:

     <pre class="example">          awk 'BEGIN { for (i = 1; i &lt;= 7; i++)
                           print int(101 * rand()) }'
     </pre>
     <li>Print the total number of bytes used by <var>files</var>:

     <pre class="example">          ls -l <var>files</var> | awk '{ x += $5 }
                            END { print "total bytes: " x }'
     </pre>
     <li>Print the total number of kilobytes used by <var>files</var>:

     <!-- Don't use \ continuation, not discussed yet -->
<pre class="example">          ls -l <var>files</var> | awk '{ x += $5 }
             END { print "total K-bytes: " (x + 1023)/1024 }'
     </pre>
     <li>Print a sorted list of the login names of all users:

     <pre class="example">          awk -F: '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd | sort
     </pre>
     <li>Count the lines in a file:

     <pre class="example">          awk 'END { print NR }' data
     </pre>
     <li>Print the even-numbered lines in the data file:

     <pre class="example">          awk 'NR % 2 == 0' data
     </pre>
     <p>If you use the expression <span class="samp">NR % 2 == 1</span> instead,
the program would print the odd-numbered lines. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">1.4 An Example with Two Rules</h3>

<p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs-143"></a>
The <span class="command">awk</span> utility reads the input files one line at a
time.  For each line, <span class="command">awk</span> tries the patterns of each of the rules. 
If several patterns match, then several actions are run in the order in
which they appear in the <span class="command">awk</span> program.  If no patterns match, then
no actions are run.

   <p>After processing all the rules that match the line (and perhaps there are none),
<span class="command">awk</span> reads the next line.  (However,
see <a href="#Next-Statement">Next Statement</a>,
and also see <a href="#Nextfile-Statement">Nextfile Statement</a>). 
This continues until the program reaches the end of the file. 
For example, the following <span class="command">awk</span> program contains two rules:

<pre class="example">     /12/  { print $0 }
     /21/  { print $0 }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first rule has the string <span class="samp">12</span> as the
pattern and <span class="samp">print $0</span> as the action.  The second rule has the
string <span class="samp">21</span> as the pattern and also has <span class="samp">print $0</span> as the
action.  Each rule's action is enclosed in its own pair of braces.

   <p>This program prints every line that contains the string
<span class="samp">12</span> <em>or</em> the string <span class="samp">21</span>.  If a line contains both
strings, it is printed twice, once by each rule.

   <p>This is what happens if we run this program on our two sample data files,
<span class="file">BBS-list</span> and <span class="file">inventory-shipped</span>:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '/12/ { print $0 }
     &gt;      /21/ { print $0 }' BBS-list inventory-shipped

<p>Now that we've mastered some simple tasks, let's look at

features that haven't been covered yet, so don't worry if you don't
understand all the details:

you a listing of the files in a directory, including each file's size and the date
the file was last modified. Its output looks like this:

<!-- @cindex automatic initialization -->
<p><a name="index-initialization_002c-automatic-149"></a>The <span class="samp">$6 == "Nov"</span> in our <span class="command">awk</span> program is an expression that
tests whether the sixth field of the output from <span class="samp">ls&nbsp;-l</span><!-- /@w -->
matches the string <span class="samp">Nov</span>.  Each time a line has the string
<span class="samp">Nov</span> for its sixth field, the action <span class="samp">sum += $5</span> is
performed.  This adds the fifth field (the file's size) to the variable
<code>sum</code>.  As a result, when <span class="command">awk</span> has finished reading all the
input lines, <code>sum</code> is the total of the sizes of the files whose
lines matched the pattern.  (This works because <span class="command">awk</span> variables
are automatically initialized to zero.)

   <p>After the last line of output from <span class="command">ls</span> has been processed, the
<code>END</code> rule executes and prints the value of <code>sum</code>. 
In this example, the value of <code>sum</code> is 80600.

   <p>These more advanced <span class="command">awk</span> techniques are covered in later sections
(see <a href="#Action-Overview">Action Overview</a>).  Before you can move on to more
advanced <span class="command">awk</span> programming, you have to know how <span class="command">awk</span> interprets
your input and displays your output.  By manipulating fields and using
<code>print</code> statements, you can produce some very useful and
impressive-looking reports.

<h3 class="section">1.6 <span class="command">awk</span> Statements Versus Lines</h3>

<p><a name="index-line-breaks-150"></a><a name="index-newlines-151"></a>
Most often, each line in an <span class="command">awk</span> program is a separate statement or
separate rule, like this:

<pre class="example">     awk '/12/  { print $0 }
          /21/  { print $0 }' BBS-list inventory-shipped
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-newlines-in-152"></a>However, <span class="command">gawk</span> ignores newlines after any of the following
symbols and keywords:

<pre class="example">     ,    {    ?    :    ||    &amp;&amp;    do    else
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">A newline at any other point is considered the end of the
statement.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-11" name="fnd-11"><sup>11</sup></a>

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005c_007d-_0028backslash_0029_002c-continuing-lines-and-153"></a><a name="index-backslash-_0028_0040code_007b_005c_007d_0029_002c-continuing-lines-and-154"></a>If you would like to split a single statement into two lines at a point
where a newline would terminate it, you can <dfn>continue</dfn> it by ending the
first line with a backslash character (<span class="samp">\</span>).  The backslash must be
the final character on the line in order to be recognized as a continuation
character.  A backslash is allowed anywhere in the statement, even
in the middle of a string or regular expression.  For example:

<pre class="example">     awk '/This regular expression is too long, so continue it\
      on the next line/ { print $1 }'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-portability_002c-backslash-continuation-and-155"></a>We have generally not used backslash continuation in the sample programs
in this Web page.  In <span class="command">gawk</span>, there is no limit on the
length of a line, so backslash continuation is never strictly necessary;
it just makes programs more readable.  For this same reason, as well as
for clarity, we have kept most statements short in the sample programs
presented throughout the Web page.  Backslash continuation is
most useful when your <span class="command">awk</span> program is in a separate source file
instead of entered from the command line.  You should also note that
many <span class="command">awk</span> implementations are more particular about where you
may use backslash continuation. For example, they may not allow you to
split a string constant using backslash continuation.  Thus, for maximum
portability of your <span class="command">awk</span> programs, it is best not to split your
lines in the middle of a regular expression or a string. 
<!-- 10/2000: gawk, mawk, and current bell labs awk allow it, -->
<!-- solaris 2.7 nawk does not. Solaris /usr/xpg4/bin/awk does though!  sigh. -->

with the C shell.</em>  It works for <span class="command">awk</span> programs in files and
for one-shot programs, <em>provided</em> you are using a POSIX-compliant
shell, such as the Unix Bourne shell or <span class="command">bash</span>.  But the C shell behaves
differently!  There, you must use two backslashes in a row, followed by
a newline.  Note also that when using the C shell, <em>every</em> newline
in your awk program must be escaped with a backslash. To illustrate:

<pre class="example">     % awk 'BEGIN { \
     ?   print \\
     ?       "hello, world" \
     ? }'
     -| hello, world
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, the <span class="samp">%</span> and <span class="samp">?</span> are the C shell's primary and secondary
prompts, analogous to the standard shell's <span class="samp">$</span> and <span class="samp">&gt;</span>.

   <p>Compare the previous example to how it is done with a POSIX-compliant shell:

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN {
     &gt;   print \
     &gt;       "hello, world"
     &gt; }'
     -| hello, world
</pre>
   <p><span class="command">awk</span> is a line-oriented language.  Each rule's action has to
begin on the same line as the pattern.  To have the pattern and action
on separate lines, you <em>must</em> use backslash continuation; there
is no other option.

   <p><a name="index-backslash-_0028_0040code_007b_005c_007d_0029_002c-continuing-lines-and_002c-comments-and-159"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005c_007d-_0028backslash_0029_002c-continuing-lines-and_002c-comments-and-160"></a><a name="index-commenting_002c-backslash-continuation-and-161"></a>Another thing to keep in mind is that backslash continuation and
comments do not mix. As soon as <span class="command">awk</span> sees the <span class="samp">#</span> that
starts a comment, it ignores <em>everything</em> on the rest of the
line. For example:

<pre class="example">     $ gawk 'BEGIN { print "dont panic" # a friendly \
     &gt;                                    BEGIN rule
     &gt; }'
     error--&gt; gawk: cmd. line:2:                BEGIN rule
     error--&gt; gawk: cmd. line:2:                ^ parse error
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this case, it looks like the backslash would continue the comment onto the
next line. However, the backslash-newline combination is never even
noticed because it is &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; inside the comment. Thus, the
<code>BEGIN</code> is noted as a syntax error.

   <p><a name="index-statements_002c-multiple-162"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_003b_007d-_0028semicolon_0029-163"></a><a name="index-semicolon-_0028_0040code_007b_003b_007d_0029-164"></a>When <span class="command">awk</span> statements within one rule are short, you might want to put
more than one of them on a line.  This is accomplished by separating the statements
with a semicolon (<span class="samp">;</span>). 
This also applies to the rules themselves. 
Thus, the program shown at the start of this section
could also be written this way:

<pre class="example">     /12/ { print $0 } ; /21/ { print $0 }
</pre>
   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> The requirement that states that rules on the same line must be
separated with a semicolon was not in the original <span class="command">awk</span>
language; it was added for consistency with the treatment of statements
within an action.

<h3 class="section">1.7 Other Features of <span class="command">awk</span></h3>

<p><a name="index-variables-165"></a>The <span class="command">awk</span> language provides a number of predefined, or
<dfn>built-in</dfn>, variables that your programs can use to get information
from <span class="command">awk</span>.  There are other variables your program can set
as well to control how <span class="command">awk</span> processes your data.

   <p>In addition, <span class="command">awk</span> provides a number of built-in functions for doing
common computational and string-related operations. 
<span class="command">gawk</span> provides built-in functions for working with timestamps,
performing bit manipulation, and for runtime string translation.

   <p>As we develop our presentation of the <span class="command">awk</span> language, we introduce
most of the variables and many of the functions. They are defined
systematically in <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>, and

<h3 class="section">1.8 When to Use <span class="command">awk</span></h3>

<p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-uses-for-166"></a>Now that you've seen some of what <span class="command">awk</span> can do,
you might wonder how <span class="command">awk</span> could be useful for you.  By using
utility programs, advanced patterns, field separators, arithmetic
statements, and other selection criteria, you can produce much more
complex output.  The <span class="command">awk</span> language is very useful for producing
reports from large amounts of raw data, such as summarizing information
from the output of other utility programs like <span class="command">ls</span>. 
(See <a href="#More-Complex">More Complex</a>.)

   <p>Programs written with <span class="command">awk</span> are usually much smaller than they would
be in other languages.  This makes <span class="command">awk</span> programs easy to compose and
use.  Often, <span class="command">awk</span> programs can be quickly composed at your terminal,
used once, and thrown away.  Because <span class="command">awk</span> programs are interpreted, you
can avoid the (usually lengthy) compilation part of the typical
edit-compile-test-debug cycle of software development.

   <p>Complex programs have been written in <span class="command">awk</span>, including a complete
retargetable assembler for eight-bit microprocessors (see <a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a>, for
more information), and a microcode assembler for a special-purpose Prolog
computer.  More recently, <span class="command">gawk</span> was used for writing a Wiki
clone.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-12" name="fnd-12"><sup>12</sup></a>
While the original <span class="command">awk</span>'s capabilities were strained by tasks
of such complexity, modern versions are more capable.  Even the Bell
Labs version of <span class="command">awk</span> has fewer predefined limits, and those
that it has are much larger than they used to be.

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-complex-167"></a>If you find yourself writing <span class="command">awk</span> scripts of more than, say, a few
hundred lines, you might consider using a different programming
language.  Emacs Lisp is a good choice if you need sophisticated string
or pattern matching capabilities.  The shell is also good at string and
pattern matching; in addition, it allows powerful use of the system
utilities.  More conventional languages, such as C, C++, and Java, offer
better facilities for system programming and for managing the complexity
of large programs.  Programs in these languages may require more lines
of source code than the equivalent <span class="command">awk</span> programs, but they are
easier to maintain and usually run more efficiently.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Regular Expressions</h2>

<p><a name="index-regexp_002c-See-regular-expressions-168"></a><!-- STARTOFRANGE regexp -->
<a name="index-regular-expressions-169"></a>
A <dfn>regular expression</dfn>, or <dfn>regexp</dfn>, is a way of describing a
set of strings. 
Because regular expressions are such a fundamental part of <span class="command">awk</span>
programming, their format and use deserve a separate chapter.

   <p><a name="index-forward-slash-_0028_0040code_007b_002f_007d_0029-170"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002f_007d-_0028forward-slash_0029-171"></a>A regular expression enclosed in slashes (<span class="samp">/</span>)
is an <span class="command">awk</span> pattern that matches every input record whose text
belongs to that set. 
The simplest regular expression is a sequence of letters, numbers, or
both.  Such a regexp matches any string that contains that sequence. 
Thus, the regexp <span class="samp">foo</span> matches any string containing <span class="samp">foo</span>. 
Therefore, the pattern <code>/foo/</code> matches any input record containing
the three characters <span class="samp">foo</span> <em>anywhere</em> in the record.  Other
kinds of regexps let you specify more complicated classes of strings.

   <p>Initially, the examples in this chapter are simple. 
As we explain more about how
regular expressions work, we will present more complicated instances.

<h3 class="section">2.1 How to Use Regular Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-regular-expressions_002c-as-patterns-172"></a>A regular expression can be used as a pattern by enclosing it in
slashes.  Then the regular expression is tested against the
entire text of each record.  (Normally, it only needs
to match some part of the text in order to succeed.)  For example, the
following prints the second field of each record that contains the string
<span class="samp">foo</span> anywhere in it:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '/foo/ { print $2 }' BBS-list
     -| 555-1234

<!-- @cindex statements, @code{while} -->
<!-- @cindex statements, @code{do} -->
Regular expressions can also be used in matching expressions.  These
expressions allow you to specify the string to match against; it need
not be the entire current input record.  The two operators <span class="samp">~</span>
and <span class="samp">!~</span> perform regular expression comparisons.  Expressions
using these operators can be used as patterns, or in <code>if</code>,
<code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>do</code> statements. 
(See <a href="#Statements">Statements</a>.) 
For example:

<pre class="example">     <var>exp</var> ~ /<var>regexp</var>/
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is true if the expression <var>exp</var> (taken as a string)
matches <var>regexp</var>.  The following example matches, or selects,
all input records with the uppercase letter <span class="samp">J</span> somewhere in the
first field:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '$1 ~ /J/' inventory-shipped
     -| Jan  13  25  15 115
     -| Jun  31  42  75 492
     -| Jul  24  34  67 436
     -| Jan  21  36  64 620
</pre>
   <p>So does this:

<pre class="example">     awk '{ if ($1 ~ /J/) print }' inventory-shipped
</pre>
   <p>This next example is true if the expression <var>exp</var>
(taken as a character string)
does <em>not</em> match <var>regexp</var>:

<pre class="example">     <var>exp</var> !~ /<var>regexp</var>/
</pre>
   <p>The following example matches,
or selects, all input records whose first field <em>does not</em> contain
the uppercase letter <span class="samp">J</span>:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '$1 !~ /J/' inventory-shipped
     -| Feb  15  32  24 226
     -| Mar  15  24  34 228
     -| Apr  31  52  63 420
     -| May  16  34  29 208

</pre>
   <p><a name="index-regexp-constants-182"></a><a name="index-regular-expressions_002c-constants_002c-See-regexp-constants-183"></a>When a regexp is enclosed in slashes, such as <code>/foo/</code>, we call it

(<code>"foo"</code>) or regexp constants (<code>/foo/</code>). 
Instead, they should be represented with <dfn>escape sequences</dfn>,
which are character sequences beginning with a backslash (<span class="samp">\</span>). 
One use of an escape sequence is to include a double-quote character in
a string constant.  Because a plain double quote ends the string, you
must use <span class="samp">\"</span> to represent an actual double-quote character as a
part of the string.  For example:

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN { print "He said \"hi!\" to her." }'
     -| He said "hi!" to her.
</pre>
   <p>The  backslash character itself is another character that cannot be
included normally; you must write <span class="samp">\\</span> to put one backslash in the
string or regexp.  Thus, the string whose contents are the two characters
<span class="samp">"</span> and <span class="samp">\</span> must be written <code>"\"\\"</code>.

   <p>Backslash also represents unprintable characters
such as TAB or newline.  While there is nothing to stop you from entering most
unprintable characters directly in a string constant or regexp constant,
they may look ugly.

   <p>The following table lists
all the escape sequences used in <span class="command">awk</span> and
what they represent. Unless noted otherwise, all these escape
sequences apply to both string constants and regexp constants:

     <dl>

   <p>In <span class="command">gawk</span>, a number of additional two-character sequences that begin
with a backslash have special meaning in regexps. 
See <a href="#GNU-Regexp-Operators">GNU Regexp Operators</a>.

   <p>In a regexp, a backslash before any character that is not in the previous list
and not listed in
<a href="#GNU-Regexp-Operators">GNU Regexp Operators</a>,
means that the next character should be taken literally, even if it would
normally be a regexp operator.  For example, <code>/a\+b/</code> matches the three
characters <span class="samp">a+b</span>.

   <p><a name="index-backslash-_0028_0040code_007b_005c_007d_0029_002c-in-escape-sequences-209"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005c_007d-_0028backslash_0029_002c-in-escape-sequences-210"></a><a name="index-portability-211"></a>For complete portability, do not use a backslash before any character not
shown in the previous list.

   <p>To summarize:

     <ul>
<li>The escape sequences in the table above are always processed first,
for both string constants and regexp constants. This happens very early,
as soon as <span class="command">awk</span> reads your program.

     <li><span class="command">gawk</span> processes both regexp constants and dynamic regexps
(see <a href="#Computed-Regexps">Computed Regexps</a>),
for the special operators listed in
<a href="#GNU-Regexp-Operators">GNU Regexp Operators</a>.

     <li>A backslash before any other character means to treat that character
literally.

<p><a name="index-metacharacters_002c-escape-sequences-for-219"></a>
Suppose you use an octal or hexadecimal
escape to represent a regexp metacharacter. 
(See <a href="#Regexp-Operators">Regexp Operators</a>.) 
Does <span class="command">awk</span> treat the character as a literal character or as a regexp
operator?

   <p><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-escape-sequences_002c-for-metacharacters-220"></a>Historically, such characters were taken literally. 
(d.c.) 
However, the POSIX standard indicates that they should be treated
as real metacharacters, which is what <span class="command">gawk</span> does. 
In compatibility mode (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>),
<span class="command">gawk</span> treats the characters represented by octal and hexadecimal
escape sequences literally when used in regexp constants. Thus,
<code>/a\52b/</code> is equivalent to <code>/a\*b/</code>.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Regular Expression Operators</h3>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE regexpo -->
<p><a name="index-regular-expressions_002c-operators-221"></a>
You can combine regular expressions with special characters,
called <dfn>regular expression operators</dfn> or <dfn>metacharacters</dfn>, to
increase the power and versatility of regular expressions.

   <p>The escape sequences described
earlier
in <a href="#Escape-Sequences">Escape Sequences</a>,
are valid inside a regexp.  They are introduced by a <span class="samp">\</span> and
are recognized and converted into corresponding real characters as
the very first step in processing regexps.

   <p>Here is a list of metacharacters.  All characters that are not escape
sequences and that are not listed in the table stand for themselves:

     
<a name="index-backslash-_0028_0040code_007b_005c_007d_0029-222"></a>
<a name="index-_0040code_007b_005c_007d-_0028backslash_0029-223"></a>
<dl><dt><code>\</code><dd>This is used to suppress the special meaning of a character when
matching.  For example, <span class="samp">\$</span>
matches the character <span class="samp">$</span>.

     <p><a name="index-regular-expressions_002c-anchors-in-224"></a><a name="index-Texinfo_002c-chapter-beginnings-in-files-225"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005e_007d-_0028caret_0029-226"></a><a name="index-caret-_0028_0040code_007b_005e_007d_0029-227"></a><br><dt><code>^</code><dd>This matches the beginning of a string.  For example, <span class="samp">^@chapter</span>
matches <span class="samp">@chapter</span> at the beginning of a string and can be used
to identify chapter beginnings in Texinfo source files. 
The <span class="samp">^</span> is known as an <dfn>anchor</dfn>, because it anchors the pattern to
match only at the beginning of the string.

     <p>It is important to realize that <span class="samp">^</span> does not match the beginning of
a line embedded in a string. 
The condition is not true in the following example:

     <pre class="example">          if ("line1\nLINE 2" ~ /^L/) ...

For example, <span class="samp">p$</span>
matches a record that ends with a <span class="samp">p</span>.  The <span class="samp">$</span> is an anchor
and does not match the end of a line embedded in a string. 
The condition in the following example is not true:

     <pre class="example">          if ("line1\nLINE 2" ~ /1$/) ...

concatenation, we can make a regular expression such as <span class="samp">U.A</span>, which
matches any three-character sequence that begins with <span class="samp">U</span> and ends
with <span class="samp">A</span>.

<span class="samp">.</span> does not match the <span class="sc">nul</span>

Otherwise, <span class="sc">nul</span> is just another character. Other versions of <span class="command">awk</span>
may not be able to match the <span class="sc">nul</span> character.

For example, <span class="samp">^P|[[:digit:]]</span>
matches any string that matches either <span class="samp">^P</span> or <span class="samp">[[:digit:]]</span>.  This
means it matches any string that starts with <span class="samp">P</span> or contains a digit.

     <p>The alternation applies to the largest possible regexps on either side.

just <span class="samp">p</span> if no <span class="samp">h</span>s are present.

     <p>The <span class="samp">*</span> repeats the <em>smallest</em> possible preceding expression.

Within a character list, a <dfn>range expression</dfn> consists of two
characters separated by a hyphen.  It matches any single character that
sorts between the two characters, using the locale's
collating sequence and character set.  For example, in the default C
locale, <span class="samp">[a-dx-z]</span> is equivalent to <span class="samp">[abcdxyz]</span>.  Many locales
sort characters in dictionary order, and in these locales,
<span class="samp">[a-dx-z]</span> is typically not equivalent to <span class="samp">[abcdxyz]</span>; instead it
might be equivalent to <span class="samp">[aBbCcDdxXyYz]</span>, for example.  To obtain
the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C
locale by setting the <span class="env">LC_ALL</span> environment variable to the value
<span class="samp">C</span>.

A character class is a special notation for describing
lists of characters that have a specific attribute, but the
actual characters can vary from country to country and/or
from character set to character set.  For example, the notion of what
is an alphabetic character differs between the United States and France.

   <p>A character class is only valid in a regexp <em>inside</em> the
brackets of a character list.  Character classes consist of <span class="samp">[:</span>,
a keyword denoting the class, and <span class="samp">:]</span>.

POSIX standard.

   <p>For example, before the POSIX standard, you had to write <code>/[A-Za-z0-9]/</code>
to match alphanumeric characters.  If your
character set had other alphabetic characters in it, this would not
match them, and if your character set collated differently from
ASCII, this might not even match the ASCII alphanumeric characters. 
With the POSIX character classes, you can write
<code>/[[:alnum:]]/</code> to match the alphabetic
and numeric characters in your character set.

   <p><a name="index-character-lists_002c-collating-elements-271"></a><a name="index-character-lists_002c-non_002dASCII-272"></a><a name="index-collating-elements-273"></a>Two additional special sequences can appear in character lists. 
These apply to non-ASCII character sets, which can have single symbols
(called <dfn>collating elements</dfn>) that are represented with more than one
character. They can also have several characters that are equivalent for
<dfn>collating</dfn>, or sorting, purposes.  (For example, in French, a plain &ldquo;e&rdquo;
and a grave-accented &ldquo;&egrave;&rdquo; are equivalent.) 
These sequences are:

     
<a name="index-character-lists_002c-collating-symbols-274"></a>
<a name="index-collating-symbols-275"></a>
<dl><dt>Collating symbols<dd>Multicharacter collating elements enclosed between
<span class="samp">[.</span> and <span class="samp">.]</span>.  For example, if <span class="samp">ch</span> is a collating element,
then <code>[[.ch.]]</code> is a regexp that matches this collating element, whereas
<code>[ch]</code> is a regexp that matches either <span class="samp">c</span> or <span class="samp">h</span>.

     <p><a name="index-character-lists_002c-equivalence-classes-276"></a><br><dt>Equivalence classes<dd>Locale-specific names for a list of
characters that are equal. The name is enclosed between
<span class="samp">[=</span> and <span class="samp">=]</span>. 
For example, the name <span class="samp">e</span> might be used to represent all of
&ldquo;e,&rdquo; &ldquo;&egrave;,&rdquo; and &ldquo;&eacute;.&rdquo; In this case, <code>[[=e=]]</code> is a regexp
that matches any of <span class="samp">e</span>, <span class="samp">&eacute;</span>, or <span class="samp">&egrave;</span>.

   <p>These features are very valuable in non-English-speaking locales.

sets.  Thus, a <span class="samp">w</span> in a regular expression matches only a lowercase
<span class="samp">w</span> and not an uppercase <span class="samp">W</span>.

   <p>The simplest way to do a case-independent match is to use a character
list&mdash;for example, <span class="samp">[Ww]</span>.  However, this can be cumbersome if
you need to use it often, and it can make the regular expressions harder
to read.  There are two alternatives that you might prefer.

   <p>One way to perform a case-insensitive match at a particular point in the
program is to convert the data to a single case, using the
<code>tolower</code> or <code>toupper</code> built-in string functions (which we
haven't discussed yet;
see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>). 
For example:

<pre class="example">     tolower($1) ~ /foo/  { ... }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">converts the first field to lowercase before matching against it. 
This works in any POSIX-compliant <span class="command">awk</span>.

Another method, specific to <span class="command">gawk</span>, is to set the variable
<code>IGNORECASE</code> to a nonzero value (see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>). 
When <code>IGNORECASE</code> is not zero, <em>all</em> regexp and string
operations ignore case.  Changing the value of
<code>IGNORECASE</code> dynamically controls the case-sensitivity of the
program as it runs.  Case is significant by default because
<code>IGNORECASE</code> (like most variables) is initialized to zero:

<pre class="example">     x = "aB"
     if (x ~ /ab/) ...   # this test will fail
     
     IGNORECASE = 1
     if (x ~ /ab/) ...   # now it will succeed
</pre>
   <p>In general, you cannot use <code>IGNORECASE</code> to make certain rules
case-insensitive and other rules case-sensitive, because there is no
straightforward way
to set <code>IGNORECASE</code> just for the pattern of
a particular rule.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-15" name="fnd-15"><sup>15</sup></a>
To do this, use either character lists or <code>tolower</code>.  However, one
thing you can do with <code>IGNORECASE</code> only is dynamically turn
case-sensitivity on or off for all the rules at once.

   <p><code>IGNORECASE</code> can be set on the command line or in a <code>BEGIN</code> rule
(see <a href="#Other-Arguments">Other Arguments</a>; also
see <a href="#Using-BEGIN_002fEND">Using BEGIN/END</a>). 
Setting <code>IGNORECASE</code> from the command line is a way to make
a program case-insensitive without having to edit it.

   <p>Prior to <span class="command">gawk</span> 3.0, the value of <code>IGNORECASE</code>
affected regexp operations only. It did not affect string comparison
with <span class="samp">==</span>, <span class="samp">!=</span>, and so on. 
Beginning with version 3.0, both regexp and string comparison
operations are also affected by <code>IGNORECASE</code>.

<!-- @cindex ISO 8859-1 -->
<!-- @cindex ISO Latin-1 -->
<p>Beginning with <span class="command">gawk</span> 3.0,
the equivalences between upper-
and lowercase characters are based on the ISO-8859-1 (ISO Latin-1)
character set. This character set is a superset of the traditional 128
ASCII characters, which also provides a number of characters suitable
for use with European languages.

   <p>As of <span class="command">gawk</span> 3.1.4, the case equivalences are fully
locale-aware.  They are based on the C <code>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</code> facilities,
such as <code>isalpha()</code> and <code>toupper()</code>.

   <p>The value of <code>IGNORECASE</code> has no effect if <span class="command">gawk</span> is in
compatibility mode (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>). 
Case is always significant in compatibility mode.

Consider the following:

<pre class="example">     echo aaaabcd | awk '{ sub(/a+/, "&lt;A&gt;"); print }'
</pre>
   <p>This example uses the <code>sub</code> function (which we haven't discussed yet;
see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>)
to make a change to the input record. Here, the regexp <code>/a+/</code>
indicates &ldquo;one or more <span class="samp">a</span> characters,&rdquo; and the replacement
text is <span class="samp">&lt;A&gt;</span>.

   <p>The input contains four <span class="samp">a</span> characters. 
<span class="command">awk</span> (and POSIX) regular expressions always match
the leftmost, <em>longest</em> sequence of input characters that can
match.  Thus, all four <span class="samp">a</span> characters are
replaced with <span class="samp">&lt;A&gt;</span> in this example:

<pre class="example">     $ echo aaaabcd | awk '{ sub(/a+/, "&lt;A&gt;"); print }'
     -| &lt;A&gt;bcd
</pre>
   <p>For simple match/no-match tests, this is not so important. But when doing
text matching and substitutions with the <code>match</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>gsub</code>,
and <code>gensub</code> functions, it is very important. 
Understanding this principle is also important for regexp-based record
and field splitting (see <a href="#Records">Records</a>,

<!-- @cindex operators, @code{!~} -->
The righthand side of a <span class="samp">~</span> or <span class="samp">!~</span> operator need not be a
regexp constant (i.e., a string of characters between slashes).  It may
be any expression.  The expression is evaluated and converted to a string
if necessary; the contents of the string are used as the
regexp.  A regexp that is computed in this way is called a <dfn>dynamic
regexp</dfn>:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN { digits_regexp = "[[:digit:]]+" }
     $0 ~ digits_regexp    { print }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This sets <code>digits_regexp</code> to a regexp that describes one or more digits,
and tests whether the input record matches this regexp.

   <p><strong>Caution:</strong> When using the <span class="samp">~</span> and <span class="samp">!~</span>
operators, there is a difference between a regexp constant
enclosed in slashes and a string constant enclosed in double quotes. 
If you are going to use a string constant, you have to understand that
the string is, in essence, scanned <em>twice</em>: the first time when
<span class="command">awk</span> reads your program, and the second time when it goes to
match the string on the lefthand side of the operator with the pattern
on the right.  This is true of any string-valued expression (such as
<code>digits_regexp</code>, shown previously), not just string constants.

   <p><a name="index-regexp-constants_002c-slashes-vs_002e_0040_003a-quotes-331"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005c_007d-_0028backslash_0029_002c-regexp-constants-332"></a><a name="index-backslash-_0028_0040code_007b_005c_007d_0029_002c-regexp-constants-333"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0022_007d-_0028double-quote_0029_002c-regexp-constants-334"></a><a name="index-double-quote-_0028_0040code_007b_0022_007d_0029_002c-regexp-constants-335"></a>What difference does it make if the string is
scanned twice? The answer has to do with escape sequences, and particularly
with backslashes.  To get a backslash into a regular expression inside a
string, you have to type two backslashes.

   <p>For example, <code>/\*/</code> is a regexp constant for a literal <span class="samp">*</span>. 
Only one backslash is needed.  To do the same thing with a string,
you have to type <code>"\\*"</code>.  The first backslash escapes the
second one so that the string actually contains the
two characters <span class="samp">\</span> and <span class="samp">*</span>.

regular expressions, which should you use?  The answer is &ldquo;regexp
constants,&rdquo; for several reasons:

     <ul>
<li>String constants are more complicated to write and
more difficult to read. Using regexp constants makes your programs
less error-prone.  Not understanding the difference between the two
kinds of constants is a common source of errors.

     <li>It is more efficient to use regexp constants. <span class="command">awk</span> can note
that you have supplied a regexp and store it internally in a form that
makes pattern matching more efficient.  When using a string constant,
<span class="command">awk</span> must first convert the string into this internal form and
then perform the pattern matching.

     <li>Using regexp constants is better form; it shows clearly that you
intend a regexp match.

<p><a name="index-regular-expressions_002c-dynamic_002c-with-embedded-newlines-339"></a><a name="index-newlines_002c-in-dynamic-regexps-340"></a>
Some commercial versions of <span class="command">awk</span> do not allow the newline

<h3 class="section">2.9 Where You Are Makes A Difference</h3>

<p><a name="index-locale_002c-definition-of-342"></a>
Modern systems support the notion of <dfn>locales</dfn>: a way to tell
the system about the local character set and language.  The current
locale setting can affect the way regexp matching works, often
in surprising ways.  In particular, many locales do case-insensitive
matching, even when you may have specified characters of only
one particular case.

   <p>The following example uses the <code>sub</code> function, which
does text replacement
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>). 
Here, the intent is to remove trailing uppercase characters:

<pre class="example">     $ echo something1234abc | gawk '{ sub("[A-Z]*$", ""); print }'
     -| something1234
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This output is unexpected, since the <span class="samp">abc</span> at the end of <span class="samp">something1234abc</span>
should not normally match <span class="samp">[A-Z]*</span>.  This result is due to the
locale setting (and thus you may not see it on your system). 
There are two fixes.  The first is to use the POSIX character
class <span class="samp">[[:upper:]]</span>, instead of <span class="samp">[A-Z]</span>. 
(This is preferred, since then your program will work everywhere.) 
The second is to change the locale setting in the environment,
before running <span class="command">gawk</span>,
by using the shell statements:

<pre class="example">     LANG=C LC_ALL=C
     export LANG LC_ALL
</pre>
   <p>The setting <span class="samp">C</span> forces <span class="command">gawk</span> to behave in the traditional
Unix manner, where case distinctions do matter. 
You may wish to put these statements into your shell startup file,
e.g., <span class="file">$HOME/.profile</span>.

   <p>Similar considerations apply to other ranges.  For example,
<span class="samp">["-/]</span> is perfectly valid in ASCII, but is not valid in many
Unicode locales, such as <span class="samp">en_US.UTF-8</span>.  (In general, such
ranges should be avoided; either list the characters individually,
or use a POSIX character class such as <span class="samp">[[:punct:]]</span>.)

   <p>For the normal case of <span class="samp">RS = "\n"</span>, the locale is largely irrelevant. 
For other single-character record separators, using <span class="samp">LC_ALL=C</span>
will give you much better performance when reading records.  Otherwise,
<span class="command">gawk</span> has to make several function calls, <em>per input
character</em> to find the record terminator.

   <p>Finally, the locale affects the value of the decimal point character
used when <span class="command">gawk</span> parses input data.  This is discussed in
detail in <a href="#Conversion">Conversion</a>.

standard input (by default, this is the keyboard, but often it is a pipe from another
command) or from files whose names you specify on the <span class="command">awk</span>
command line.  If you specify input files, <span class="command">awk</span> reads them
in order, processing all the data from one before going on to the next. 
The name of the current input file can be found in the built-in variable
<code>FILENAME</code>
(see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>).

   <p><a name="index-records-346"></a><a name="index-fields-347"></a>The input is read in units called <dfn>records</dfn>, and is processed by the
rules of your program one record at a time. 
By default, each record is one line.  Each
record is automatically split into chunks called <dfn>fields</dfn>. 
This makes it more convenient for programs to work on the parts of a record.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetline_007d-command-348"></a>On rare occasions, you may need to use the <code>getline</code> command. 
The  <code>getline</code> command is valuable, both because it
can do explicit input from any number of files, and because the files
used with it do not have to be named on the <span class="command">awk</span> command line
(see <a href="#Getline">Getline</a>).

program into records and fields. 
<span class="command">awk</span> keeps track of the number of records that have
been read
so far
from the current input file.  This value is stored in a
built-in variable called <code>FNR</code>.  It is reset to zero when a new
file is started.  Another built-in variable, <code>NR</code>, is the total
number of input records read so far from all data files.  It starts at zero,
but is never automatically reset to zero.

   <p><a name="index-separators_002c-for-records-353"></a><a name="index-record-separators-354"></a>Records are separated by a character called the <dfn>record separator</dfn>. 
By default, the record separator is the newline character. 
This is why records are, by default, single lines. 
A different character can be used for the record separator by
assigning the character to the built-in variable <code>RS</code>.

   <p><a name="index-newlines_002c-as-record-separators-355"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bRS_007d-variable-356"></a>Like any other variable,
the value of <code>RS</code> can be changed in the <span class="command">awk</span> program
with the assignment operator, <span class="samp">=</span>
(see <a href="#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Ops</a>). 
The new record-separator character should be enclosed in quotation marks,
which indicate a string constant.  Often the right time to do this is
at the beginning of execution, before any input is processed,
so that the very first record is read with the proper separator. 
To do this, use the special <code>BEGIN</code> pattern
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>). 
For example:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern-357"></a>
<pre class="example">     awk 'BEGIN { RS = "/" }
          { print $0 }' BBS-list
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">changes the value of <code>RS</code> to <code>"/"</code>, before reading any input. 
This is a string whose first character is a slash; as a result, records
are separated by slashes.  Then the input file is read, and the second
rule in the <span class="command">awk</span> program (the action with no pattern) prints each
record.  Because each <code>print</code> statement adds a newline at the end of
its output, this <span class="command">awk</span> program copies the input
with each slash changed to a newline.  Here are the results of running
the program on <span class="file">BBS-list</span>:

   <p class="noindent">It has one baud rate only, so there are no slashes in the record,
unlike the others which have two or more baud rates. 
In fact, this record is treated as part of the record
for the <span class="samp">core</span> BBS; the newline separating them in the output
is the original newline in the data file, not the one added by
<span class="command">awk</span> when it printed the record!

   <p><a name="index-record-separators_002c-changing-358"></a><a name="index-separators_002c-for-records-359"></a>Another way to change the record separator is on the command line,
using the variable-assignment feature
(see <a href="#Other-Arguments">Other Arguments</a>):

<pre class="example">     awk '{ print $0 }' RS="/" BBS-list
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This sets <code>RS</code> to <span class="samp">/</span> before processing <span class="file">BBS-list</span>.

   <p>Using an unusual character such as <span class="samp">/</span> for the record separator
produces correct behavior in the vast majority of cases.  However,
the following (extreme) pipeline prints a surprising <span class="samp">1</span>:

<pre class="example">     $ echo | awk 'BEGIN { RS = "a" } ; { print NF }'
     -| 1
</pre>
   <p>There is one field, consisting of a newline.  The value of the built-in
variable <code>NF</code> is the number of fields in the current record.

   <p><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-input-files-360"></a>Reaching the end of an input file terminates the current input record,
even if the last character in the file is not the character in <code>RS</code>. 
(d.c.)

   <p><a name="index-null-strings-361"></a><a name="index-strings_002c-empty_002c-See-null-strings-362"></a>The empty string <code>""</code> (a string without any characters)
has a special meaning
as the value of <code>RS</code>. It means that records are separated
by one or more blank lines and nothing else. 
See <a href="#Multiple-Line">Multiple Line</a>, for more details.

   <p>If you change the value of <code>RS</code> in the middle of an <span class="command">awk</span> run,
the new value is used to delimit subsequent records, but the record
currently being processed, as well as records already processed, are not
affected.

sets the variable <code>RT</code> to the text in the input that matched
<code>RS</code>. 
When using <span class="command">gawk</span>,
the value of <code>RS</code> is not limited to a one-character
string.  It can be any regular expression
(see <a href="#Regexp">Regexp</a>). 
In general, each record
ends at the next string that matches the regular expression; the next
record starts at the end of the matching string.  This general rule is
actually at work in the usual case, where <code>RS</code> contains just a
newline: a record ends at the beginning of the next matching string (the
next newline in the input), and the following record starts just after
the end of this string (at the first character of the following line). 
The newline, because it matches <code>RS</code>, is not part of either record.

   <p>When <code>RS</code> is a single character, <code>RT</code>
contains the same single character. However, when <code>RS</code> is a
regular expression, <code>RT</code> contains
the actual input text that matched the regular expression.

   <p>The following example illustrates both of these features. 
It sets <code>RS</code> equal to a regular expression that
matches either a newline or a series of one or more uppercase letters
with optional leading and/or trailing whitespace:

<pre class="example">     $ echo record 1 AAAA record 2 BBBB record 3 |
     &gt; gawk 'BEGIN { RS = "\n|( *[[:upper:]]+ *)" }
     &gt;             { print "Record =", $0, "and RT =", RT }'
     -| Record = record 1 and RT =  AAAA
     -| Record = record 2 and RT =  BBBB
     -| Record = record 3 and RT =
     -|
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The final line of output has an extra blank line. This is because the
value of <code>RT</code> is a newline, and the <code>print</code> statement
supplies its own terminating newline. 
See <a href="#Simple-Sed">Simple Sed</a>, for a more useful example
of <code>RS</code> as a regexp and <code>RT</code>.

   <p>If you set <code>RS</code> to a regular expression that allows optional
trailing text, such as <span class="samp">RS = "abc(XYZ)?"</span> it is possible, due
to implementation constraints, that <span class="command">gawk</span> may match the leading
part of the regular expression, but not the trailing part, particularly
if the input text that could match the trailing part is fairly long. 
<span class="command">gawk</span> attempts to avoid this problem, but currently, there's
no guarantee that this will never happen.

   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> Remember that in <span class="command">awk</span>, the <span class="samp">^</span> and <span class="samp">$</span> anchor
metacharacters match the beginning and end of a <em>string</em>, and not
the beginning and end of a <em>line</em>.  As a result, something like
<span class="samp">RS = "^[[:upper:]]"</span> can only match at the beginning of a file. 
This is because <span class="command">gawk</span> views the input file as one long string
that happens to contain newline characters in it. 
It is thus best to avoid anchor characters in the value of <code>RS</code>.

automatically <dfn>parsed</dfn> or separated by the interpreter into chunks
called <dfn>fields</dfn>.  By default, fields are separated by <dfn>whitespace</dfn>,
like words in a line. 
Whitespace in <span class="command">awk</span> means any string of one or more spaces,
tabs, or newlines;<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-17" name="fnd-17"><sup>17</sup></a> other characters, such as
formfeed, vertical tab, etc. that are
considered whitespace by other languages, are <em>not</em> considered
whitespace by <span class="command">awk</span>.

   <p>The purpose of fields is to make it more convenient for you to refer to
these pieces of the record.  You don't have to use them&mdash;you can
operate on the whole record if you want&mdash;but fields are what make
simple <span class="command">awk</span> programs so powerful.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0024_007d-field-operator-384"></a><a name="index-field-operator-_0040code_007b_0024_007d-385"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0024_007d-_0028dollar-sign_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_0024_007d-field-operator-386"></a><a name="index-dollar-sign-_0028_0040code_007b_0024_007d_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_0024_007d-field-operator-387"></a><a name="index-field-operators_0040comma_007b_007d-dollar-sign-as-388"></a>A dollar-sign (<span class="samp">$</span>) is used
to refer to a field in an <span class="command">awk</span> program,
followed by the number of the field you want.  Thus, <code>$1</code>
refers to the first field, <code>$2</code> to the second, and so on. 
(Unlike the Unix shells, the field numbers are not limited to single digits. 
<code>$127</code> is the one hundred twenty-seventh field in the record.) 
For example, suppose the following is a line of input:

<pre class="example">     This seems like a pretty nice example.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here the first field, or <code>$1</code>, is <span class="samp">This</span>, the second field, or
<code>$2</code>, is <span class="samp">seems</span>, and so on.  Note that the last field,
<code>$7</code>, is <span class="samp">example.</span>.  Because there is no space between the
<span class="samp">e</span> and the <span class="samp">.</span>, the period is considered part of the seventh
field.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bNF_007d-variable-389"></a><a name="index-fields_002c-number-of-390"></a><code>NF</code> is a built-in variable whose value is the number of fields
in the current record.  <span class="command">awk</span> automatically updates the value
of <code>NF</code> each time it reads a record.  No matter how many fields
there are, the last field in a record can be represented by <code>$NF</code>. 
So, <code>$NF</code> is the same as <code>$7</code>, which is <span class="samp">example.</span>. 
If you try to reference a field beyond the last
one (such as <code>$8</code> when the record has only seven fields), you get
the empty string.  (If used in a numeric operation, you get zero.)

   <p>The use of <code>$0</code>, which looks like a reference to the &ldquo;zero-th&rdquo; field, is
a special case: it represents the whole input record
when you are not interested in specific fields. 
Here are some more examples:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '$1 ~ /foo/ { print $0 }' BBS-list
     -| fooey        555-1234     2400/1200/300     B
     -| foot         555-6699     1200/300          B
     -| macfoo       555-6480     1200/300          A
     -| sabafoo      555-2127     1200/300          C
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This example prints each record in the file <span class="file">BBS-list</span> whose first
field contains the string <span class="samp">foo</span>.  The operator <span class="samp">~</span> is called a
<dfn>matching operator</dfn>
(see <a href="#Regexp-Usage">Regexp Usage</a>);
it tests whether a string (here, the field <code>$1</code>) matches a given regular
expression.

   <p>By contrast, the following example
looks for <span class="samp">foo</span> in <em>the entire record</em> and prints the first
field and the last field for each matching input record:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '/foo/ { print $1, $NF }' BBS-list
     -| fooey B
     -| foot B
     -| macfoo A

<h3 class="section">3.3 Nonconstant Field Numbers</h3>

<p><a name="index-fields_002c-numbers-391"></a><a name="index-field-numbers-392"></a>
The number of a field does not need to be a constant.  Any expression in
the <span class="command">awk</span> language can be used after a <span class="samp">$</span> to refer to a
field.  The value of the expression specifies the field number.  If the
value is a string, rather than a number, it is converted to a number. 
Consider this example:

<pre class="example">     awk '{ print $NR }'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Recall that <code>NR</code> is the number of records read so far: one in the
first record, two in the second, etc.  So this example prints the first
field of the first record, the second field of the second record, and so
on.  For the twentieth record, field number 20 is printed; most likely,
the record has fewer than 20 fields, so this prints a blank line. 
Here is another example of using expressions as field numbers:

<pre class="example">     awk '{ print $(2*2) }' BBS-list
</pre>
   <p><span class="command">awk</span> evaluates the expression <span class="samp">(2*2)</span> and uses
its value as the number of the field to print.  The <span class="samp">*</span> sign
represents multiplication, so the expression <span class="samp">2*2</span> evaluates to four. 
The parentheses are used so that the multiplication is done before the
<span class="samp">$</span> operation; they are necessary whenever there is a binary
operator in the field-number expression.  This example, then, prints the
hours of operation (the fourth field) for every line of the file
<span class="file">BBS-list</span>.  (All of the <span class="command">awk</span> operators are listed, in
order of decreasing precedence, in
<a href="#Precedence">Precedence</a>.)

   <p>If the field number you compute is zero, you get the entire record. 
Thus, <span class="samp">$(2-2)</span> has the same value as <code>$0</code>.  Negative field
numbers are not allowed; trying to reference one usually terminates
the program.  (The POSIX standard does not define
what happens when you reference a negative field number.  <span class="command">gawk</span>
notices this and terminates your program.  Other <span class="command">awk</span>
implementations may behave differently.)

   <p>As mentioned in <a href="#Fields">Fields</a>,
<span class="command">awk</span> stores the current record's number of fields in the built-in
variable <code>NF</code> (also see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>).  The expression
<code>$NF</code> is not a special feature&mdash;it is the direct consequence of
evaluating <code>NF</code> and using its value as a field number.

<h3 class="section">3.4 Changing the Contents of a Field</h3>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE ficon -->
<p><a name="index-fields_002c-changing-contents-of-393"></a>The contents of a field, as seen by <span class="command">awk</span>, can be changed within an
<span class="command">awk</span> program; this changes what <span class="command">awk</span> perceives as the
current input record.  (The actual input is untouched; <span class="command">awk</span> <em>never</em>
modifies the input file.) 
Consider the following example and its output:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ nboxes = $3 ; $3 = $3 - 10
     &gt;        print nboxes, $3 }' inventory-shipped
     -| 25 15
     -| 32 22
     -| 24 14
     ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The program first saves the original value of field three in the variable
<code>nboxes</code>. 
The <span class="samp">-</span> sign represents subtraction, so this program reassigns
field three, <code>$3</code>, as the original value of field three minus ten:
<span class="samp">$3 - 10</span>.  (See <a href="#Arithmetic-Ops">Arithmetic Ops</a>.) 
Then it prints the original and new values for field three. 
(Someone in the warehouse made a consistent mistake while inventorying
the red boxes.)

   <p>For this to work, the text in field <code>$3</code> must make sense
as a number; the string of characters must be converted to a number
for the computer to do arithmetic on it.  The number resulting
from the subtraction is converted back to a string of characters that
then becomes field three. 
See <a href="#Conversion">Conversion</a>.

   <p>When the value of a field is changed (as perceived by <span class="command">awk</span>), the
text of the input record is recalculated to contain the new field where
the old one was.  In other words, <code>$0</code> changes to reflect the altered
field.  Thus, this program
prints a copy of the input file, with 10 subtracted from the second
field of each line:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ $2 = $2 - 10; print $0 }' inventory-shipped
     -| Jan 3 25 15 115
     -| Feb 5 32 24 226
     -| Mar 5 24 34 228
     ...
</pre>
   <p>It is also possible to also assign contents to fields that are out
of range.  For example:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ $6 = ($5 + $4 + $3 + $2)
     &gt;        print $6 }' inventory-shipped
     -| 168
     -| 297
     -| 301
     ...
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-adding_002c-fields-394"></a><a name="index-fields_002c-adding-395"></a>We've just created <code>$6</code>, whose value is the sum of fields
<code>$2</code>, <code>$3</code>, <code>$4</code>, and <code>$5</code>.  The <span class="samp">+</span> sign
represents addition.  For the file <span class="file">inventory-shipped</span>, <code>$6</code>
represents the total number of parcels shipped for a particular month.

   <p>Creating a new field changes <span class="command">awk</span>'s internal copy of the current
input record, which is the value of <code>$0</code>.  Thus, if you do <span class="samp">print $0</span>
after adding a field, the record printed includes the new field, with
the appropriate number of field separators between it and the previously
existing fields.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bOFS_007d-variable-396"></a><a name="index-output-field-separator_002c-See-_0040code_007bOFS_007d-variable-397"></a><a name="index-field-separators_002c-See-Also-_0040code_007bOFS_007d-398"></a>This recomputation affects and is affected by
<code>NF</code> (the number of fields; see <a href="#Fields">Fields</a>). 
For example, the value of <code>NF</code> is set to the number of the highest
field you create. 
The exact format of <code>$0</code> is also affected by a feature that has not been discussed yet:
the <dfn>output field separator</dfn>, <code>OFS</code>,
used to separate the fields (see <a href="#Output-Separators">Output Separators</a>).

   <p>Note, however, that merely <em>referencing</em> an out-of-range field
does <em>not</em> change the value of either <code>$0</code> or <code>NF</code>. 
Referencing an out-of-range field only produces an empty string.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     if ($(NF+1) != "")
         print "can't happen"
     else
         print "everything is normal"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">should print <span class="samp">everything is normal</span>, because <code>NF+1</code> is certain
to be out of range.  (See <a href="#If-Statement">If Statement</a>,
for more information about <span class="command">awk</span>'s <code>if-else</code> statements. 
See <a href="#Typing-and-Comparison">Typing and Comparison</a>,
for more information about the <span class="samp">!=</span> operator.)

   <p>It is important to note that making an assignment to an existing field
changes the
value of <code>$0</code> but does not change the value of <code>NF</code>,
even when you assign the empty string to a field.  For example:

<pre class="example">     $ echo a b c d | awk '{ OFS = ":"; $2 = ""
     &gt;                       print $0; print NF }'
     -| a::c:d
     -| 4
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The field is still there; it just has an empty value, denoted by
the two colons between <span class="samp">a</span> and <span class="samp">c</span>. 
This example shows what happens if you create a new field:

<pre class="example">     $ echo a b c d | awk '{ OFS = ":"; $2 = ""; $6 = "new"
     &gt;                       print $0; print NF }'
     -| a::c:d::new
     -| 6
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The intervening field, <code>$5</code>, is created with an empty value
(indicated by the second pair of adjacent colons),
and <code>NF</code> is updated with the value six.

<!-- FIXME: Verify that this is in POSIX -->
<p><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-_0040code_007bNF_007d-variable_002c-decrementing-399"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bNF_007d-variable_002c-decrementing-400"></a>Decrementing <code>NF</code> throws away the values of the fields
after the new value of <code>NF</code> and recomputes <code>$0</code>. 
(d.c.) 
Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     $ echo a b c d e f | awk '{ print "NF =", NF;
     &gt;                            NF = 3; print $0 }'
     -| NF = 6
     -| a b c
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-portability_002c-_0040code_007bNF_007d-variable_0040comma_007b_007d-decrementing-401"></a><strong>Caution:</strong> Some versions of <span class="command">awk</span> don't
rebuild <code>$0</code> when <code>NF</code> is decremented. Caveat emptor.

   <p>Finally, there are times when it is convenient to force
<span class="command">awk</span> to rebuild the entire record, using the current
value of the fields and <code>OFS</code>.  To do this, use the
seemingly innocuous assignment:

<pre class="example">     $1 = $1   # force record to be reconstituted
     print $0  # or whatever else with $0

   <p class="noindent">This forces <span class="command">awk</span> rebuild the record.  It does help
to add a comment, as we've shown here.

   <p>There is a flip side to the relationship between <code>$0</code> and
the fields.  Any assignment to <code>$0</code> causes the record to be
reparsed into fields using the <em>current</em> value of <code>FS</code>. 
This also applies to any built-in function that updates <code>$0</code>,
such as <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code>
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>).

<a name="index-fields_002c-separating-405"></a>The <dfn>field separator</dfn>, which is either a single character or a regular
expression, controls the way <span class="command">awk</span> splits an input record into fields. 
<span class="command">awk</span> scans the input record for character sequences that
match the separator; the fields themselves are the text between the matches.

   <p>In the examples that follow, we use the bullet symbol (&bull;) to
represent spaces in the output. 
If the field separator is <span class="samp">oo</span>, then the following line:

<pre class="example">     moo goo gai pan
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is split into three fields: <span class="samp">m</span>, <span class="samp">&bull;g</span>, and
<span class="samp">&bull;gai&bull;pan</span>. 
Note the leading spaces in the values of the second and third fields.

   <p><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-_0040command_007bawk_007d-uses-_0040code_007bFS_007d-not-_0040code_007bIFS_007d-406"></a>The field separator is represented by the built-in variable <code>FS</code>. 
Shell programmers take note:  <span class="command">awk</span> does <em>not</em> use the
name <code>IFS</code> that is used by the POSIX-compliant shells (such as
the Unix Bourne shell, <span class="command">sh</span>, or <span class="command">bash</span>).

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bFS_007d-variable_002c-changing-value-of-407"></a>The value of <code>FS</code> can be changed in the <span class="command">awk</span> program with the
assignment operator, <span class="samp">=</span> (see <a href="#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Ops</a>). 
Often the right time to do this is at the beginning of execution
before any input has been processed, so that the very first record
is read with the proper separator.  To do this, use the special
<code>BEGIN</code> pattern
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>). 
For example, here we set the value of <code>FS</code> to the string
<code>","</code>:

<pre class="example">     awk 'BEGIN { FS = "," } ; { print $2 }'
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern-408"></a>Given the input line:

<pre class="example">     John Q. Smith, 29 Oak St., Walamazoo, MI 42139
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">this <span class="command">awk</span> program extracts and prints the string
<span class="samp">&bull;29&bull;Oak&bull;St.</span>.

   <p><a name="index-field-separators_002c-choice-of-409"></a><a name="index-regular-expressions-as-field-separators-410"></a><a name="index-field-separators_002c-regular-expressions-as-411"></a>Sometimes the input data contains separator characters that don't
separate fields the way you thought they would.  For instance, the
person's name in the example we just used might have a title or
suffix attached, such as:

<pre class="example">     John Q. Smith, LXIX, 29 Oak St., Walamazoo, MI 42139
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The same program would extract <span class="samp">&bull;LXIX</span>, instead of
<span class="samp">&bull;29&bull;Oak&bull;St.</span>. 
If you were expecting the program to print the
address, you would be surprised.  The moral is to choose your data layout and
separator characters carefully to prevent such problems. 
(If the data is not in a form that is easy to process, perhaps you
can massage it first with a separate <span class="command">awk</span> program.)

   <p><a name="index-newlines_002c-as-field-separators-412"></a><a name="index-whitespace_002c-as-field-separators-413"></a>Fields are normally separated by whitespace sequences
(spaces, tabs, and newlines), not by single spaces.  Two spaces in a row do not
delimit an empty field.  The default value of the field separator <code>FS</code>
is a string containing a single space, <code>"&nbsp;"</code><!-- /@w -->.  If <span class="command">awk</span>
interpreted this value in the usual way, each space character would separate
fields, so two spaces in a row would make an empty field between them. 
The reason this does not happen is that a single space as the value of
<code>FS</code> is a special case&mdash;it is taken to specify the default manner
of delimiting fields.

   <p>If <code>FS</code> is any other single character, such as <code>","</code>, then
each occurrence of that character separates two fields.  Two consecutive
occurrences delimit an empty field.  If the character occurs at the
beginning or the end of the line, that too delimits an empty field.  The
space character is the only single character that does not follow these
rules.

<h4 class="subsection">3.5.1 Using Regular Expressions to Separate Fields</h4>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE regexpfs -->
<p><a name="index-regular-expressions_002c-as-field-separators-414"></a><!-- STARTOFRANGE fsregexp -->
<a name="index-field-separators_002c-regular-expressions-as-415"></a>The previous subsection
discussed the use of single characters or simple strings as the
value of <code>FS</code>. 
More generally, the value of <code>FS</code> may be a string containing any
regular expression.  In this case, each match in the record for the regular
expression separates fields.  For example, the assignment:

<pre class="example">     FS = ", \t"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">makes every area of an input line that consists of a comma followed by a
space and a TAB into a field separator.

   <p>For a less trivial example of a regular expression, try using
single spaces to separate fields the way single commas are used. 
<code>FS</code> can be set to <code>"[&nbsp;]"</code><!-- /@w --> (left bracket, space, right
bracket).  This regular expression matches a single space and nothing else
(see <a href="#Regexp">Regexp</a>).

   <p>There is an important difference between the two cases of <span class="samp">FS = "&nbsp;"<!-- /@w --></span>
(a single space) and <span class="samp">FS = "[&nbsp;\t\n]+"<!-- /@w --></span>
(a regular expression matching one or more spaces, tabs, or newlines). 
For both values of <code>FS</code>, fields are separated by <dfn>runs</dfn>
(multiple adjacent occurrences) of spaces, tabs,
and/or newlines.  However, when the value of <code>FS</code> is <code>"&nbsp;"</code><!-- /@w -->,
<span class="command">awk</span> first strips leading and trailing whitespace from
the record and then decides where the fields are. 
For example, the following pipeline prints <span class="samp">b</span>:

<pre class="example">     $ echo ' a b c d ' | awk '{ print $2 }'
     -| b
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">However, this pipeline prints <span class="samp">a</span> (note the extra spaces around
each letter):

<pre class="example">     $ echo ' a  b  c  d ' | awk 'BEGIN { FS = "[ \t\n]+" }
     &gt;                                  { print $2 }'
     -| a
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-null-strings-416"></a><a name="index-strings_002c-null-417"></a><a name="index-empty-strings_002c-See-null-strings-418"></a>In this case, the first field is <dfn>null</dfn> or empty.

   <p>The stripping of leading and trailing whitespace also comes into
play whenever <code>$0</code> is recomputed.  For instance, study this pipeline:

<pre class="example">     $ echo '   a b c d' | awk '{ print; $2 = $2; print }'
     -|    a b c d
     -| a b c d
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first <code>print</code> statement prints the record as it was read,
with leading whitespace intact.  The assignment to <code>$2</code> rebuilds
<code>$0</code> by concatenating <code>$1</code> through <code>$NF</code> together,
separated by the value of <code>OFS</code>.  Because the leading whitespace
was ignored when finding <code>$1</code>, it is not part of the new <code>$0</code>. 
Finally, the last <code>print</code> statement prints the new <code>$0</code>.

In this case, most versions of Unix <span class="command">awk</span> simply treat the entire record
as only having one field. 
(d.c.) 
In compatibility mode
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>),
if <code>FS</code> is the null string, then <span class="command">gawk</span> also
behaves this way.

<code>FS</code> can be set on the command line.  Use the <span class="option">-F</span> option to
do so.  For example:

<pre class="example">     awk -F, '<var>program</var>' <var>input-files</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">sets <code>FS</code> to the <span class="samp">,</span> character.  Notice that the option uses
an uppercase <span class="samp">F</span> instead of a lowercase <span class="samp">f</span>. The latter
option (<span class="option">-f</span>) specifies a file
containing an <span class="command">awk</span> program.  Case is significant in command-line
options:
the <span class="option">-F</span> and <span class="option">-f</span> options have nothing to do with each other. 
You can use both options at the same time to set the <code>FS</code> variable
<em>and</em> get an <span class="command">awk</span> program from a file.

   <p>The value used for the argument to <span class="option">-F</span> is processed in exactly the
same way as assignments to the built-in variable <code>FS</code>. 
Any special characters in the field separator must be escaped
appropriately.  For example, to use a <span class="samp">\</span> as the field separator
on the command line, you would have to type:

<pre class="example">     # same as FS = "\\"
     awk -F\\\\ '...' files ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005c_007d-_0028backslash_0029_002c-as-field-separators-430"></a><a name="index-backslash-_0028_0040code_007b_005c_007d_0029_002c-as-field-separators-431"></a>Because <span class="samp">\</span> is used for quoting in the shell, <span class="command">awk</span> sees
<span class="samp">-F\\</span>.  Then <span class="command">awk</span> processes the <span class="samp">\\</span> for escape
characters (see <a href="#Escape-Sequences">Escape Sequences</a>), finally yielding
a single <span class="samp">\</span> to use for the field separator.

<!-- @cindex historical features -->
<p>As a special case, in compatibility mode
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>),
if the argument to <span class="option">-F</span> is <span class="samp">t</span>, then <code>FS</code> is set to
the TAB character.  If you type <span class="samp">-F\t</span> at the
shell, without any quotes, the <span class="samp">\</span> gets deleted, so <span class="command">awk</span>
figures that you really want your fields to be separated with tabs and
not <span class="samp">t</span>s.  Use <span class="samp">-v FS="t"</span> or <span class="samp">-F"[t]"</span> on the command line
if you really do want to separate your fields with <span class="samp">t</span>s.

   <p>For example, let's use an <span class="command">awk</span> program file called <span class="file">baud.awk</span>
that contains the pattern <code>/300/</code> and the action <span class="samp">print $1</span>:

<pre class="example">     /300/   { print $1 }
</pre>
   <p>Let's also set <code>FS</code> to be the <span class="samp">-</span> character and run the
program on the file <span class="file">BBS-list</span>.  The following command prints a
list of the names of the bulletin boards that operate at 300 baud and
the first three digits of their phone numbers:

<!-- tweaked to make the tex output look better in @smallbook -->
<pre class="example">     $ awk -F- -f baud.awk BBS-list
     -| aardvark     555
     -| alpo
     -| barfly       555
     -| bites        555
     -| camelot      555
     -| core         555
     -| fooey        555
     -| foot         555
     -| macfoo       555
     -| sdace        555
     -| sabafoo      555
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note the second line of output.  The second line
in the original file looked like this:

<pre class="example">     alpo-net     555-3412     2400/1200/300     A
</pre>
   <p>The <span class="samp">-</span> as part of the system's name was used as the field
separator, instead of the <span class="samp">-</span> in the phone number that was
originally intended.  This demonstrates why you have to be careful in
choosing your field and record separators.

   <p><a name="index-Unix-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-password-files_0040comma_007b_007d-field-separators-and-432"></a>Perhaps the most common use of a single character as the field
separator occurs when processing the Unix system password file. 
On many Unix systems, each user has a separate entry in the system password
file, one line per user.  The information in these lines is separated
by colons.  The first field is the user's login name and the second is
the user's (encrypted or shadow) password.  A password file entry might look
like this:

   <p><a name="index-Robbins_002c-Arnold-433"></a>
<pre class="example">     arnold:xyzzy:2076:10:Arnold Robbins:/home/arnold:/bin/bash
</pre>
   <p>The following program searches the system password file and prints
the entries for users who have no password:

<pre class="example">     awk -F: '$2 == ""' /etc/passwd

<h4 class="subsection">3.5.4 Field-Splitting Summary</h4>

<p>It is important to remember that when you assign a string constant
as the value of <code>FS</code>, it undergoes normal <span class="command">awk</span> string
processing.  For example, with Unix <span class="command">awk</span> and <span class="command">gawk</span>,
the assignment <span class="samp">FS = "\.."</span> assigns the character string <code>".."</code>
to <code>FS</code> (the backslash is stripped).  This creates a regexp meaning
&ldquo;fields are separated by occurrences of any two characters.&rdquo;
If instead you want fields to be separated by a literal period followed
by any single character, use <span class="samp">FS = "\\.."</span>.

   <p>The following table summarizes how fields are split, based on the value
of <code>FS</code> (<span class="samp">==</span> means &ldquo;is equal to&rdquo;):

     <dl>
<dt><code>FS == " "</code><dd>Fields are separated by runs of whitespace.  Leading and trailing
whitespace are ignored.  This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>FS == </code><var>any other single character</var><dd>Fields are separated by each occurrence of the character.  Multiple
successive occurrences delimit empty fields, as do leading and
trailing occurrences. 
The character can even be a regexp metacharacter; it does not need
to be escaped.

     <br><dt><code>FS == </code><var>regexp</var><dd>Fields are separated by occurrences of characters that match <var>regexp</var>. 
Leading and trailing matches of <var>regexp</var> delimit empty fields.

     <br><dt><code>FS == ""</code><dd>Each individual character in the record becomes a separate field. 
(This is a <span class="command">gawk</span> extension; it is not specified by the
POSIX standard.)

<h4 class="subheading">Advanced Notes: Changing <code>FS</code> Does Not Affect the Fields</h4>

<p><a name="index-POSIX-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-field-separators-and-434"></a><a name="index-field-separators_002c-POSIX-and-435"></a>According to the POSIX standard, <span class="command">awk</span> is supposed to behave
as if each record is split into fields at the time it is read. 
In particular, this means that if you change the value of <code>FS</code>
after a record is read, the value of the fields (i.e., how they were split)
should reflect the old value of <code>FS</code>, not the new one.

   <p><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-field-separators-436"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bsed_007d-utility-437"></a><a name="index-stream-editors-438"></a>However, many implementations of <span class="command">awk</span> do not work this way.  Instead,
they defer splitting the fields until a field is actually
referenced.  The fields are split
using the <em>current</em> value of <code>FS</code>! 
(d.c.) 
This behavior can be difficult
to diagnose. The following example illustrates the difference
between the two methods. 
(The <span class="command">sed</span><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-18" name="fnd-18"><sup>18</sup></a>
command prints just the first line of <span class="file">/etc/passwd</span>.)

<pre class="example">     sed 1q /etc/passwd | awk '{ FS = ":" ; print $1 }'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which usually prints:

<pre class="example">     root
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">on an incorrect implementation of <span class="command">awk</span>, while <span class="command">gawk</span>

<h4 class="subheading">Advanced Notes: <code>FS</code> and <code>IGNORECASE</code></h4>

<p>The <code>IGNORECASE</code> variable
(see <a href="#User_002dmodified">User-modified</a>)
affects field splitting <em>only</em> when the value of <code>FS</code> is a regexp. 
It has no effect when <code>FS</code> is a single character, even if
that character is a letter.  Thus, in the following code:

<pre class="example">     FS = "c"
     IGNORECASE = 1
     $0 = "aCa"
     print $1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The output is <span class="samp">aCa</span>.  If you really want to split fields on an
alphabetic character while ignoring case, use a regexp that will
do it for you.  E.g., <span class="samp">FS = "[c]"</span>.  In this case, <code>IGNORECASE</code>
will take effect.

fixed-width fields with no distinctive field separator.  For example,
data of this nature arises in the input for old Fortran programs where
numbers are run together, or in the output of programs that did not
anticipate the use of their output as input for other programs.

   <p>An example of the latter is a table where all the columns are lined up by
the use of a variable number of spaces and <em>empty fields are just
spaces</em>.  Clearly, <span class="command">awk</span>'s normal field splitting based on <code>FS</code>
does not work well in this case.  Although a portable <span class="command">awk</span> program
can use a series of <code>substr</code> calls on <code>$0</code>
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>),
this is awkward and inefficient for a large number of fields.

between fields, you can specify the width as a separate field that is
subsequently ignored. 
It is a fatal error to supply a field width that is not a positive number. 
The following data is the output of the Unix <span class="command">w</span> utility.  It is useful
to illustrate the use of <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code>:

<pre class="example">      10:06pm  up 21 days, 14:04,  23 users

</pre>
   <p>Another (possibly more practical) example of fixed-width input data
is the input from a deck of balloting cards.  In some parts of
the United States, voters mark their choices by punching holes in computer
cards.  These cards are then processed to count the votes for any particular
candidate or on any particular issue.  Because a voter may choose not to
vote on some issue, any column on the card may be empty.  An <span class="command">awk</span>
program for processing such data could use the <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code> feature
to simplify reading the data.  (Of course, getting <span class="command">gawk</span> to run on
a system with card readers is another story!)

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-splitting-fields-and-445"></a>Assigning a value to <code>FS</code> causes <span class="command">gawk</span> to use
<code>FS</code> for field splitting again.  Use <span class="samp">FS = FS</span> to make this happen,
without having to know the current value of <code>FS</code>. 
In order to tell which kind of field splitting is in effect,
use <code>PROCINFO["FS"]</code>
(see <a href="#Auto_002dset">Auto-set</a>). 
The value is <code>"FS"</code> if regular field splitting is being used,
or it is <code>"FIELDWIDTHS"</code> if fixed-width field splitting is being used:

<pre class="example">     if (PROCINFO["FS"] == "FS")
         <var>regular field splitting</var> ...
     else
         <var>fixed-width field splitting</var> ...
</pre>
   <p>This information is useful when writing a function
that needs to temporarily change <code>FS</code> or <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code>,
read some records, and then restore the original settings
(see <a href="#Passwd-Functions">Passwd Functions</a>,
for an example of such a function).

<a name="index-files_002c-reading_002c-multiline-records-448"></a><a name="index-input_002c-files_002c-See-input-files-449"></a>In some databases, a single line cannot conveniently hold all the
information in one entry.  In such cases, you can use multiline
records.  The first step in doing this is to choose your data format.

   <p><a name="index-record-separators_002c-with-multiline-records-450"></a>One technique is to use an unusual character or string to separate
records.  For example, you could use the formfeed character (written
<span class="samp">\f</span> in <span class="command">awk</span>, as in C) to separate them, making each record
a page of the file.  To do this, just set the variable <code>RS</code> to
<code>"\f"</code> (a string containing the formfeed character).  Any
other character could equally well be used, as long as it won't be part
of the data in a record.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bRS_007d-variable_002c-multiline-records-and-451"></a>Another technique is to have blank lines separate records.  By a special
dispensation, an empty string as the value of <code>RS</code> indicates that
records are separated by one or more blank lines.  When <code>RS</code> is set
to the empty string, each record always ends at the first blank line
encountered.  The next record doesn't start until the first nonblank
line that follows.  No matter how many blank lines appear in a row, they
all act as one record separator. 
(Blank lines must be completely empty; lines that contain only
whitespace do not count.)

   <p><a name="index-leftmost-longest-match-452"></a><a name="index-matching_002c-leftmost-longest-453"></a>You can achieve the same effect as <span class="samp">RS = ""</span> by assigning the
string <code>"\n\n+"</code> to <code>RS</code>. This regexp matches the newline
at the end of the record and one or more blank lines after the record. 
In addition, a regular expression always matches the longest possible
sequence when there is a choice
(see <a href="#Leftmost-Longest">Leftmost Longest</a>). 
So the next record doesn't start until
the first nonblank line that follows&mdash;no matter how many blank lines
appear in a row, they are considered one record separator.

   <p><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-multiline-records-454"></a>There is an important difference between <span class="samp">RS = ""</span> and
<span class="samp">RS = "\n\n+"</span>. In the first case, leading newlines in the input
data file are ignored, and if a file ends without extra blank lines
after the last record, the final newline is removed from the record. 
In the second case, this special processing is not done. 
(d.c.)

   <p><a name="index-field-separators_002c-in-multiline-records-455"></a>Now that the input is separated into records, the second step is to
separate the fields in the record.  One way to do this is to divide each
of the lines into fields in the normal manner.  This happens by default
as the result of a special feature.  When <code>RS</code> is set to the empty
string, <em>and</em> <code>FS</code> is set to a single character,
the newline character <em>always</em> acts as a field separator. 
This is in addition to whatever field separations result from
<code>FS</code>.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-19" name="fnd-19"><sup>19</sup></a>

   <p>The original motivation for this special exception was probably to provide
useful behavior in the default case (i.e., <code>FS</code> is equal
to <code>"&nbsp;"</code><!-- /@w -->).  This feature can be a problem if you really don't
want the newline character to separate fields, because there is no way to
prevent it.  However, you can work around this by using the <code>split</code>
function to break up the record manually
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>). 
If you have a single character field separator, you can work around
the special feature in a different way, by making <code>FS</code> into a
regexp for that single character.  For example, if the field
separator is a percent character, instead of
<span class="samp">FS = "%"</span>, use <span class="samp">FS = "[%]"</span>.

   <p>Another way to separate fields is to
put each field on a separate line: to do this, just set the
variable <code>FS</code> to the string <code>"\n"</code>.  (This single
character separator matches a single newline.) 
A practical example of a data file organized this way might be a mailing
list, where each entry is separated by blank lines.  Consider a mailing
list in a file named <span class="file">addresses</span>, which looks like this:

<pre class="example">     Jane Doe
     123 Main Street
     Anywhere, SE 12345-6789
     
     John Smith
     456 Tree-lined Avenue
     Smallville, MW 98765-4321
     ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">A simple program to process this file is as follows:

<pre class="example">     # addrs.awk --- simple mailing list program
     
     # Records are separated by blank lines.
     # Each line is one field.
     BEGIN { RS = "" ; FS = "\n" }
     
     {
           print "Name is:", $1
           print "Address is:", $2
           print "City and State are:", $3
           print ""
     }
</pre>
   <p>Running the program produces the following output:

<pre class="example">     $ awk -f addrs.awk addresses
     -| Name is: Jane Doe
     -| Address is: 123 Main Street
     -| City and State are: Anywhere, SE 12345-6789
     -|
     -| Name is: John Smith
     -| Address is: 456 Tree-lined Avenue
     -| City and State are: Smallville, MW 98765-4321
     -|
     ...
</pre>
   <p>See <a href="#Labels-Program">Labels Program</a>, for a more realistic
program that deals with address lists. 
The following
table
summarizes how records are split, based on the
value of
<code>RS</code>:

     <dl>
<dt><code>RS == "\n"</code><dd>Records are separated by the newline character (<span class="samp">\n</span>).  In effect,
every line in the data file is a separate record, including blank lines. 
This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>RS == </code><var>any single character</var><dd>Records are separated by each occurrence of the character.  Multiple
successive occurrences delimit empty records.

     <br><dt><code>RS == ""</code><dd>Records are separated by runs of blank lines. 
When <code>FS</code> is a single character, then
the newline character
always serves as a field separator, in addition to whatever value
<code>FS</code> may have. Leading and trailing newlines in a file are ignored.

     <br><dt><code>RS == </code><var>regexp</var><dd>Records are separated by occurrences of characters that match <var>regexp</var>. 
Leading and trailing matches of <var>regexp</var> delimit empty records.

POSIX standard.)

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.1 Using <code>getline</code> with No Arguments</h4>

<p>The <code>getline</code> command can be used without arguments to read input
from the current input file.  All it does in this case is read the next
input record and split it up into fields.  This is useful if you've
finished processing the current record, but want to do some special
processing on the next record <em>right now</em>.  For example:

<pre class="example">     {
          if ((t = index($0, "/*")) != 0) {
               # value of `tmp' will be "" if t is 1
               tmp = substr($0, 1, t - 1)
               u = index(substr($0, t + 2), "*/")
               while (u == 0) {
                    if (getline &lt;= 0) {
                         m = "unexpected EOF or error"
                         m = (m ": " ERRNO)
                         print m &gt; "/dev/stderr"
                         exit
                    }
                    u = index($0, "*/")
               }
               # substr expression will be "" if */
               # occurred at end of line
               $0 = tmp substr($0, u + 2)
          }
          print $0
     }
</pre>
   <p>This <span class="command">awk</span> program deletes C-style comments (<span class="samp">/* ... 
*/</span>) from the input.  By replacing the <span class="samp">print $0</span> with other
statements, you could perform more complicated processing on the
decommented input, such as searching for matches of a regular
expression.  (This program has a subtle problem&mdash;it does not work if one
comment ends and another begins on the same line.)

   <p>This form of the <code>getline</code> command sets <code>NF</code>,
<code>NR</code>, <code>FNR</code>, and the value of <code>$0</code>.

   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> The new value of <code>$0</code> is used to test
the patterns of any subsequent rules.  The original value
of <code>$0</code> that triggered the rule that executed <code>getline</code>
is lost. 
By contrast, the <code>next</code> statement reads a new record
but immediately begins processing it normally, starting with the first
rule in the program.  See <a href="#Next-Statement">Next Statement</a>.

<p><a name="index-variables_002c-_0040code_007bgetline_007d-command-into_0040comma_007b_007d-using-462"></a>
You can use <span class="samp">getline </span><var>var</var> to read the next record from
<span class="command">awk</span>'s input into the variable <var>var</var>.  No other processing is
done. 
For example, suppose the next line is a comment or a special string,
and you want to read it without triggering
any rules.  This form of <code>getline</code> allows you to read that line
and store it in a variable so that the main
read-a-line-and-check-each-rule loop of <span class="command">awk</span> never sees it. 
The following example swaps every two lines of input:

<pre class="example">     {
          if ((getline tmp) &gt; 0) {
               print tmp
               print $0
          } else
               print $0
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It takes the following list:

<pre class="example">     wan
     tew
     free
     phore
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and produces these results:

<pre class="example">     tew
     wan
     phore
     free
</pre>
   <p>The <code>getline</code> command used in this way sets only the variables
<code>NR</code> and <code>FNR</code> (and of course, <var>var</var>).  The record is not
split into fields, so the values of the fields (including <code>$0</code>) and
the value of <code>NF</code> do not change.

For example, the following
program reads its input record from the file <span class="file">secondary.input</span> when it
encounters a first field with a value equal to 10 in the current input
file:

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.4 Using <code>getline</code> into a Variable from a File</h4>

<p><a name="index-variables_002c-_0040code_007bgetline_007d-command-into_0040comma_007b_007d-using-469"></a>
Use <span class="samp">getline </span><var>var</var><span class="samp"> &lt; </span><var>file</var> to read input
from the file
<var>file</var>, and put it in the variable <var>var</var>.  As above, <var>file</var>
is a string-valued expression that specifies the file from which to read.

   <p>In this version of <code>getline</code>, none of the built-in variables are
changed and the record is not split into fields.  The only variable
changed is <var>var</var>. 
For example, the following program copies all the input files to the
output, except for records that say <span class="samp">@include&nbsp;</span><var>filename</var><!-- /@w -->. 
Such a record is replaced by the contents of the file
<var>filename</var>:

<pre class="example">     {
          if (NF == 2 &amp;&amp; $1 == "@include") {
               while ((getline line &lt; $2) &gt; 0)
                    print line
               close($2)
          } else
               print
     }
</pre>
   <p>Note here how the name of the extra input file is not built into
the program; it is taken directly from the data, specifically from the second field on
the <span class="samp">@include</span> line.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bclose_007d-function-470"></a>The <code>close</code> function is called to ensure that if two identical
<span class="samp">@include</span> lines appear in the input, the entire specified file is
included twice. 
See <a href="#Close-Files-And-Pipes">Close Files And Pipes</a>.

   <p>One deficiency of this program is that it does not process nested
<span class="samp">@include</span> statements
(i.e., <span class="samp">@include</span> statements in included files)
the way a true macro preprocessor would. 
See <a href="#Igawk-Program">Igawk Program</a>, for a program
that does handle nested <span class="samp">@include</span> statements.

According to POSIX, <var>expression</var><span class="samp"> | getline</span> is ambiguous if
<var>expression</var> contains unparenthesized operators other than
<span class="samp">$</span>&mdash;for example, <span class="samp">"echo&nbsp;"<!-- /@w --> "date" | getline</span> is ambiguous
because the concatenation operator is not parenthesized.  You should
write it as <span class="samp">("echo&nbsp;"<!-- /@w --> "date") | getline</span> if you want your program
to be portable to other <span class="command">awk</span> implementations.

   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> Unfortunately, <span class="command">gawk</span> has not been consistent in its treatment
of a construct like <span class="samp">"echo&nbsp;"<!-- /@w --> "date" | getline</span>. Up to and including
version 3.1.1 of <span class="command">gawk</span>, it was treated as
<span class="samp">("echo&nbsp;"<!-- /@w --> "date") | getline</span>. 
(This how Unix <span class="command">awk</span> behaves.) 
From 3.1.2 through 3.1.5, it was treated as
<span class="samp">"echo&nbsp;"<!-- /@w --> ("date" | getline)</span>. 
(This is how <span class="command">mawk</span> behaves.) 
Starting with version 3.1.6, the earlier behavior was reinstated. 
In short, <em>always</em> use explicit parentheses, and then you won't
have to worry.

Input into <code>getline</code> from a pipe is a one-way operation. 
The command that is started with <var>command</var><span class="samp"> | getline</span> only
sends data <em>to</em> your <span class="command">awk</span> program.

   <p>On occasion, you might want to send data to another program
for processing and then read the results back. 
<span class="command">gawk</span> allows you to start a <dfn>coprocess</dfn>, with which two-way
communications are possible.  This is done with the <span class="samp">|&amp;</span>
operator. 
Typically, you write data to the coprocess first and then
read results back, as shown in the following:

<pre class="example">     print "<var>some query</var>" |&amp; "db_server"
     "db_server" |&amp; getline
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which sends a query to <span class="command">db_server</span> and then reads the results.

   <p>The values of <code>NR</code> and
<code>FNR</code> are not changed,
because the main input stream is not used. 
However, the record is split into fields in
the normal manner, thus changing the values of <code>$0</code>, of the other fields,
and of <code>NF</code>.

   <p>Coprocesses are an advanced feature. They are discussed here only because
this is the section on <code>getline</code>. 
See <a href="#Two_002dway-I_002fO">Two-way I/O</a>,
where coprocesses are discussed in more detail.

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.9 Points to Remember About <code>getline</code></h4>

<p>Here are some miscellaneous points about <code>getline</code> that
you should bear in mind:

     <ul>
<li>When <code>getline</code> changes the value of <code>$0</code> and <code>NF</code>,
<span class="command">awk</span> does <em>not</em> automatically jump to the start of the
program and start testing the new record against every pattern. 
However, the new record is tested against any subsequent rules.

     <p><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-implementation-limitations-489"></a><a name="index-implementation-issues_002c-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-limits-490"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-implementations_002c-limits-491"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-implementation-issues_002c-limits-492"></a><li>Many <span class="command">awk</span> implementations limit the number of pipelines that an <span class="command">awk</span>
program may have open to just one.  In <span class="command">gawk</span>, there is no such limit. 
You can open as many pipelines (and coprocesses) as the underlying operating
system permits.

     <p><a name="index-side-effects_002c-_0040code_007bFILENAME_007d-variable-493"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bFILENAME_007d-variable_002c-_0040code_007bgetline_007d_0040comma_007b_007d-setting-with-494"></a><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-_0040code_007bFILENAME_007d-variable-495"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetline_007d-command_002c-_0040code_007bFILENAME_007d-variable-and-496"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern_002c-_0040code_007bgetline_007d-and-497"></a><li>An interesting side effect occurs if you use <code>getline</code> without a
redirection inside a <code>BEGIN</code> rule. Because an unredirected <code>getline</code>
reads from the command-line data files, the first <code>getline</code> command
causes <span class="command">awk</span> to set the value of <code>FILENAME</code>. Normally,
<code>FILENAME</code> does not have a value inside <code>BEGIN</code> rules, because you
have not yet started to process the command-line data files. 
(d.c.) 
(See <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>,
also see <a href="#Auto_002dset">Auto-set</a>.)

     <li>Using <code>FILENAME</code> with <code>getline</code>
(<span class="samp">getline &lt; FILENAME</span>)
is likely to be a source for
confusion.  <span class="command">awk</span> opens a separate input stream from the
current input file.  However, by not using a variable, <code>$0</code>
and <code>NR</code> are still updated.  If you're doing this, it's
probably by accident, and you should reconsider what it is you're
trying to accomplish.

<h3 class="section">4.1 The <code>print</code> Statement</h3>

<p>The <code>print</code> statement is used to produce output with simple, standardized
formatting.  Specify only the strings or numbers to print, in a
list separated by commas.  They are output, separated by single spaces,
followed by a newline.  The statement looks like this:

<pre class="example">     print <var>item1</var>, <var>item2</var>, ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The entire list of items may be optionally enclosed in parentheses.  The
parentheses are necessary if any of the item expressions uses the <span class="samp">&gt;</span>
relational operator; otherwise it could be confused with a redirection
(see <a href="#Redirection">Redirection</a>).

   <p>The items to print can be constant strings or numbers, fields of the
current record (such as <code>$1</code>), variables, or any <span class="command">awk</span>
expression.  Numeric values are converted to strings and then printed.

   <p><a name="index-records_002c-printing-503"></a><a name="index-lines_002c-blank_002c-printing-504"></a><a name="index-text_002c-printing-505"></a>The simple statement <span class="samp">print</span> with no items is equivalent to
<span class="samp">print $0</span>: it prints the entire current record.  To print a blank
line, use <span class="samp">print ""</span>, where <code>""</code> is the empty string. 
To print a fixed piece of text, use a string constant, such as
<code>"Don't&nbsp;Panic"</code><!-- /@w -->, as one item.  If you forget to use the
double-quote characters, your text is taken as an <span class="command">awk</span>
expression, and you will probably get an error.  Keep in mind that a
space is printed between any two items.

<h3 class="section">4.2 Examples of <code>print</code> Statements</h3>

<p>Each <code>print</code> statement makes at least one line of output.  However, it
isn't limited to only one line.  If an item value is a string that contains a
newline, the newline is output along with the rest of the string.  A
single <code>print</code> statement can make any number of lines this way.

   <p><a name="index-newlines_002c-printing-506"></a>The following is an example of printing a string that contains embedded newlines
(the <span class="samp">\n</span> is an escape sequence, used to represent the newline
character; see <a href="#Escape-Sequences">Escape Sequences</a>):

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN { print "line one\nline two\nline three" }'
     -| line one
     -| line two
     -| line three
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-fields_002c-printing-507"></a>The next example, which is run on the <span class="file">inventory-shipped</span> file,
prints the first two fields of each input record, with a space between
them:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ print $1, $2 }' inventory-shipped
     -| Jan 13
     -| Feb 15
     -| Mar 15
     ...
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bprint_007d-statement_002c-commas_002c-omitting-508"></a><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-_0040code_007bprint_007d-statement_0040comma_007b_007d-omitting-commas-509"></a>A common mistake in using the <code>print</code> statement is to omit the comma
between two items.  This often has the effect of making the items run
together in the output, with no space.  The reason for this is that
juxtaposing two string expressions in <span class="command">awk</span> means to concatenate
them.  Here is the same program, without the comma:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ print $1 $2 }' inventory-shipped
     -| Jan13
     -| Feb15
     -| Mar15
     ...
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern_002c-headings_0040comma_007b_007d-adding-510"></a>To someone unfamiliar with the <span class="file">inventory-shipped</span> file, neither
example's output makes much sense.  A heading line at the beginning
would make it clearer.  Let's add some headings to our table of months
(<code>$1</code>) and green crates shipped (<code>$2</code>).  We do this using the
<code>BEGIN</code> pattern
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>)
so that the headings are only printed once:

<pre class="example">     awk 'BEGIN {  print "Month Crates"
                   print "----- ------" }
                {  print $1, $2 }' inventory-shipped
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When run, the program prints the following:

<pre class="example">     Month Crates
     ----- ------
     Jan 13
     Feb 15
     Mar 15
     ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The only problem, however, is that the headings and the table data
don't line up!  We can fix this by printing some spaces between the
two fields:

<pre class="example">     awk 'BEGIN { print "Month Crates"
                  print "----- ------" }
                { print $1, "     ", $2 }' inventory-shipped
</pre>

complicated when there are many columns to fix.  Counting spaces for two
or three columns is simple, but any more than this can take up
a lot of time. This is why the <code>printf</code> statement was
created (see <a href="#Printf">Printf</a>);
one of its specialties is lining up columns of data.

<b>NOTE:</b> You can continue either a <code>print</code> or

<h3 class="section">4.3 Output Separators</h3>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bOFS_007d-variable-515"></a>As mentioned previously, a <code>print</code> statement contains a list
of items separated by commas.  In the output, the items are normally
separated by single spaces.  However, this doesn't need to be the case;
a single space is only the default.  Any string of
characters may be used as the <dfn>output field separator</dfn> by setting the
built-in variable <code>OFS</code>.  The initial value of this variable
is the string <code>"&nbsp;"</code><!-- /@w -->&mdash;that is, a single space.

   <p>The output from an entire <code>print</code> statement is called an
<dfn>output record</dfn>.  Each <code>print</code> statement outputs one output
record, and then outputs a string called the <dfn>output record separator</dfn>
(or <code>ORS</code>).  The initial
value of <code>ORS</code> is the string <code>"\n"</code>; i.e., a newline
character.  Thus, each <code>print</code> statement normally makes a separate line.

   <p><a name="index-output_002c-records-516"></a><a name="index-output-record-separator_002c-See-_0040code_007bORS_007d-variable-517"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bORS_007d-variable-518"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern_002c-_0040code_007bOFS_007d_002f_0040code_007bORS_007d-variables_002c-assigning-values-to-519"></a>In order to change how output fields and records are separated, assign
new values to the variables <code>OFS</code> and <code>ORS</code>.  The usual
place to do this is in the <code>BEGIN</code> rule
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>), so
that it happens before any input is processed.  It can also be done
with assignments on the command line, before the names of the input
files, or using the <span class="option">-v</span> command-line option
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>). 
The following example prints the first and second fields of each input
record, separated by a semicolon, with a blank line added after each
newline:

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN { OFS = ";"; ORS = "\n\n" }
     &gt;            { print $1, $2 }' BBS-list
     -| aardvark;555-5553
     -|
     -| alpo-net;555-3412
     -|
     -| barfly;555-7685
     ...
</pre>
   <p>If the value of <code>ORS</code> does not contain a newline, the program's output
is run together on a single line.

<p><a name="index-numeric_002c-output-format-520"></a><a name="index-formats_0040comma_007b_007d-numeric-output-521"></a>When the <code>print</code> statement is used to print numeric values,
<span class="command">awk</span> internally converts the number to a string of characters
and prints that string.  <span class="command">awk</span> uses the <code>sprintf</code> function
to do this conversion
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>). 
For now, it suffices to say that the <code>sprintf</code>
function accepts a <dfn>format specification</dfn> that tells it how to format
numbers (or strings), and that there are a number of different ways in which
numbers can be formatted.  The different format specifications are discussed
more fully in
<a href="#Control-Letters">Control Letters</a>.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bsprintf_007d-function-522"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bOFMT_007d-variable-523"></a><a name="index-output_002c-format-specifier_0040comma_007b_007d-_0040code_007bOFMT_007d-524"></a>The built-in variable <code>OFMT</code> contains the default format specification
that <code>print</code> uses with <code>sprintf</code> when it wants to convert a
number to a string for printing. 
The default value of <code>OFMT</code> is <code>"%.6g"</code>. 
The way <code>print</code> prints numbers can be changed
by supplying different format specifications
as the value of <code>OFMT</code>, as shown in the following example:

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN {
     &gt;   OFMT = "%.0f"  # print numbers as integers (rounds)
     &gt;   print 17.23, 17.54 }'
     -| 17 18

if <code>OFMT</code> contains anything but a floating-point conversion specification.

<code>printf</code> can be used to
specify the width to use for each item, as well as various
formatting choices for numbers (such as what output base to use, whether to
print an exponent, whether to print a sign, and how many digits to print
after the decimal point).  This is done by supplying a string, called
the <dfn>format string</dfn>, that controls how and where to print the other
arguments.

<h4 class="subsection">4.5.1 Introduction to the <code>printf</code> Statement</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bprintf_007d-statement_002c-syntax-of-531"></a>A simple <code>printf</code> statement looks like this:

<pre class="example">     printf <var>format</var>, <var>item1</var>, <var>item2</var>, ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The entire list of arguments may optionally be enclosed in parentheses.  The
parentheses are necessary if any of the item expressions use the <span class="samp">&gt;</span>
relational operator; otherwise, it can be confused with a redirection
(see <a href="#Redirection">Redirection</a>).

   <p><a name="index-format-strings-532"></a>The difference between <code>printf</code> and <code>print</code> is the <var>format</var>
argument.  This is an expression whose value is taken as a string; it
specifies how to output each of the other arguments.  It is called the
<dfn>format string</dfn>.

   <p>The format string is very similar to that in the ISO C library function
<code>printf</code>.  Most of <var>format</var> is text to output verbatim. 
Scattered among this text are <dfn>format specifiers</dfn>&mdash;one per item. 
Each format specifier says to output the next item in the argument list
at that place in the format.

   <p>The <code>printf</code> statement does not automatically append a newline
to its output.  It outputs only what the format string specifies. 
So if a newline is needed, you must include one in the format string. 
The output separator variables <code>OFS</code> and <code>ORS</code> have no effect
on <code>printf</code> statements. For example:

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN {
     &gt;    ORS = "\nOUCH!\n"; OFS = "+"
     &gt;    msg = "Dont Panic!"
     &gt;    printf "%s\n", msg
     &gt; }'
     -| Dont Panic!
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, neither the <span class="samp">+</span> nor the <span class="samp">OUCH</span> appear when
the message is printed.

A format specifier starts with the character <span class="samp">%</span> and ends with
a <dfn>format-control letter</dfn>&mdash;it tells the <code>printf</code> statement
how to output one item.  The format-control letter specifies what <em>kind</em>
of value to print.  The rest of the format specifier is made up of
optional <dfn>modifiers</dfn> that control <em>how</em> to print the value, such as
the field width.  Here is a list of the format-control letters:

     <dl>
<dt><code>%c</code><dd>This prints a number as an ASCII character; thus, <span class="samp">printf "%c",
65</span> outputs the letter <span class="samp">A</span>. (The output for a string value is
the first character of the string.)

     <br><dt><code>%d</code><span class="roman">,</span><code> %i</code><dd>These are equivalent; they both print a decimal integer. 
(The <span class="samp">%i</span> specification is for compatibility with ISO C.)

     <br><dt><code>%e</code><span class="roman">,</span><code> %E</code><dd>These print a number in scientific (exponential) notation;
for example:

     <pre class="example">          printf "%4.3e\n", 1950
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">prints <span class="samp">1.950e+03</span>, with a total of four significant figures, three of
which follow the decimal point. 
(The <span class="samp">4.3</span> represents two modifiers,
discussed in the next subsection.) 
<span class="samp">%E</span> uses <span class="samp">E</span> instead of <span class="samp">e</span> in the output.

     <br><dt><code>%f</code><dd>This prints a number in floating-point notation. 
For example:

     <pre class="example">          printf "%4.3f", 1950
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">prints <span class="samp">1950.000</span>, with a total of four significant figures, three of
which follow the decimal point. 
(The <span class="samp">4.3</span> represents two modifiers,
discussed in the next subsection.)

     <p>On systems supporting IEEE 754 floating point format, values
representing negative
infinity are formatted as
<span class="samp">-inf</span> or <span class="samp">-infinity</span>,
and positive infinity as
<span class="samp">inf</span> and <span class="samp">infinity</span>. 
The special &ldquo;not a number&rdquo; value formats as <span class="samp">-nan</span> or <span class="samp">nan</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%F</code><dd>Like <code>%f</code> but the infinity and &ldquo;not a number&rdquo; values are spelled
using uppercase letters.

     <p>The <code>%F</code> format is a POSIX extension to ISO C; not all systems
support it.  On those that don't, <span class="command">gawk</span> uses <code>%f</code> instead.

     <br><dt><code>%g</code><span class="roman">,</span><code> %G</code><dd>These print a number in either scientific notation or in floating-point
notation, whichever uses fewer characters; if the result is printed in
scientific notation, <span class="samp">%G</span> uses <span class="samp">E</span> instead of <span class="samp">e</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%o</code><dd>This prints an unsigned octal integer.

     <br><dt><code>%s</code><dd>This prints a string.

     <br><dt><code>%u</code><dd>This prints an unsigned decimal integer. 
(This format is of marginal use, because all numbers in <span class="command">awk</span>
are floating-point; it is provided primarily for compatibility with C.)

     <br><dt><code>%x</code><span class="roman">,</span><code> %X</code><dd>These print an unsigned hexadecimal integer;
<span class="samp">%X</span> uses the letters <span class="samp">A</span> through <span class="samp">F</span>
instead of <span class="samp">a</span> through <span class="samp">f</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%%</code><dd>This isn't a format-control letter, but it does have meaning&mdash;the
sequence <span class="samp">%%</span> outputs one <span class="samp">%</span>; it does not consume an
argument and it ignores any modifiers. 
</dl>

<b>NOTE:</b> When using the integer format-control letters for values that are
outside the range of the widest C integer type, <span class="command">gawk</span> switches to
the <span class="samp">%g</span> format specifier. If <span class="option">--lint</span> is provided on the
command line (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>), <span class="command">gawk</span>
warns about this.  Other versions of <span class="command">awk</span> may print invalid

how much of the item's value is printed, as well as how much space it gets. 
The modifiers come between the <span class="samp">%</span> and the format-control letter. 
We will use the bullet symbol &ldquo;&bull;&rdquo; in the following examples to
represent
spaces in the output. Here are the possible modifiers, in the order in
which they may appear:

     
<a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-_0040code_007bprint_007d_002f_0040code_007bprintf_007d-statements-539"></a>

Normally, format specifications are applied to arguments in the order
given in the format string.  With a positional specifier, the format
specification is applied to a specific argument, instead of what
would be the next argument in the list.  Positional specifiers begin
counting with one. Thus:

     <pre class="example">          printf "%s %s\n", "don't", "panic"
          printf "%2$s %1$s\n", "panic", "don't"
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">prints the famous friendly message twice.

     <p>At first glance, this feature doesn't seem to be of much use. 
It is in fact a <span class="command">gawk</span> extension, intended for use in translating
messages at runtime. 
See <a href="#Printf-Ordering">Printf Ordering</a>,
which describes how and why to use positional specifiers. 
For now, we will not use them.

     <br><dt><code>-</code><dd>The minus sign, used before the width modifier (see later on in
this table),
says to left-justify
the argument within its specified width.  Normally, the argument
is printed right-justified in the specified width.  Thus:

     <pre class="example">          printf "%-4s", "foo"
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">prints <span class="samp">foo&bull;</span>.

     <br><dt><var>space</var><dd>For numeric conversions, prefix positive values with a space and
negative values with a minus sign.

     <br><dt><code>+</code><dd>The plus sign, used before the width modifier (see later on in
this table),
says to always supply a sign for numeric conversions, even if the data
to format is positive. The <span class="samp">+</span> overrides the space modifier.

     <br><dt><code>#</code><dd>Use an &ldquo;alternate form&rdquo; for certain control letters. 
For <span class="samp">%o</span>, supply a leading zero. 
For <span class="samp">%x</span> and <span class="samp">%X</span>, supply a leading <span class="samp">0x</span> or <span class="samp">0X</span> for
a nonzero result. 
For <span class="samp">%e</span>, <span class="samp">%E</span>, and <span class="samp">%f</span>, the result always contains a
decimal point. 
For <span class="samp">%g</span> and <span class="samp">%G</span>, trailing zeros are not removed from the result.

     <p><a name="index-dark-corner-542"></a><br><dt><code>0</code><dd>A leading <span class="samp">0</span> (zero) acts as a flag that indicates that output should be
padded with zeros instead of spaces. 
This applies even to non-numeric output formats. 
(d.c.) 
This flag only has an effect when the field width is wider than the
value to print.

     <br><dt><code>'</code><dd>A single quote or apostrophe character is a POSIX extension to ISO C. 
It indicates that the integer part of a floating point value, or the
entire part of an integer decimal value, should have a thousands-separator
character in it.  This only works in locales that support such characters. 
For example:

     <pre class="example">          $ <kbd>cat thousands.awk</kbd>          <i>Show source program</i>
          -| BEGIN { printf "%'d\n", 1234567 }

          $ <kbd>LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 gawk -f thousands.awk</kbd>
          -| 1,234,567                 <i>Results in US English UTF locale</i>

     <br><dt><var>width</var><dd>This is a number specifying the desired minimum width of a field.  Inserting any
number between the <span class="samp">%</span> sign and the format-control character forces the
field to expand to this width.  The default way to do this is to
pad with spaces on the left.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          printf "%4s", "foo"
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">prints <span class="samp">&bull;foo</span>.

     <p>The value of <var>width</var> is a minimum width, not a maximum.  If the item
value requires more than <var>width</var> characters, it can be as wide as
necessary.  Thus, the following:

     <pre class="example">          printf "%4s", "foobar"
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">prints <span class="samp">foobar</span>.

     <p>Preceding the <var>width</var> with a minus sign causes the output to be
padded with spaces on the right, instead of on the left.

     <br><dt><code>.</code><var>prec</var><dd>A period followed by an integer constant
specifies the precision to use when printing. 
The meaning of the precision varies by control letter:

          <dl>
<dt><code>%e</code>, <code>%E</code>, <code>%f</code><dd>Number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

          <br><dt><code>%g</code>, <code>%G</code><dd>Maximum number of significant digits.

          <br><dt><code>%d</code>, <code>%i</code>, <code>%o</code>, <code>%u</code>, <code>%x</code>, <code>%X</code><dd>Minimum number of digits to print.

          <br><dt><code>%s</code><dd>Maximum number of characters from the string that should print. 
</dl>

     <p>Thus, the following:

     <pre class="example">          printf "%.4s", "foobar"
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">prints <span class="samp">foob</span>. 
</dl>

   <p>The C library <code>printf</code>'s dynamic <var>width</var> and <var>prec</var>
capability (for example, <code>"%*.*s"</code>) is supported.  Instead of
supplying explicit <var>width</var> and/or <var>prec</var> values in the format
string, they are passed in the argument list.  For example:

<pre class="example">     w = 5
     p = 3
     s = "abcdefg"
     printf "%*.*s\n", w, p, s
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is exactly equivalent to:

<pre class="example">     s = "abcdefg"
     printf "%5.3s\n", s
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Both programs output <span class="samp">&bull;&bull;abc<!-- /@w --></span>. 
Earlier versions of <span class="command">awk</span> did not support this capability. 
If you must use such a version, you may simulate this feature by using
concatenation to build up the format string, like so:

<pre class="example">     w = 5
     p = 3
     s = "abcdefg"
     printf "%" w "." p "s\n", s
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is not particularly easy to read but it does work.

<h4 class="subsection">4.5.4 Examples Using <code>printf</code></h4>

<p>The following is a simple example of
how to use <code>printf</code> to make an aligned table:

<pre class="example">     awk '{ printf "%-10s %s\n", $1, $2 }' BBS-list
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This command
prints the names of the bulletin boards (<code>$1</code>) in the file
<span class="file">BBS-list</span> as a string of 10 characters that are left-justified.  It also
prints the phone numbers (<code>$2</code>) next on the line.  This
produces an aligned two-column table of names and phone numbers,
as shown here:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ printf "%-10s %s\n", $1, $2 }' BBS-list
     -| aardvark   555-5553
     -| alpo-net   555-3412
     -| barfly     555-7685
     -| bites      555-1675
     -| camelot    555-0542
     -| core       555-2912
     -| fooey      555-1234
     -| foot       555-6699
     -| macfoo     555-6480
     -| sdace      555-3430
     -| sabafoo    555-2127
</pre>
   <p>In this case, the phone numbers had to be printed as strings because
the numbers are separated by a dash.  Printing the phone numbers as
numbers would have produced just the first three digits: <span class="samp">555</span>. 
This would have been pretty confusing.

   <p>It wasn't necessary to specify a width for the phone numbers because
they are last on their lines.  They don't need to have spaces
after them.

   <p>The table could be made to look even nicer by adding headings to the
tops of the columns.  This is done using the <code>BEGIN</code> pattern
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>)
so that the headers are only printed once, at the beginning of
the <span class="command">awk</span> program:

<pre class="example">     awk 'BEGIN { print "Name      Number"
                  print "----      ------" }
          { printf "%-10s %s\n", $1, $2 }' BBS-list
</pre>
   <p>The above example mixed <code>print</code> and <code>printf</code> statements in
the same program.  Using just <code>printf</code> statements can produce the
same results:

<pre class="example">     awk 'BEGIN { printf "%-10s %s\n", "Name", "Number"
                  printf "%-10s %s\n", "----", "------" }
          { printf "%-10s %s\n", $1, $2 }' BBS-list
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Printing each column heading with the same format specification
used for the column elements ensures that the headings
are aligned just like the columns.

   <p>The fact that the same format specification is used three times can be
emphasized by storing it in a variable, like this:

<pre class="example">     awk 'BEGIN { format = "%-10s %s\n"
                  printf format, "Name", "Number"
                  printf format, "----", "------" }
          { printf format, $1, $2 }' BBS-list
</pre>
   <!-- !!! exercise -->
<p>At this point, it would be a worthwhile exercise to use the
<code>printf</code> statement to line up the headings and table data for the
<span class="file">inventory-shipped</span> example that was covered earlier in the section
on the <code>print</code> statement
(see <a href="#Print">Print</a>).

<h3 class="section">4.6 Redirecting Output of <code>print</code> and <code>printf</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-output-redirection-545"></a><a name="index-redirection-of-output-546"></a>So far, the output from <code>print</code> and <code>printf</code> has gone
to the standard
output, usually the terminal.  Both <code>print</code> and <code>printf</code> can
also send their output to other places. 
This is called <dfn>redirection</dfn>.

   <p>A redirection appears after the <code>print</code> or <code>printf</code> statement. 
Redirections in <span class="command">awk</span> are written just like redirections in shell
commands, except that they are written inside the <span class="command">awk</span> program.

<!-- the commas here are part of the see also -->
<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bprint_007d-statement_002c-See-Also-redirection_002c-of-output-547"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bprintf_007d-statement_002c-See-Also-redirection_002c-of-output-548"></a>There are four forms of output redirection: output to a file, output
appended to a file, output through a pipe to another command, and output
to a coprocess.  They are all shown for the <code>print</code> statement,
but they work identically for <code>printf</code>:

     
<a name="index-_0040code_007b_003e_007d-_0028right-angle-bracket_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_003e_007d-operator-_0028I_002fO_0029-549"></a>

<a name="index-operators_002c-input_002foutput-551"></a>
<dl><dt><code>print </code><var>items</var><code> &gt; </code><var>output-file</var><dd>This type of redirection prints the items into the output file named
<var>output-file</var>.  The file name <var>output-file</var> can be any
expression.  Its value is changed to a string and then used as a
file name (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>).

     <p>When this type of redirection is used, the <var>output-file</var> is erased
before the first output is written to it.  Subsequent writes to the same
<var>output-file</var> do not erase <var>output-file</var>, but append to it. 
(This is different from how you use redirections in shell scripts.) 
If <var>output-file</var> does not exist, it is created.  For example, here
is how an <span class="command">awk</span> program can write a list of BBS names to one
file named <span class="file">name-list</span>, and a list of phone numbers to another file
named <span class="file">phone-list</span>:

     <pre class="example">          $ awk '{ print $2 &gt; "phone-list"
          &gt;        print $1 &gt; "name-list" }' BBS-list
          $ cat phone-list
          -| 555-5553
          -| 555-3412
          ...
          $ cat name-list
          -| aardvark
          -| alpo-net
          ...
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Each output file contains one name or number per line.

single-<span class="samp">&gt;</span> redirection is that the old contents (if any) of
<var>output-file</var> are not erased.  Instead, the <span class="command">awk</span> output is
appended to the file. 
If <var>output-file</var> does not exist, then it is created.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_007c_007d-_0028vertical-bar_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_007c_007d-operator-_0028I_002fO_0029-554"></a><a name="index-pipes_002c-output-555"></a><a name="index-output_002c-pipes-556"></a><br><dt><code>print </code><var>items</var><code> | </code><var>command</var><dd>It is also possible to send output to another program through a pipe
instead of into a file.   This type of redirection opens a pipe to
<var>command</var>, and writes the values of <var>items</var> through this pipe
to another process created to execute <var>command</var>.

     <p>The redirection argument <var>command</var> is actually an <span class="command">awk</span>
expression.  Its value is converted to a string whose contents give
the shell command to be run.  For example, the following produces two
files, one unsorted list of BBS names, and one list sorted in reverse
alphabetical order:

     <pre class="example">          awk '{ print $1 &gt; "names.unsorted"
                 command = "sort -r &gt; names.sorted"
                 print $1 | command }' BBS-list
     </pre>
     <p>The unsorted list is written with an ordinary redirection, while
the sorted list is written by piping through the <span class="command">sort</span> utility.

     <p>The next example uses redirection to mail a message to the mailing
list <span class="samp">bug-system</span>.  This might be useful when trouble is encountered
in an <span class="command">awk</span> script run periodically for system maintenance:

     <pre class="example">          report = "mail bug-system"
          print "Awk script failed:", $0 | report
          m = ("at record number " FNR " of " FILENAME)
          print m | report
          close(report)
     </pre>
     <p>The message is built using string concatenation and saved in the variable
<code>m</code>.  It's then sent down the pipeline to the <span class="command">mail</span> program. 
(The parentheses group the items to concatenate&mdash;see
<a href="#Concatenation">Concatenation</a>.)

     <p>The <code>close</code> function is called here because it's a good idea to close
the pipe as soon as all the intended output has been sent to it. 
See <a href="#Close-Files-And-Pipes">Close Files And Pipes</a>,
for more information.

     <p>This example also illustrates the use of a variable to represent
a <var>file</var> or <var>command</var>&mdash;it is not necessary to always
use a string constant.  Using a variable is generally a good idea,
because (if you mean to refer to that same file or command)
<span class="command">awk</span> requires that the string value be spelled identically
every time.

The difference between this and the
single-<span class="samp">|</span> redirection is that the output from <var>command</var>
can be read with <code>getline</code>. 
Thus <var>command</var> is a <dfn>coprocess</dfn>, which works together with,
but subsidiary to, the <span class="command">awk</span> program.

     <p>This feature is a <span class="command">gawk</span> extension, and is not available in

See <a href="#Getline_002fCoprocess">Getline/Coprocess</a>,

   <p>Redirecting output using <span class="samp">&gt;</span>, <span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span>, <span class="samp">|</span>, or <span class="samp">|&amp;</span>
asks the system to open a file, pipe, or coprocess only if the particular
<var>file</var> or <var>command</var> you specify has not already been written
to by your program or if it has been closed since it was last written to.

   <p><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-printing-561"></a>It is a common error to use <span class="samp">&gt;</span> redirection for the first <code>print</code>
to a file, and then to use <span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span> for subsequent output:

<pre class="example">     # clear the file
     print "Don't panic" &gt; "guide.txt"
     ...
     # append
     print "Avoid improbability generators" &gt;&gt; "guide.txt"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is indeed how redirections must be used from the shell.  But in
<span class="command">awk</span>, it isn't necessary.  In this kind of case, a program should
use <span class="samp">&gt;</span> for all the <code>print</code> statements, since the output file
is only opened once. (It happens that if you mix <span class="samp">&gt;</span> and <span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span>
that output is produced in the expected order. However, mixing the operators
for the same file is definitely poor style, and is confusing to readers
of your program.)

<span class="command">awk</span> implementations limit the number of pipelines that an <span class="command">awk</span>

A particularly powerful way to use redirection is to build command lines
and pipe them into the shell, <span class="command">sh</span>.  For example, suppose you
have a list of files brought over from a system where all the file names
are stored in uppercase, and you wish to rename them to have names in
all lowercase.  The following program is both simple and efficient:

<!-- @cindex @command{mv} utility -->
<pre class="example">     { printf("mv %s %s\n", $0, tolower($0)) | "sh" }
     
     END { close("sh") }
</pre>
   <p>The <code>tolower</code> function returns its argument string with all
uppercase characters converted to lowercase
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>). 
The program builds up a list of command lines,
using the <span class="command">mv</span> utility to rename the files. 
It then sends the list to the shell for execution.

Running programs conventionally have three input and output streams
already available to them for reading and writing.  These are known as
the <dfn>standard input</dfn>, <dfn>standard output</dfn>, and <dfn>standard error
output</dfn>.  These streams are, by default, connected to your terminal, but
they are often redirected with the shell, via the <span class="samp">&lt;</span>, <span class="samp">&lt;&lt;</span>,
<span class="samp">&gt;</span>, <span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span>, <span class="samp">&gt;&amp;</span>, and <span class="samp">|</span> operators.  Standard error
is typically used for writing error messages; the reason there are two separate
streams, standard output and standard error, is so that they can be
redirected separately.

   <p><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-error-messages-576"></a><a name="index-error-handling-577"></a>In other implementations of <span class="command">awk</span>, the only way to write an error
message to standard error in an <span class="command">awk</span> program is as follows:

<pre class="example">     print "Serious error detected!" | "cat 1&gt;&amp;2"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This works by opening a pipeline to a shell command that can access the
standard error stream that it inherits from the <span class="command">awk</span> process. 
This is far from elegant, and it is also inefficient, because it requires a
separate process.  So people writing <span class="command">awk</span> programs often
don't do this.  Instead, they send the error messages to the
terminal, like this:

<pre class="example">     print "Serious error detected!" &gt; "/dev/tty"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This usually has the same effect but not always: although the
standard error stream is usually the terminal, it can be redirected; when
that happens, writing to the terminal is not correct.  In fact, if
<span class="command">awk</span> is run from a background job, it may not have a terminal at all. 
Then opening <span class="file">/dev/tty</span> fails.

   <p><span class="command">gawk</span> provides special file names for accessing the three standard
streams, as well as any other inherited open files.  If the file name matches
one of these special names when <span class="command">gawk</span> redirects input or output,
then it directly uses the stream that the file name stands for. 
These special file names work for all operating systems that <span class="command">gawk</span>

It is a common error to omit the quotes, which leads
to confusing results.

Starting with version 3.1 of <span class="command">gawk</span>, <span class="command">awk</span> programs
can open a two-way
TCP/IP connection, acting as either a client or a server. 
This is done using a special file name of the form:

<p><a name="index-files_002c-output_002c-See-output-files-589"></a><!-- STARTOFRANGE ifc -->

If the same file name or the same shell command is used with <code>getline</code>
more than once during the execution of an <span class="command">awk</span> program
(see <a href="#Getline">Getline</a>),
the file is opened (or the command is executed) the first time only. 
At that time, the first record of input is read from that file or command. 
The next time the same file or command is used with <code>getline</code>,
another record is read from it, and so on.

   <p>Similarly, when a file or pipe is opened for output, the file name or
command associated with it is remembered by <span class="command">awk</span>, and subsequent
writes to the same file or command are appended to the previous writes. 
The file or pipe stays open until <span class="command">awk</span> exits.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bclose_007d-function-595"></a>This implies that special steps are necessary in order to read the same
file again from the beginning, or to rerun a shell command (rather than
reading more output from the same command).  The <code>close</code> function
makes these things possible:

<pre class="example">     close(<var>filename</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or:

<pre class="example">     close(<var>command</var>)
</pre>
   <p>The argument <var>filename</var> or <var>command</var> can be any expression.  Its
value must <em>exactly</em> match the string that was used to open the file or
start the command (spaces and other &ldquo;irrelevant&rdquo; characters
included). For example, if you open a pipe with this:

<pre class="example">     "sort -r names" | getline foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then you must close it with this:

<pre class="example">     close("sort -r names")
</pre>
   <p>Once this function call is executed, the next <code>getline</code> from that
file or command, or the next <code>print</code> or <code>printf</code> to that
file or command, reopens the file or reruns the command. 
Because the expression that you use to close a file or pipeline must
exactly match the expression used to open the file or run the command,
it is good practice to use a variable to store the file name or command. 
The previous example becomes the following:

<pre class="example">     sortcom = "sort -r names"
     sortcom | getline foo
     ...
     close(sortcom)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This helps avoid hard-to-find typographical errors in your <span class="command">awk</span>
programs.  Here are some of the reasons for closing an output file:

     <ul>
<li>To write a file and read it back later on in the same <span class="command">awk</span>
program.  Close the file after writing it, then
begin reading it with <code>getline</code>.

     <li>To write numerous files, successively, in the same <span class="command">awk</span>
program.  If the files aren't closed, eventually <span class="command">awk</span> may exceed a
system limit on the number of open files in one process.  It is best to
close each one when the program has finished writing it.

     <li>To make a command finish.  When output is redirected through a pipe,
the command reading the pipe normally continues to try to read input
as long as the pipe is open.  Often this means the command cannot
really do its work until the pipe is closed.  For example, if
output is redirected to the <span class="command">mail</span> program, the message is not
actually sent until the pipe is closed.

     <li>To run the same program a second time, with the same arguments. 
This is not the same thing as giving more input to the first run!

     <p>For example, suppose a program pipes output to the <span class="command">mail</span> program. 
If it outputs several lines redirected to this pipe without closing
it, they make a single message of several lines.  By contrast, if the
program closes the pipe after each line of output, then each line makes
a separate message. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-_0040code_007bclose_007d-function-596"></a><a name="index-portability_002c-_0040code_007bclose_007d-function-and-597"></a>If you use more files than the system allows you to have open,
<span class="command">gawk</span> attempts to multiplex the available open files among
your data files.  <span class="command">gawk</span>'s ability to do this depends upon the
facilities of your operating system, so it may not always work.  It is
therefore both good practice and good portability advice to always
use <code>close</code> on your files when you are done with them. 
In fact, if you are using a lot of pipes, it is essential that
you close commands when done. For example, consider something like this:

<pre class="example">     {
         ...
         command = ("grep " $1 " /some/file | my_prog -q " $3)
         while ((command | getline) &gt; 0) {
             <var>process output of</var> command
         }
         # need close(command) here
     }
</pre>
   <p>This example creates a new pipeline based on data in <em>each</em> record. 
Without the call to <code>close</code> indicated in the comment, <span class="command">awk</span>
creates child processes to run the commands, until it eventually
runs out of file descriptors for more pipelines.

   <p>Even though each command has finished (as indicated by the end-of-file
return status from <code>getline</code>), the child process is not
terminated;<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-21" name="fnd-21"><sup>21</sup></a>
<!-- Good old UNIX: give the marketing guys fits, that's the ticket -->
more importantly, the file descriptor for the pipe
is not closed and released until <code>close</code> is called or
<span class="command">awk</span> exits.

   <p><code>close</code> will silently do nothing if given an argument that
does not represent a file, pipe or coprocess that was opened with
a redirection.

   <p>Note also that <span class="samp">close(FILENAME)</span> has no
&ldquo;magic&rdquo; effects on the implicit loop that reads through the
files named on the command line.  It is, more likely, a close
of a file that was never opened, so <span class="command">awk</span> silently
does nothing.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_007c_007d-_0028vertical-bar_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_007c_0026_007d-operator-_0028I_002fO_0029_002c-pipes_0040comma_007b_007d-closing-598"></a>When using the <span class="samp">|&amp;</span> operator to communicate with a coprocess,
it is occasionally useful to be able to close one end of the two-way
pipe without closing the other. 
This is done by supplying a second argument to <code>close</code>. 
As in any other call to <code>close</code>,
the first argument is the name of the command or special file used
to start the coprocess. 
The second argument should be a string, with either of the values
<code>"to"</code> or <code>"from"</code>.  Case does not matter.

In many versions of Unix <span class="command">awk</span>, the <code>close</code> function
is actually a statement.  It is a syntax error to try and use the return
value from <code>close</code>:
(d.c.)

<pre class="example">     command = "..."
     command | getline info
     retval = close(command)  # syntax error in most Unix awks
</pre>
   <p><span class="command">gawk</span> treats <code>close</code> as a function. 
The return value is &minus;1 if the argument names something
that was never opened with a redirection, or if there is
a system problem closing the file or process. 
In these cases, <span class="command">gawk</span> sets the built-in variable
<code>ERRNO</code> to a string describing the problem.

   <p>In <span class="command">gawk</span>,
when closing a pipe or coprocess (input or output),
the return value is the exit status of the command.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-22" name="fnd-22"><sup>22</sup></a>
Otherwise, it is the return value from the system's <code>close</code> or
<code>fclose</code> C functions when closing input or output
files, respectively. 
This value is zero if the close succeeds, or &minus;1 if
it fails.

   <p>The POSIX standard is very vague; it says that <code>close</code>
returns zero on success and non-zero otherwise.  In general,
different implementations vary in what they report when closing
pipes; thus the return value cannot be used portably.

Expressions are the basic building blocks of <span class="command">awk</span> patterns
and actions.  An expression evaluates to a value that you can print, test,
or pass to a function.  Additionally, an expression
can assign a new value to a variable or a field by using an assignment operator.

   <p>An expression can serve as a pattern or action statement on its own. 
Most other kinds of
statements contain one or more expressions that specify the data on which to
operate.  As in other languages, expressions in <span class="command">awk</span> include
variables, array references, constants, and function calls, as well as
combinations of these with various operators.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.1 Numeric and String Constants</h4>

<p><a name="index-numeric_002c-constants-607"></a>A <dfn>numeric constant</dfn> stands for a number.  This number can be an
integer, a decimal fraction, or a number in scientific (exponential)
notation.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-23" name="fnd-23"><sup>23</sup></a>
Here are some examples of numeric constants that all
have the same value:

<pre class="example">     105
     1.05e+2
     1050e-1
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-string-constants-608"></a>A string constant consists of a sequence of characters enclosed in
double-quotation marks.  For example:

<pre class="example">     "parrot"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-strings-609"></a><a name="index-strings_002c-length-of-610"></a>represents the string whose contents are <span class="samp">parrot</span>.  Strings in
<span class="command">gawk</span> can be of any length, and they can contain any of the possible
eight-bit ASCII characters including ASCII <span class="sc">nul</span> (character code zero). 
Other <span class="command">awk</span>
implementations may have difficulty with some character codes.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.2 Octal and Hexadecimal Numbers</h4>

<p><a name="index-octal-numbers-611"></a><a name="index-hexadecimal-numbers-612"></a><a name="index-numbers_002c-octal-613"></a><a name="index-numbers_002c-hexadecimal-614"></a>
In <span class="command">awk</span>, all numbers are in decimal; i.e., base 10.  Many other
programming languages allow you to specify numbers in other bases, often
octal (base 8) and hexadecimal (base 16). 
In octal, the numbers go 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, etc. 
Just as <span class="samp">11</span>, in decimal, is 1 times 10 plus 1, so
<span class="samp">11</span>, in octal, is 1 times 8, plus 1. This equals 9 in decimal. 
In hexadecimal, there are 16 digits. Since the everyday decimal
number system only has ten digits (<span class="samp">0</span>&ndash;<span class="samp">9</span>), the letters
<span class="samp">a</span> through <span class="samp">f</span> are used to represent the rest. 
(Case in the letters is usually irrelevant; hexadecimal <span class="samp">a</span> and <span class="samp">A</span>
have the same value.) 
Thus, <span class="samp">11</span>, in
hexadecimal, is 1 times 16 plus 1, which equals 17 in decimal.

   <p>Just by looking at plain <span class="samp">11</span>, you can't tell what base it's in. 
So, in C, C++, and other languages derived from C,
<!-- such as PERL, but we won't mention that.... -->
there is a special notation to help signify the base. 
Octal numbers start with a leading <span class="samp">0</span>,
and hexadecimal numbers start with a leading <span class="samp">0x</span> or <span class="samp">0X</span>:

     <dl>
<dt><code>11</code><dd>Decimal value 11.

     <br><dt><code>011</code><dd>Octal 11, decimal value 9.

     <br><dt><code>0x11</code><dd>Hexadecimal 11, decimal value 17. 
</dl>

   <p>This example shows the difference:

<pre class="example">     $ gawk 'BEGIN { printf "%d, %d, %d\n", 011, 11, 0x11 }'
     -| 9, 11, 17
</pre>
   <p>Being able to use octal and hexadecimal constants in your programs is most
useful when working with data that cannot be represented conveniently as
characters or as regular numbers, such as binary data of various sorts.

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-octal-numbers-and-615"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-hexadecimal-numbers-and-616"></a><span class="command">gawk</span> allows the use of octal and hexadecimal
constants in your program text.  However, such numbers in the input data
are not treated differently; doing so by default would break old
programs. 
(If you really need to do this, use the <span class="option">--non-decimal-data</span>
command-line option;
see <a href="#Nondecimal-Data">Nondecimal Data</a>.) 
If you have octal or hexadecimal data,
you can use the <code>strtonum</code> function
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>)
to convert the data into a number. 
Most of the time, you will want to use octal or hexadecimal constants
when working with the built-in bit manipulation functions;
see <a href="#Bitwise-Functions">Bitwise Functions</a>,
for more information.

   <p>Unlike some early C implementations, <span class="samp">8</span> and <span class="samp">9</span> are not valid
in octal constants; e.g., <span class="command">gawk</span> treats <span class="samp">018</span> as decimal 18:

<pre class="example">     $ gawk 'BEGIN { print "021 is", 021 ; print 018 }'
     -| 021 is 17
     -| 18
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-compatibility-mode-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029_002c-octal-numbers-617"></a><a name="index-compatibility-mode-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029_002c-hexadecimal-numbers-618"></a>Octal and hexadecimal source code constants are a <span class="command">gawk</span> extension. 
If <span class="command">gawk</span> is in compatibility mode
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>),
they are not available.

<p><a name="index-advanced-features_002c-constants_0040comma_007b_007d-values-of-619"></a>
Once a numeric constant has
been converted internally into a number,
<span class="command">gawk</span> no longer remembers
what the original form of the constant was; the internal value is
always used.  This has particular consequences for conversion of
numbers to strings:

<h3 class="section">5.2 Using Regular Expression Constants</h3>

<p><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-regexp-constants-625"></a>When used on the righthand side of the <span class="samp">~</span> or <span class="samp">!~</span>
operators, a regexp constant merely stands for the regexp that is to be
matched. 
However, regexp constants (such as <code>/foo/</code>) may be used like simple expressions. 
When a
regexp constant appears by itself, it has the same meaning as if it appeared
in a pattern, i.e., <span class="samp">($0 ~ /foo/)</span>
(d.c.) 
See <a href="#Expression-Patterns">Expression Patterns</a>. 
This means that the following two code segments:

<pre class="example">     if ($0 ~ /barfly/ || $0 ~ /camelot/)
         print "found"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and:

<pre class="example">     if (/barfly/ || /camelot/)
         print "found"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">are exactly equivalent. 
One rather bizarre consequence of this rule is that the following
Boolean expression is valid, but does not do what the user probably
intended:

<pre class="example">     # note that /foo/ is on the left of the ~
     if (/foo/ ~ $1) print "found foo"
</pre>
   <!-- @cindex automatic warnings -->
<!-- @cindex warnings, automatic -->
<p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-regexp-constants-and-626"></a><a name="index-regexp-constants_002c-in-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-627"></a>This code is &ldquo;obviously&rdquo; testing <code>$1</code> for a match against the regexp
<code>/foo/</code>.  But in fact, the expression <span class="samp">/foo/ ~ $1</span> actually means
<span class="samp">($0 ~ /foo/) ~ $1</span>.  In other words, first match the input record
against the regexp <code>/foo/</code>.  The result is either zero or one,
depending upon the success or failure of the match.  That result
is then matched against the first field in the record. 
Because it is unlikely that you would ever really want to make this kind of
test, <span class="command">gawk</span> issues a warning when it sees this construct in
a program. 
Another consequence of this rule is that the assignment statement:

<pre class="example">     matches = /foo/
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">assigns either zero or one to the variable <code>matches</code>, depending
upon the contents of the current input record. 
This feature of the language has never been well documented until the
POSIX specification.

   <p><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-regexp-constants-628"></a><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-regexp-constants_002c-as-arguments-to-user_002ddefined-functions-629"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bgensub_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029-630"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bsub_007d-function-631"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bgsub_007d-function-632"></a>Constant regular expressions are also used as the first argument for
the <code>gensub</code>, <code>sub</code>, and <code>gsub</code> functions, and as the
second argument of the <code>match</code> function
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>). 
Modern implementations of <span class="command">awk</span>, including <span class="command">gawk</span>, allow
the third argument of <code>split</code> to be a regexp constant, but some
older implementations do not. 
(d.c.) 
This can lead to confusion when attempting to use regexp constants
as arguments to user-defined functions
(see <a href="#User_002ddefined">User-defined</a>). 
For example:

<pre class="example">     function mysub(pat, repl, str, global)
     {
         if (global)
             gsub(pat, repl, str)
         else
             sub(pat, repl, str)
         return str
     }
     
     {
         ...
         text = "hi! hi yourself!"
         mysub(/hi/, "howdy", text, 1)
         ...
     }
</pre>
   <!-- @cindex automatic warnings -->
<!-- @cindex warnings, automatic -->
<p>In this example, the programmer wants to pass a regexp constant to the
user-defined function <code>mysub</code>, which in turn passes it on to
either <code>sub</code> or <code>gsub</code>.  However, what really happens is that
the <code>pat</code> parameter is either one or zero, depending upon whether
or not <code>$0</code> matches <code>/hi/</code>. 
<span class="command">gawk</span> issues a warning when it sees a regexp constant used as
a parameter to a user-defined function, since passing a truth value in
this way is probably not what was intended.

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.1 Using Variables in a Program</h4>

<p>Variables let you give names to values and refer to them later.  Variables
have already been used in many of the examples.  The name of a variable
must be a sequence of letters, digits, or underscores, and it may not begin
with a digit.  Case is significant in variable names; <code>a</code> and <code>A</code>
are distinct variables.

   <p>A variable name is a valid expression by itself; it represents the
variable's current value.  Variables are given new values with
<dfn>assignment operators</dfn>, <dfn>increment operators</dfn>, and
<dfn>decrement operators</dfn>. 
See <a href="#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Ops</a>. 
<!-- NEXT ED: Can also be changed by sub, gsub, split -->

   <p><a name="index-variables_002c-built_002din-635"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-initializing-636"></a>A few variables have special built-in meanings, such as <code>FS</code> (the
field separator), and <code>NF</code> (the number of fields in the current input
record).  See <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>, for a list of the built-in variables. 
These built-in variables can be used and assigned just like all other
variables, but their values are also used or changed automatically by
<span class="command">awk</span>.  All built-in variables' names are entirely uppercase.

   <p>Variables in <span class="command">awk</span> can be assigned either numeric or string values. 
The kind of value a variable holds can change over the life of a program. 
By default, variables are initialized to the empty string, which
is zero if converted to a number.  There is no need to
&ldquo;initialize&rdquo; each variable explicitly in <span class="command">awk</span>,
which is what you would do in C and in most other traditional languages.

Any <span class="command">awk</span> variable can be set by including a <dfn>variable assignment</dfn>
among the arguments on the command line when <span class="command">awk</span> is invoked
(see <a href="#Other-Arguments">Other Arguments</a>). 
Such an assignment has the following form:

<pre class="example">     <var>variable</var>=<var>text</var>
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002dv_007d-option_002c-variables_0040comma_007b_007d-assigning-639"></a>With it, a variable is set either at the beginning of the
<span class="command">awk</span> run or in between input files. 
When the assignment is preceded with the <span class="option">-v</span> option,
as in the following:

<pre class="example">     -v <var>variable</var>=<var>text</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the variable is set at the very beginning, even before the
<code>BEGIN</code> rules are run.  The <span class="option">-v</span> option and its assignment
must precede all the file name arguments, as well as the program text. 
(See <a href="#Options">Options</a>, for more information about
the <span class="option">-v</span> option.) 
Otherwise, the variable assignment is performed at a time determined by
its position among the input file arguments&mdash;after the processing of the
preceding input file argument.  For example:

<pre class="example">     awk '{ print $n }' n=4 inventory-shipped n=2 BBS-list
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">prints the value of field number <code>n</code> for all input records.  Before
the first file is read, the command line sets the variable <code>n</code>
equal to four.  This causes the fourth field to be printed in lines from
the file <span class="file">inventory-shipped</span>.  After the first file has finished,
but before the second file is started, <code>n</code> is set to two, so that the
second field is printed in lines from <span class="file">BBS-list</span>:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ print $n }' n=4 inventory-shipped n=2 BBS-list
     -| 15
     -| 24

of the <span class="command">awk</span> program demands it.  For example, if the value of
either <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code> in the expression <span class="samp">foo + bar</span>
happens to be a string, it is converted to a number before the addition
is performed.  If numeric values appear in string concatenation, they
are converted to strings.  Consider the following:

<pre class="example">     two = 2; three = 3
     print (two three) + 4
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This prints the (numeric) value 27.  The numeric values of
the variables <code>two</code> and <code>three</code> are converted to strings and
concatenated together.  The resulting string is converted back to the
number 23, to which 4 is then added.

   <p><a name="index-null-strings_002c-converting-numbers-to-strings-645"></a><a name="index-type-conversion-646"></a>If, for some reason, you need to force a number to be converted to a
string, concatenate the empty string, <code>""</code>, with that number. 
To force a string to be converted to a number, add zero to that string. 
A string is converted to a number by interpreting any numeric prefix
of the string as numerals:
<code>"2.5"</code> converts to 2.5, <code>"1e3"</code> converts to 1000, and <code>"25fix"</code>
has a numeric value of 25. 
Strings that can't be interpreted as valid numbers convert to zero.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bCONVFMT_007d-variable-647"></a>The exact manner in which numbers are converted into strings is controlled
by the <span class="command">awk</span> built-in variable <code>CONVFMT</code> (see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>). 
Numbers are converted using the <code>sprintf</code> function
with <code>CONVFMT</code> as the format
specifier
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>).

   <p><code>CONVFMT</code>'s default value is <code>"%.6g"</code>, which prints a value with
at least six significant digits.  For some applications, you might want to
change it to specify more precision. 
On most modern machines,
17 digits is enough to capture a floating-point number's
value exactly,
most of the time.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-24" name="fnd-24"><sup>24</sup></a>

   <p><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-_0040code_007bCONVFMT_007d-variable-648"></a>Strange results can occur if you set <code>CONVFMT</code> to a string that doesn't
tell <code>sprintf</code> how to format floating-point numbers in a useful way. 
For example, if you forget the <span class="samp">%</span> in the format, <span class="command">awk</span> converts
all numbers to the same constant string. 
As a special case, if a number is an integer, then the result of converting
it to a string is <em>always</em> an integer, no matter what the value of
<code>CONVFMT</code> may be.  Given the following code fragment:

<pre class="example">     CONVFMT = "%2.2f"
     a = 12
     b = a ""
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>b</code> has the value <code>"12"</code>, not <code>"12.00"</code>.

of <code>OFMT</code> for converting numbers to strings.  <code>OFMT</code>
specifies the output format to use when printing numbers with <code>print</code>. 
<code>CONVFMT</code> was introduced in order to separate the semantics of
conversion from the semantics of printing.  Both <code>CONVFMT</code> and
<code>OFMT</code> have the same default value: <code>"%.6g"</code>.  In the vast majority
of cases, old <span class="command">awk</span> programs do not change their behavior. 
However, these semantics for <code>OFMT</code> are something to keep in mind if you must
port your new style program to older implementations of <span class="command">awk</span>. 
We recommend
that instead of changing your programs, just port <span class="command">gawk</span> itself. 
See <a href="#Print">Print</a>,
for more information on the <code>print</code> statement.

   <p>And, once again, where you are can matter when it comes to converting
between numbers and strings.  In <a href="#Locales">Locales</a>, we mentioned that
the local character set and language (the locale) can affect how
<span class="command">gawk</span> matches characters.  The locale also affects numeric
formats.  In particular, for <span class="command">awk</span> programs, it affects the
decimal point character.  The <code>"C"</code> locale, and most English-language
locales, use the period character (<span class="samp">.</span>) as the decimal point. 
However, many (if not most) European and non-English locales use the comma
(<span class="samp">,</span>) as the decimal point character.

   <p>The POSIX standard says that <span class="command">awk</span> always uses the period as the decimal
point when reading the <span class="command">awk</span> program source code, and for command-line
variable assignments (see <a href="#Other-Arguments">Other Arguments</a>). 
However, when interpreting input data, for <code>print</code> and <code>printf</code> output,
and for number to string conversion, the local decimal point character is used. 
Here are some examples indicating the difference in behavior,
on a GNU/Linux system:

<pre class="example">     $ gawk 'BEGIN { printf "%g\n", 3.1415927 }'
     -| 3.14159
     $  LC_ALL=en_DK gawk 'BEGIN { printf "%g\n", 3.1415927 }'
     -| 3,14159
     $ echo 4,321 | gawk '{ print $1 + 1 }'
     -| 5
     $ echo 4,321 | LC_ALL=en_DK gawk '{ print $1 + 1 }'
     -| 5,321
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <span class="samp">en_DK</span> locale is for English in Denmark, where the comma acts as
the decimal point separator.  In the normal <code>"C"</code> locale, <span class="command">gawk</span>
treats <span class="samp">4,321</span> as <span class="samp">4</span>, while in the Danish locale, it's treated
as the full number, <span class="samp">4.321</span>.

   <p>For version 3.1.3 through 3.1.5, <span class="command">gawk</span> fully complied
with this aspect of the standard.  However, many users in non-English
locales complained about this behavior, since their data used a period
as the decimal point.  Beginning in version 3.1.6, the default
behavior was restored to use a period as the decimal point character. 
You can use the <span class="option">--use-lc-numeric</span> option (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>)
to force <span class="command">gawk</span> to use the locale's decimal point character. 
(<span class="command">gawk</span> also uses the locale's decimal point character when in
POSIX mode, either via <span class="option">--posix</span>, or the <span class="env">POSIXLY_CORRECT</span>
environment variable.)

   <p>The following table describes the cases in which the locale's decimal
point character is used and when a period is used. Some of these
features have not been described yet.

<span class="command">gawk</span> converts some special string values to numbers.  The details

   <p>The <span class="command">awk</span> language uses the common arithmetic operators when
evaluating expressions.  All of these arithmetic operators follow normal
precedence rules and work as you would expect them to.

   <p>The following example uses a file named <span class="file">grades</span>, which contains
a list of student names as well as three test scores per student (it's
a small class):

<pre class="example">     Pat   100 97 58
     Sandy  84 72 93
     Chris  72 92 89
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This programs takes the file <span class="file">grades</span> and prints the average
of the scores:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ sum = $2 + $3 + $4 ; avg = sum / 3

     -| Pat 85
     -| Sandy 83
     -| Chris 84.3333
</pre>
   <p>The following list provides the arithmetic operators in <span class="command">awk</span>, in order from
the highest precedence to the lowest:

     <dl>
<dt><code>- </code><var>x</var><dd>Negation.

the value 0.75.  (It is a common mistake, especially for C programmers,

   <p>Unary plus and minus have the same precedence,

   <p>One possibly undesirable effect of this definition of remainder is that

<h3 class="section">5.6 String Concatenation</h3>

<p><a name="index-Kernighan_002c-Brian-663"></a><blockquote>
<i>It seemed like a good idea at the time.</i><br>

</blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-string-operators-664"></a><a name="index-operators_002c-string-665"></a><a name="index-concatenating-666"></a>There is only one string operation: concatenation.  It does not have a
specific operator to represent it.  Instead, concatenation is performed by
writing expressions next to one another, with no operator.  For example:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ print "Field number one: " $1 }' BBS-list
     -| Field number one: aardvark
     -| Field number one: alpo-net
     ...
</pre>
   <p>Without the space in the string constant after the <span class="samp">:</span>, the line
runs together.  For example:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ print "Field number one:" $1 }' BBS-list
     -| Field number one:aardvark
     -| Field number one:alpo-net
     ...
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-string-concatenation-667"></a>Because string concatenation does not have an explicit operator, it is
often necessary to insure that it happens at the right time by using
parentheses to enclose the items to concatenate.  For example,
you might expect that the
following code fragment concatenates <code>file</code> and <code>name</code>:

<pre class="example">     file = "file"
     name = "name"
     print "something meaningful" &gt; file name
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This produces a syntax error with Unix <span class="command">awk</span>.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-25" name="fnd-25"><sup>25</sup></a>
It is necessary to use the following:

<pre class="example">     print "something meaningful" &gt; (file name)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-order-of-evaluation_002c-concatenation-668"></a><a name="index-evaluation-order_002c-concatenation-669"></a><a name="index-side-effects-670"></a>Parentheses should be used around concatenation in all but the
most common contexts, such as on the righthand side of <span class="samp">=</span>. 
Be careful about the kinds of expressions used in string concatenation. 
In particular, the order of evaluation of expressions used for concatenation
is undefined in the <span class="command">awk</span> language.  Consider this example:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN {
         a = "don't"
         print (a " " (a = "panic"))
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It is not defined whether the assignment to <code>a</code> happens
before or after the value of <code>a</code> is retrieved for producing the
concatenated value.  The result could be either <span class="samp">don't panic</span>,
or <span class="samp">panic panic</span>. 
<!-- see test/nasty.awk for a worse example -->
The precedence of concatenation, when mixed with other operators, is often
counter-intuitive.  Consider this example:

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN { print -12 " " -24 }'
     -| -12-24
</pre>
   <p>This &ldquo;obviously&rdquo; is concatenating &minus;12, a space, and &minus;24. 
But where did the space disappear to? 
The answer lies in the combination of operator precedences and
<span class="command">awk</span>'s automatic conversion rules.  To get the desired result,
write the program in the following manner:

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN { print -12 " " (-24) }'
     -| -12 -24
</pre>
   <p>This forces <span class="command">awk</span> to treat the <span class="samp">-</span> on the <span class="samp">-24</span> as unary. 
Otherwise, it's parsed as follows:

<pre class="display">         &minus;12 (<code>" "</code> &minus; 24)
     =&gt; &minus;12 (0 &minus; 24)
     =&gt; &minus;12 (&minus;24)
     =&gt; &minus;12&minus;24
</pre>
   <p>As mentioned earlier,
when doing concatenation, <em>parenthesize</em>.  Otherwise,
you're never quite sure what you'll get.

value into a variable.  For example, let's assign the value one to the variable
<code>z</code>:

<pre class="example">     z = 1
</pre>
   <p>After this expression is executed, the variable <code>z</code> has the value one. 
Whatever old value <code>z</code> had before the assignment is forgotten.

   <p>Assignments can also store string values.  For example, the
following stores
the value <code>"this food is good"</code> in the variable <code>message</code>:

<pre class="example">     thing = "food"
     predicate = "good"
     message = "this " thing " is " predicate
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-side-effects_002c-assignment-expressions-676"></a>This also illustrates string concatenation. 
The <span class="samp">=</span> sign is called an <dfn>assignment operator</dfn>.  It is the
simplest assignment operator because the value of the righthand
operand is stored unchanged. 
Most operators (addition, concatenation, and so on) have no effect
except to compute a value.  If the value isn't used, there's no reason to
use the operator.  An assignment operator is different; it does
produce a value, but even if you ignore it, the assignment still
makes itself felt through the alteration of the variable.  We call this
a <dfn>side effect</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-lvalues_002frvalues-677"></a><a name="index-rvalues_002flvalues-678"></a><a name="index-assignment-operators_002c-lvalues_002frvalues-679"></a><a name="index-operators_002c-assignment-680"></a>The lefthand operand of an assignment need not be a variable
(see <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>); it can also be a field
(see <a href="#Changing-Fields">Changing Fields</a>) or
an array element (see <a href="#Arrays">Arrays</a>). 
These are all called <dfn>lvalues</dfn>,
which means they can appear on the lefthand side of an assignment operator. 
The righthand operand may be any expression; it produces the new value
that the assignment stores in the specified variable, field, or array
element. (Such values are called <dfn>rvalues</dfn>.)

   <p><a name="index-variables_002c-types-of-681"></a>It is important to note that variables do <em>not</em> have permanent types. 
A variable's type is simply the type of whatever value it happens
to hold at the moment.  In the following program fragment, the variable
<code>foo</code> has a numeric value at first, and a string value later on:

<pre class="example">     foo = 1
     print foo
     foo = "bar"
     print foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When the second assignment gives <code>foo</code> a string value, the fact that
it previously had a numeric value is forgotten.

   <p>String values that do not begin with a digit have a numeric value of
zero. After executing the following code, the value of <code>foo</code> is five:

<pre class="example">     foo = "a string"
     foo = foo + 5
</pre>
   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> Using a variable as a number and then later as a string
can be confusing and is poor programming style.  The previous two examples
illustrate how <span class="command">awk</span> works, <em>not</em> how you should write your
programs! 
</blockquote>

   <p>An assignment is an expression, so it has a value&mdash;the same value that
is assigned.  Thus, <span class="samp">z = 1</span> is an expression with the value one. 
One consequence of this is that you can write multiple assignments together,
such as:

<pre class="example">     x = y = z = 5
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This example stores the value five in all three variables
(<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>). 
It does so because the
value of <span class="samp">z = 5</span>, which is five, is stored into <code>y</code> and then
the value of <span class="samp">y = z = 5</span>, which is five, is stored into <code>x</code>.

   <p>Assignments may be used anywhere an expression is called for.  For
example, it is valid to write <span class="samp">x != (y = 1)</span> to set <code>y</code> to one,
and then test whether <code>x</code> equals one.  But this style tends to make
programs hard to read; such nesting of assignments should be avoided,
except perhaps in a one-shot program.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002b_007d-_0028plus-sign_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_002b_003d_007d-operator-682"></a><a name="index-plus-sign-_0028_0040code_007b_002b_007d_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_002b_003d_007d-operator-683"></a>Aside from <span class="samp">=</span>, there are several other assignment operators that
do arithmetic with the old value of the variable.  For example, the
operator <span class="samp">+=</span> computes a new value by adding the righthand value
to the old value of the variable.  Thus, the following assignment adds
five to the value of <code>foo</code>:

<pre class="example">     foo += 5
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is equivalent to the following:

<pre class="example">     foo = foo + 5
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Use whichever makes the meaning of your program clearer.

   <p>There are situations where using <span class="samp">+=</span> (or any assignment operator)
is <em>not</em> the same as simply repeating the lefthand operand in the
righthand expression.  For example:

   <p><a name="index-Rankin_002c-Pat-684"></a>
<pre class="example">     # Thanks to Pat Rankin for this example
     BEGIN  {
         foo[rand()] += 5
         for (x in foo)
            print x, foo[x]
     
         bar[rand()] = bar[rand()] + 5
         for (x in bar)
            print x, bar[x]
     }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-operators_002c-assignment_002c-evaluation-order-685"></a><a name="index-assignment-operators_002c-evaluation-order-686"></a>The indices of <code>bar</code> are practically guaranteed to be different, because
<code>rand</code> returns different values each time it is called. 
(Arrays and the <code>rand</code> function haven't been covered yet. 
See <a href="#Arrays">Arrays</a>,
and see <a href="#Numeric-Functions">Numeric Functions</a>, for more information). 
This example illustrates an important fact about assignment
operators: the lefthand expression is only evaluated <em>once</em>. 
It is up to the implementation as to which expression is evaluated
first, the lefthand or the righthand. 
Consider this example:

<pre class="example">     i = 1
     a[i += 2] = i + 1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The value of <code>a[3]</code> could be either two or four.

   <p><a href="#table_002dassign_002dops">table-assign-ops</a> lists the arithmetic assignment operators.  In each
case, the righthand operand is an expression whose value is converted

<a name="index-operators_002c-decrement_002fincrement-713"></a><dfn>Increment</dfn> and <dfn>decrement operators</dfn> increase or decrease the value of
a variable by one.  An assignment operator can do the same thing, so
the increment operators add no power to the <span class="command">awk</span> language; however, they
are convenient abbreviations for very common operations.

   <p><a name="index-side-effects-714"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002b_007d-_0028plus-sign_0029_002c-decrement_002fincrement-operators-715"></a><a name="index-plus-sign-_0028_0040code_007b_002b_007d_0029_002c-decrement_002fincrement-operators-716"></a><a name="index-side-effects_002c-decrement_002fincrement-operators-717"></a>The operator used for adding one is written <span class="samp">++</span>.  It can be used to increment
a variable either before or after taking its value. 
To pre-increment a variable <code>v</code>, write <span class="samp">++v</span>.  This adds
one to the value of <code>v</code>&mdash;that new value is also the value of the
expression. (The assignment expression <span class="samp">v += 1</span> is completely
equivalent.) 
Writing the <span class="samp">++</span> after the variable specifies post-increment.  This
increments the variable value just the same; the difference is that the
value of the increment expression itself is the variable's <em>old</em>
value.  Thus, if <code>foo</code> has the value four, then the expression <span class="samp">foo++</span>
has the value four, but it changes the value of <code>foo</code> to five. 
In other words, the operator returns the old value of the variable,
but with the side effect of incrementing it.

   <p>The post-increment <span class="samp">foo++</span> is nearly the same as writing <span class="samp">(foo
+= 1) - 1</span>.  It is not perfectly equivalent because all numbers in
<span class="command">awk</span> are floating-point&mdash;in floating-point, <span class="samp">foo + 1 - 1</span> does
not necessarily equal <code>foo</code>.  But the difference is minute as
long as you stick to numbers that are fairly small (less than 10e12).

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0024_007d-_0028dollar-sign_0029_002c-incrementing-fields-and-arrays-718"></a><a name="index-dollar-sign-_0028_0040code_007b_0024_007d_0029_002c-incrementing-fields-and-arrays-719"></a>Fields and array elements are incremented
just like variables.  (Use <span class="samp">$(i++)</span> when you want to do a field reference
and a variable increment at the same time.  The parentheses are necessary
because of the precedence of the field reference operator <span class="samp">$</span>.)

   <p><a name="index-decrement-operators-720"></a>The decrement operator <span class="samp">--</span> works just like <span class="samp">++</span>, except that
it subtracts one instead of adding it.  As with <span class="samp">++</span>, it can be used before
the lvalue to pre-decrement or after it to post-decrement. 
Following is a summary of increment and decrement expressions:

<a name="index-null-strings-736"></a>Many programming languages have a special representation for the concepts
of &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;false.&rdquo;  Such languages usually use the special
constants <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, or perhaps their uppercase
equivalents. 
However, <span class="command">awk</span> is different. 
It borrows a very simple concept of true and
false from C.  In <span class="command">awk</span>, any nonzero numeric value <em>or</em> any
nonempty string value is true.  Any other value (zero or the null
string <code>""</code>) is false.  The following program prints <span class="samp">A strange
truth value</span> three times:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN {
        if (3.1415927)
            print "A strange truth value"
        if ("Four Score And Seven Years Ago")
            print "A strange truth value"
        if (j = 57)
            print "A strange truth value"
     }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-dark-corner-737"></a>There is a surprising consequence of the &ldquo;nonzero or non-null&rdquo; rule:
the string constant <code>"0"</code> is actually true, because it is non-null.

<h4 class="subsection">5.10.1 String Type Versus Numeric Type</h4>

<p><a name="index-numeric_002c-strings-746"></a><a name="index-strings_002c-numeric-747"></a><a name="index-POSIX-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-numeric-strings-and-748"></a>The 1992 POSIX standard introduced
the concept of a <dfn>numeric string</dfn>, which is simply a string that looks
like a number&mdash;for example, <code>"&nbsp;+2"<!-- /@w --></code>.  This concept is used
for determining the type of a variable. 
The type of the variable is important because the types of two variables
determine how they are compared. 
In <span class="command">gawk</span>, variable typing follows these rules:

     <ul>
<li>A numeric constant or the result of a numeric operation has the <var>numeric</var>
attribute.

     <li>A string constant or the result of a string operation has the <var>string</var>
attribute.

     <li>Fields, <code>getline</code> input, <code>FILENAME</code>, <code>ARGV</code> elements,
<code>ENVIRON</code> elements, and the
elements of an array created by <code>split</code> that are numeric strings
have the <var>strnum</var> attribute.  Otherwise, they have the <var>string</var>
attribute. 
Uninitialized variables also have the <var>strnum</var> attribute.

     <li>Attributes propagate across assignments but are not changed by
any use. 
<!-- (Although a use may cause the entity to acquire an additional -->
<!-- value such that it has both a numeric and string value, this leaves the -->
<!-- attribute unchanged.) -->
<!-- This is important but not relevant -->
</ul>

   <p>The last rule is particularly important. In the following program,
<code>a</code> has numeric type, even though it is later used in a string
operation:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN {
          a = 12.345
          b = a " is a cute number"
          print b
     }
</pre>
   <p>When two operands are compared, either string comparison or numeric comparison
may be used. This depends upon the attributes of the operands, according to the
following symmetric matrix:

<!-- thanks to Karl Berry, kb@cs.umb.edu, for major help with TeX tables -->
<pre class="display">             +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;
             |       STRING          NUMERIC         STRNUM
     &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;+&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;
             |
     STRING  |       string          string          string
             |
     NUMERIC |       string          numeric         numeric
             |
     STRNUM  |       string          numeric         numeric
     &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;+&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;
</pre>
   <p>The basic idea is that user input that looks numeric&mdash;and <em>only</em>
user input&mdash;should be treated as numeric, even though it is actually
made of characters and is therefore also a string. 
Thus, for example, the string constant <code>"&nbsp;+3.14"</code><!-- /@w -->,
when it appears in program source code,
is a string&mdash;even though it looks numeric&mdash;and
is <em>never</em> treated as number for comparison
purposes.

   <p>In short, when one operand is a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; string, such as a string
constant, then a string comparison is performed.  Otherwise, a
numeric comparison is performed.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-26" name="fnd-26"><sup>26</sup></a>

   <p>This point bears additional emphasis: All user input is made of characters,
and so is first and foremost of <var>string</var> type; input strings
that look numeric are additionally given the <var>strnum</var> attribute. 
Thus, the six-character input string <span class="samp">&nbsp;+3.14</span><!-- /@w --> receives the
<var>strnum</var> attribute. In contrast, the eight-character literal
<code>"&nbsp;+3.14"</code><!-- /@w --> appearing in program text is a string constant. 
The following examples print <span class="samp">1</span> when the comparison between
the two different constants is true, <span class="samp">0</span> otherwise:

   <p>Comparison expressions have the value one if true and zero if false. 
When comparing operands of mixed types, numeric operands are converted
to strings using the value of <code>CONVFMT</code>
(see <a href="#Conversion">Conversion</a>).

   <p>Strings are compared
by comparing the first character of each, then the second character of each,
and so on.  Thus, <code>"10"</code> is less than <code>"9"</code>.  If there are two
strings where one is a prefix of the other, the shorter string is less than
the longer one.  Thus, <code>"abc"</code> is less than <code>"abcd"</code>.

   <p><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-_0040code_007b_003d_003d_007d-operator-766"></a>It is very easy to accidentally mistype the <span class="samp">==</span> operator and
leave off one of the <span class="samp">=</span> characters.  The result is still valid <span class="command">awk</span>
code, but the program does not do what is intended:

<pre class="example">     if (a = b)   # oops! should be a == b
        ...
     else
        ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Unless <code>b</code> happens to be zero or the null string, the <code>if</code>
part of the test always succeeds.  Because the operators are
so similar, this kind of error is very difficult to spot when
scanning the source code.

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-comparison-operators-and-767"></a>The following table of expressions illustrates the kind of comparison
<span class="command">gawk</span> performs, as well as what the result of the comparison is:

     <dl>
<dt><code>1.5 &lt;= 2.0</code><dd>numeric comparison (true)

     <br><dt><code>"abc" &gt;= "xyz"</code><dd>string comparison (false)

     <br><dt><code>1.5 != " +2"</code><dd>string comparison (true)

     <br><dt><code>"1e2" &lt; "3"</code><dd>string comparison (true)

     <br><dt><code>a = 2; b = "2"</code><dt><code>a == b</code><dd>string comparison (true)

     <br><dt><code>a = 2; b = " +2"</code><br><dt><code>a == b</code><dd>string comparison (false)
</dl>

   <p>In the next example:

<pre class="example">     $ echo 1e2 3 | awk '{ print ($1 &lt; $2) ? "true" : "false" }'
     -| false
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-comparison-expressions_002c-string-vs_002e_0040_003a-regexp-768"></a><!-- @cindex string comparison vs.@: regexp comparison -->
<!-- @cindex regexp comparison vs.@: string comparison -->
the result is <span class="samp">false</span> because both <code>$1</code> and <code>$2</code>
are user input.  They are numeric strings&mdash;therefore both have
the <var>strnum</var> attribute, dictating a numeric comparison. 
The purpose of the comparison rules and the use of numeric strings is
to attempt to produce the behavior that is &ldquo;least surprising,&rdquo; while
still &ldquo;doing the right thing.&rdquo;
String comparisons and regular expression comparisons are very different. 
For example:

<pre class="example">     x == "foo"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">has the value one, or is true if the variable <code>x</code>
is precisely <span class="samp">foo</span>.  By contrast:

<pre class="example">     x ~ /foo/
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">has the value one if <code>x</code> contains <span class="samp">foo</span>, such as
<code>"Oh, what a fool am I!"</code>.

either a regexp constant (<code>/.../</code>) or an ordinary
expression. In the latter case, the value of the expression as a string is used as a
dynamic regexp (see <a href="#Regexp-Usage">Regexp Usage</a>; also
see <a href="#Computed-Regexps">Computed Regexps</a>).

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-regexp-constants-and-773"></a><a name="index-regexp-constants-774"></a>In modern implementations of <span class="command">awk</span>, a constant regular
expression in slashes by itself is also an expression.  The regexp
<code>/</code><var>regexp</var><code>/</code> is an abbreviation for the following comparison expression:

<pre class="example">     $0 ~ /<var>regexp</var>/
</pre>
   <p>One special place where <code>/foo/</code> is <em>not</em> an abbreviation for
<span class="samp">$0 ~ /foo/</span> is when it is the righthand operand of <span class="samp">~</span> or
<span class="samp">!~</span>.

A <dfn>Boolean expression</dfn> is a combination of comparison expressions or
matching expressions, using the Boolean operators &ldquo;or&rdquo;
(<span class="samp">||</span>), &ldquo;and&rdquo; (<span class="samp">&amp;&amp;</span>), and &ldquo;not&rdquo; (<span class="samp">!</span>), along with
parentheses to control nesting.  The truth value of the Boolean expression is
computed by combining the truth values of the component expressions. 
Boolean expressions are also referred to as <dfn>logical expressions</dfn>. 
The terms are equivalent.

   <p>Boolean expressions can be used wherever comparison and matching
expressions can be used.  They can be used in <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>,
<code>do</code>, and <code>for</code> statements
(see <a href="#Statements">Statements</a>). 
They have numeric values (one if true, zero if false) that come into play
if the result of the Boolean expression is stored in a variable or
used in arithmetic.

   <p>In addition, every Boolean expression is also a valid pattern, so
you can use one as a pattern to control the execution of rules. 
The Boolean operators are:

     <dl>
<dt><var>boolean1</var><code> &amp;&amp; </code><var>boolean2</var><dd>True if both <var>boolean1</var> and <var>boolean2</var> are true.  For example,
the following statement prints the current input record if it contains
both <span class="samp">2400</span> and <span class="samp">foo</span>:

     <pre class="example">          if ($0 ~ /2400/ &amp;&amp; $0 ~ /foo/) print
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-side-effects_002c-Boolean-operators-784"></a>The subexpression <var>boolean2</var> is evaluated only if <var>boolean1</var>
is true.  This can make a difference when <var>boolean2</var> contains
expressions that have side effects. In the case of <span class="samp">$0 ~ /foo/ &amp;&amp;
($2 == bar++)</span>, the variable <code>bar</code> is not incremented if there is
no substring <span class="samp">foo</span> in the record.

     <br><dt><var>boolean1</var><code> || </code><var>boolean2</var><dd>True if at least one of <var>boolean1</var> or <var>boolean2</var> is true. 
For example, the following statement prints all records in the input
that contain <em>either</em> <span class="samp">2400</span> or
<span class="samp">foo</span> or both:

     <pre class="example">          if ($0 ~ /2400/ || $0 ~ /foo/) print
     </pre>
     <p>The subexpression <var>boolean2</var> is evaluated only if <var>boolean1</var>
is false.  This can make a difference when <var>boolean2</var> contains
expressions that have side effects.

     <br><dt><code>! </code><var>boolean</var><dd>True if <var>boolean</var> is false.  For example,
the following program prints <span class="samp">no home!</span> in
the unusual event that the <span class="env">HOME</span> environment
variable is not defined:

     <pre class="example">          BEGIN { if (! ("HOME" in ENVIRON))
                         print "no home!" }
     </pre>

<a href="#Reference-to-Elements">Reference to Elements</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-line-continuations-791"></a>Statements that use <span class="samp">&amp;&amp;</span> or <span class="samp">||</span> can be continued simply

either one or zero, depending upon the truth value of the expression it

The <span class="samp">!</span> operator is often useful for changing the sense of a flag
variable from false to true and back again. For example, the following
program is one way to print lines in between special bracketing lines:

<pre class="example">     $1 == "START"   { interested = ! interested; next }
     interested == 1 { print }
     $1 == "END"     { interested = ! interested; next }

   <p class="noindent">The variable <code>interested</code>, as with all <span class="command">awk</span> variables, starts
out initialized to zero, which is also false.  When a line is seen whose
first field is <span class="samp">START</span>, the value of <code>interested</code> is toggled
to true, using <span class="samp">!</span>. The next rule prints lines as long as
<code>interested</code> is true.  When a line is seen whose first field is
<span class="samp">END</span>, <code>interested</code> is toggled back to false.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-27" name="fnd-27"><sup>27</sup></a>

<h3 class="section">5.12 Conditional Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-conditional-expressions-798"></a><a name="index-expressions_002c-conditional-799"></a><a name="index-expressions_002c-selecting-800"></a>
A <dfn>conditional expression</dfn> is a special kind of expression that has
three operands.  It allows you to use one expression's value to select
one of two other expressions. 
The conditional expression is the same as in the C language,
as shown here:

<pre class="example">     <var>selector</var> ? <var>if-true-exp</var> : <var>if-false-exp</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">There are three subexpressions.  The first, <var>selector</var>, is always
computed first.  If it is &ldquo;true&rdquo; (not zero or not null), then
<var>if-true-exp</var> is computed next and its value becomes the value of
the whole expression.  Otherwise, <var>if-false-exp</var> is computed next
and its value becomes the value of the whole expression. 
For example, the following expression produces the absolute value of <code>x</code>:

<pre class="example">     x &gt;= 0 ? x : -x
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-side-effects_002c-conditional-expressions-801"></a>Each time the conditional expression is computed, only one of
<var>if-true-exp</var> and <var>if-false-exp</var> is used; the other is ignored. 
This is important when the expressions have side effects.  For example,
this conditional expression examines element <code>i</code> of either array
<code>a</code> or array <code>b</code>, and increments <code>i</code>:

<pre class="example">     x == y ? a[i++] : b[i++]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is guaranteed to increment <code>i</code> exactly once, because each time
only one of the two increment expressions is executed
and the other is not. 
See <a href="#Arrays">Arrays</a>,
for more information about arrays.

   <p><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-line-continuations-802"></a><a name="index-line-continuations_002c-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-803"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-line-continuation-in-804"></a>As a minor <span class="command">gawk</span> extension,
a statement that uses <span class="samp">?:</span> can be continued simply
by putting a newline after either character. 
However, putting a newline in front
of either character does not work without using backslash continuation
(see <a href="#Statements_002fLines">Statements/Lines</a>). 
If <span class="option">--posix</span> is specified
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>), then this extension is disabled.

<h3 class="section">5.13 Function Calls</h3>

<p><a name="index-function-calls-805"></a>
A <dfn>function</dfn> is a name for a particular calculation. 
This enables you to
ask for it by name at any point in the program.  For
example, the function <code>sqrt</code> computes the square root of a number.

   <p><a name="index-functions_002c-built_002din-806"></a>A fixed set of functions are <dfn>built-in</dfn>, which means they are
available in every <span class="command">awk</span> program.  The <code>sqrt</code> function is one
of these.  See <a href="#Built_002din">Built-in</a>, for a list of built-in
functions and their descriptions.  In addition, you can define
functions for use in your program. 
See <a href="#User_002ddefined">User-defined</a>,
for instructions on how to do this.

   <p><a name="index-arguments_002c-in-function-calls-807"></a>The way to use a function is with a <dfn>function call</dfn> expression,
which consists of the function name followed immediately by a list of
<dfn>arguments</dfn> in parentheses.  The arguments are expressions that
provide the raw materials for the function's calculations. 
When there is more than one argument, they are separated by commas.  If
there are no arguments, just write <span class="samp">()</span> after the function name. 
The following examples show function calls with and without arguments:

<pre class="example">     sqrt(x^2 + y^2)        <i>one argument</i>
     atan2(y, x)            <i>two arguments</i>
     rand()                 <i>no arguments</i>
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-function-call-syntax-808"></a><strong>Caution:</strong>
Do not put any space between the function name and the open-parenthesis! 
A user-defined function name looks just like the name of a
variable&mdash;a space would make the expression look like concatenation of
a variable with an expression inside parentheses.

   <p>With built-in functions, space before the parenthesis is harmless, but
it is best not to get into the habit of using space to avoid mistakes
with user-defined functions.  Each function expects a particular number
of arguments.  For example, the <code>sqrt</code> function must be called with
a single argument, the number of which to take the square root:

<pre class="example">     sqrt(<var>argument</var>)
</pre>
   <p>Some of the built-in functions have one or
more optional arguments. 
If those arguments are not supplied, the functions
use a reasonable default value. 
See <a href="#Built_002din">Built-in</a>, for full details.  If arguments
are omitted in calls to user-defined functions, then those arguments are
treated as local variables and initialized to the empty string
(see <a href="#User_002ddefined">User-defined</a>).

   <p><a name="index-side-effects_002c-function-calls-809"></a>Like every other expression, the function call has a value, which is
computed by the function based on the arguments you give it.  In this
example, the value of <span class="samp">sqrt(</span><var>argument</var><span class="samp">)</span> is the square root of
<var>argument</var>. 
The following program reads numbers, one number per line, and prints the
square root of each one:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ print "The square root of", $1, "is", sqrt($1) }'
     1
     -| The square root of 1 is 1
     3
     -| The square root of 3 is 1.73205
     5
     -| The square root of 5 is 2.23607
     <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>A function can also have side effects, such as assigning
values to certain variables or doing I/O. 
This program shows how the <span class="samp">match</span> function
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>)
changes the variables <code>RSTART</code> and <code>RLENGTH</code>:

<pre class="example">     {
         if (match($1, $2))
             print RSTART, RLENGTH
         else
             print "no match"
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here is a sample run:

<pre class="example">     $ awk -f matchit.awk
     aaccdd  c+
     -| 3 2
     foo     bar
     -| no match
     abcdefg e
     -| 5 1

<h3 class="section">5.14 Operator Precedence (How Operators Nest)</h3>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE prec -->
<p><a name="index-precedence-810"></a><!-- STARTOFRANGE oppr -->
<a name="index-operators_002c-precedence-811"></a>
<dfn>Operator precedence</dfn> determines how operators are grouped when
different operators appear close by in one expression.  For example,
<span class="samp">*</span> has higher precedence than <span class="samp">+</span>; thus, <span class="samp">a + b * c</span>
means to multiply <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, and then add <code>a</code> to the
product (i.e., <span class="samp">a + (b * c)</span>).

   <p>The normal precedence of the operators can be overruled by using parentheses. 
Think of the precedence rules as saying where the
parentheses are assumed to be.  In
fact, it is wise to always use parentheses whenever there is an unusual
combination of operators, because other people who read the program may
not remember what the precedence is in this case. 
Even experienced programmers occasionally forget the exact rules,
which leads to mistakes. 
Explicit parentheses help prevent
any such mistakes.

   <p>When operators of equal precedence are used together, the leftmost
operator groups first, except for the assignment, conditional, and
exponentiation operators, which group in the opposite order. 
Thus, <span class="samp">a - b + c</span> groups as <span class="samp">(a - b) + c</span> and
<span class="samp">a = b = c</span> groups as <span class="samp">a = (b = c)</span>.

   <p>Normally the precedence of prefix unary operators does not matter,
because there is only one way to interpret
them: innermost first.  Thus, <span class="samp">$++i</span> means <span class="samp">$(++i)</span> and
<span class="samp">++$x</span> means <span class="samp">++($x)</span>.  However, when another operator follows
the operand, then the precedence of the unary operators can matter. 
<span class="samp">$x^2</span> means <span class="samp">($x)^2</span>, but <span class="samp">-x^2</span> means
<span class="samp">-(x^2)</span>, because <span class="samp">-</span> has lower precedence than <span class="samp">^</span>,
whereas <span class="samp">$</span> has higher precedence. 
Also, operators cannot be combined in a way that violates the
precedence rules; for example, <span class="samp">$$0++--</span> is not a valid
expression because the first <span class="samp">$</span> has higher precedence than the
<span class="samp">++</span>; to avoid the problem the expression can be rewritten as
<span class="samp">$($0++)--</span>.

As you have already seen, each <span class="command">awk</span> statement consists of
a pattern with an associated action.  This chapter describes how
you build patterns and actions, what kinds of things you can do within
actions, and <span class="command">awk</span>'s built-in variables.

   <p>The pattern-action rules and the statements available for use
within actions form the core of <span class="command">awk</span> programming. 
In a sense, everything covered
up to here has been the foundation
that programs are built on top of.  Now it's time to start
building something useful.

The following is a summary of the types of <span class="command">awk</span> patterns:

     <dl>
<dt><code>/</code><var>regular expression</var><code>/</code><dd>A regular expression. It matches when the text of the

<p><a name="index-patterns_002c-expressions-as-889"></a><a name="index-regular-expressions_002c-as-patterns-890"></a>
Regular expressions are one of the first kinds of patterns presented
in this book. 
This kind of pattern is simply a regexp constant in the pattern part of
a rule.  Its  meaning is <span class="samp">$0 ~ /</span><var>pattern</var><span class="samp">/</span>. 
The pattern matches when the input record matches the regexp. 
For example:

<pre class="example">     /foo|bar|baz/  { buzzwords++ }
     END            { print buzzwords, "buzzwords seen" }
</pre>

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.2 Expressions as Patterns</h4>

<p><a name="index-expressions_002c-as-patterns-891"></a>
Any <span class="command">awk</span> expression is valid as an <span class="command">awk</span> pattern. 
The pattern matches if the expression's value is nonzero (if a
number) or non-null (if a string). 
The expression is reevaluated each time the rule is tested against a new
input record.  If the expression uses fields such as <code>$1</code>, the
value depends directly on the new input record's text; otherwise, it
depends on only what has happened so far in the execution of the
<span class="command">awk</span> program.

   <p><a name="index-comparison-expressions_002c-as-patterns-892"></a><a name="index-patterns_002c-comparison-expressions-as-893"></a>Comparison expressions, using the comparison operators described in
<a href="#Typing-and-Comparison">Typing and Comparison</a>,
are a very common kind of pattern. 
Regexp matching and nonmatching are also very common expressions. 
The left operand of the <span class="samp">~</span> and <span class="samp">!~</span> operators is a string. 
The right operand is either a constant regular expression enclosed in
slashes (<code>/</code><var>regexp</var><code>/</code>), or any expression whose string value
is used as a dynamic regular expression
(see <a href="#Computed-Regexps">Computed Regexps</a>). 
The following example prints the second field of each input record
whose first field is precisely <span class="samp">foo</span>:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002f_007d-_0028forward-slash_0029_002c-patterns-and-894"></a><a name="index-forward-slash-_0028_0040code_007b_002f_007d_0029_002c-patterns-and-895"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_007e_007d-_0028tilde_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_007e_007d-operator-896"></a><a name="index-tilde-_0028_0040code_007b_007e_007d_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_007e_007d-operator-897"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0021_007d-_0028exclamation-point_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_0021_007e_007d-operator-898"></a><a name="index-exclamation-point-_0028_0040code_007b_0021_007d_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_0021_007e_007d-operator-899"></a>
<pre class="example">     $ awk '$1 == "foo" { print $2 }' BBS-list
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(There is no output, because there is no BBS site with the exact name <span class="samp">foo</span>.) 
Contrast this with the following regular expression match, which
accepts any record with a first field that contains <span class="samp">foo</span>:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '$1 ~ /foo/ { print $2 }' BBS-list
     -| 555-1234
     -| 555-6699
     -| 555-6480
     -| 555-2127
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-regexp-constants_002c-as-patterns-900"></a><a name="index-patterns_002c-regexp-constants-as-901"></a>A regexp constant as a pattern is also a special case of an expression
pattern.  The expression <code>/foo/</code> has the value one if <span class="samp">foo</span>
appears in the current input record. Thus, as a pattern, <code>/foo/</code>
matches any record containing <span class="samp">foo</span>.

   <p><a name="index-Boolean-expressions_002c-as-patterns-902"></a>Boolean expressions are also commonly used as patterns. 
Whether the pattern
matches an input record depends on whether its subexpressions match. 
For example, the following command prints all the records in
<span class="file">BBS-list</span> that contain both <span class="samp">2400</span> and <span class="samp">foo</span>:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '/2400/ &amp;&amp; /foo/' BBS-list
     -| fooey        555-1234     2400/1200/300     B
</pre>
   <p>The following command prints all records in
<span class="file">BBS-list</span> that contain <em>either</em> <span class="samp">2400</span> or <span class="samp">foo</span>
(or both, of course):

<pre class="example">     $ awk '/2400/ || /foo/' BBS-list
     -| alpo-net     555-3412     2400/1200/300     A
     -| bites        555-1675     2400/1200/300     A
     -| fooey        555-1234     2400/1200/300     B
     -| foot         555-6699     1200/300          B
     -| macfoo       555-6480     1200/300          A
     -| sdace        555-3430     2400/1200/300     A
     -| sabafoo      555-2127     1200/300          C
</pre>
   <p>The following command prints all records in
<span class="file">BBS-list</span> that do <em>not</em> contain the string <span class="samp">foo</span>:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '! /foo/' BBS-list
     -| aardvark     555-5553     1200/300          B
     -| alpo-net     555-3412     2400/1200/300     A
     -| barfly       555-7685     1200/300          A

expressions, comparisons, or any other <span class="command">awk</span> expressions.  Range
patterns are not expressions, so they cannot appear inside Boolean
patterns.  Likewise, the special patterns <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code>,
which never match any input record, are not expressions and cannot
appear inside Boolean patterns.

the form <var>begpat</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>endpat</var>.  It is used to match ranges of
consecutive input records.  The first pattern, <var>begpat</var>, controls
where the range begins, while <var>endpat</var> controls where
the pattern ends.  For example, the following:

<pre class="example">     awk '$1 == "on", $1 == "off"' myfile
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">prints every record in <span class="file">myfile</span> between <span class="samp">on</span>/<span class="samp">off</span> pairs, inclusive.

   <p>A range pattern starts out by matching <var>begpat</var> against every
input record.  When a record matches <var>begpat</var>, the range pattern is
<dfn>turned on</dfn> and the range pattern matches this record as well.  As long as
the range pattern stays turned on, it automatically matches every input
record read.  The range pattern also matches <var>endpat</var> against every
input record; when this succeeds, the range pattern is turned off again
for the following record.  Then the range pattern goes back to checking
<var>begpat</var> against each record.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bif_007d-statement_002c-actions_0040comma_007b_007d-changing-910"></a>The record that turns on the range pattern and the one that turns it
off both match the range pattern.  If you don't want to operate on
these records, you can write <code>if</code> statements in the rule's action
to distinguish them from the records you are interested in.

   <p>It is possible for a pattern to be turned on and off by the same
record. If the record satisfies both conditions, then the action is
executed for just that record. 
For example, suppose there is text between two identical markers (e.g.,
the <span class="samp">%</span> symbol), each on its own line, that should be ignored. 
A first attempt would be to
combine a range pattern that describes the delimited text with the
<code>next</code> statement
(not discussed yet, see <a href="#Next-Statement">Next Statement</a>). 
This causes <span class="command">awk</span> to skip any further processing of the current
record and start over again with the next input record. Such a program
looks like this:

<pre class="example">     /^%$/,/^%$/    { next }
                    { print }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-lines_002c-skipping-between-markers-911"></a><!-- @cindex flag variables -->
This program fails because the range pattern is both turned on and turned off
by the first line, which just has a <span class="samp">%</span> on it.  To accomplish this task,
write the program in the following manner, using a flag:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0021_007d-operator-912"></a>
<pre class="example">     /^%$/     { skip = ! skip; next }
     skip == 1 { next } # skip lines with `skip' set
</pre>
   <p>In a range pattern, the comma (<span class="samp">,</span>) has the lowest precedence of
all the operators (i.e., it is evaluated last).  Thus, the following
program attempts to combine a range pattern with another, simpler test:

<pre class="example">     echo Yes | awk '/1/,/2/ || /Yes/'
</pre>
   <p>The intent of this program is <span class="samp">(/1/,/2/) || /Yes/</span>. 
However, <span class="command">awk</span> interprets this as <span class="samp">/1/, (/2/ || /Yes/)</span>. 
This cannot be changed or worked around; range patterns do not combine
with other patterns:

<pre class="example">     $ echo Yes | gawk '(/1/,/2/) || /Yes/'
     error--&gt; gawk: cmd. line:1: (/1/,/2/) || /Yes/
     error--&gt; gawk: cmd. line:1:           ^ parse error
     error--&gt; gawk: cmd. line:2: (/1/,/2/) || /Yes/
     error--&gt; gawk: cmd. line:2:                   ^ unexpected newline

The <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> special patterns are different. 
They supply startup and cleanup actions for <span class="command">awk</span> programs. 
<code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules must have actions; there is no default
action for these rules because there is no current record when they run. 
<code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules are often referred to as

that contain the string <span class="samp">foo</span>.  The <code>BEGIN</code> rule prints a title
for the report.  There is no need to use the <code>BEGIN</code> rule to
initialize the counter <code>n</code> to zero, since <span class="command">awk</span> does this
automatically (see <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>). 
The second rule increments the variable <code>n</code> every time a
record containing the pattern <span class="samp">foo</span> is read.  The <code>END</code> rule
prints the value of <code>n</code> at the end of the run.

   <p>The special patterns <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> cannot be used in ranges
or with Boolean operators (indeed, they cannot be used with any operators). 
An <span class="command">awk</span> program may have multiple <code>BEGIN</code> and/or <code>END</code>
rules.  They are executed in the order in which they appear: all the <code>BEGIN</code>
rules at startup and all the <code>END</code> rules at termination. 
<code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules may be intermixed with other rules. 
This feature was added in the 1987 version of <span class="command">awk</span> and is included
in the POSIX standard. 
The original (1978) version of <span class="command">awk</span>
required the <code>BEGIN</code> rule to be placed at the beginning of the
program, the <code>END</code> rule to be placed at the end, and only allowed one of
each. 
This is no longer required, but it is a good idea to follow this template
in terms of program organization and readability.

   <p>Multiple <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules are useful for writing
library functions, because each library file can have its own <code>BEGIN</code> and/or
<code>END</code> rule to do its own initialization and/or cleanup. 
The order in which library functions are named on the command line
controls the order in which their <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules are
executed.  Therefore, you have to be careful when writing such rules in
library files so that the order in which they are executed doesn't matter. 
See <a href="#Options">Options</a>, for more information on
using library functions. 
See <a href="#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>,
for a number of useful library functions.

   <p>If an <span class="command">awk</span> program has only a <code>BEGIN</code> rule and no
other rules, then the program exits after the <code>BEGIN</code> rule is
run.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-28" name="fnd-28"><sup>28</sup></a>  However, if an
<code>END</code> rule exists, then the input is read, even if there are
no other rules in the program.  This is necessary in case the <code>END</code>
rule checks the <code>FNR</code> and <code>NR</code> variables.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.1.4.2 Input/Output from <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> Rules</h5>

<p><a name="index-input_002foutput_002c-from-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-and-_0040code_007bEND_007d-917"></a>There are several (sometimes subtle) points to remember when doing I/O
from a <code>BEGIN</code> or <code>END</code> rule. 
The first has to do with the value of <code>$0</code> in a <code>BEGIN</code>
rule.  Because <code>BEGIN</code> rules are executed before any input is read,
there simply is no input record, and therefore no fields, when
executing <code>BEGIN</code> rules.  References to <code>$0</code> and the fields
yield a null string or zero, depending upon the context.  One way
to give <code>$0</code> a real value is to execute a <code>getline</code> command
without a variable (see <a href="#Getline">Getline</a>). 
Another way is simply to assign a value to <code>$0</code>.

   <p><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d_002f_0040code_007bEND_007d-patterns-918"></a><a name="index-POSIX-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d_002f_0040code_007bEND_007d-patterns-919"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bprint_007d-statement_002c-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d_002f_0040code_007bEND_007d-patterns-and-920"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern_002c-_0040code_007bprint_007d-statement-and-921"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bEND_007d-pattern_002c-_0040code_007bprint_007d-statement-and-922"></a>The second point is similar to the first but from the other direction. 
Traditionally, due largely to implementation issues, <code>$0</code> and
<code>NF</code> were <em>undefined</em> inside an <code>END</code> rule. 
The POSIX standard specifies that <code>NF</code> is available in an <code>END</code>
rule. It contains the number of fields from the last input record. 
Most probably due to an oversight, the standard does not say that <code>$0</code>
is also preserved, although logically one would think that it should be. 
In fact, <span class="command">gawk</span> does preserve the value of <code>$0</code> for use in
<code>END</code> rules.  Be aware, however, that Unix <span class="command">awk</span>, and possibly
other implementations, do not.

   <p>The third point follows from the first two.  The meaning of <span class="samp">print</span>
inside a <code>BEGIN</code> or <code>END</code> rule is the same as always:
<span class="samp">print $0</span>.  If <code>$0</code> is the null string, then this prints an
empty line.  Many long time <span class="command">awk</span> programmers use an unadorned
<span class="samp">print</span> in <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules, to mean <span class="samp">print&nbsp;""<!-- /@w --></span>,
relying on <code>$0</code> being null.  Although one might generally get away with
this in <code>BEGIN</code> rules, it is a very bad idea in <code>END</code> rules,
at least in <span class="command">gawk</span>.  It is also poor style, since if an empty
line is needed in the output, the program should print one explicitly.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bnext_007d-statement_002c-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d_002f_0040code_007bEND_007d-patterns-and-923"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bnextfile_007d-statement_002c-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d_002f_0040code_007bEND_007d-patterns-and-924"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern_002c-_0040code_007bnext_007d_002f_0040code_007bnextfile_007d-statements-and-925"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bEND_007d-pattern_002c-_0040code_007bnext_007d_002f_0040code_007bnextfile_007d-statements-and-926"></a>Finally, the <code>next</code> and <code>nextfile</code> statements are not allowed
in a <code>BEGIN</code> rule, because the implicit
read-a-record-and-match-against-the-rules loop has not started yet.  Similarly, those statements
are not valid in an <code>END</code> rule, since all the input has been read.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Using Shell Variables in Programs</h3>

<p><a name="index-shells_002c-variables-929"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-shell-variables-in-930"></a><!-- @cindex shell and @command{awk} interaction -->

   <p><span class="command">awk</span> programs are often used as components in larger
programs written in shell. 
For example, it is very common to use a shell variable to
hold a pattern that the <span class="command">awk</span> program searches for. 
There are two ways to get the value of the shell variable
into the body of the <span class="command">awk</span> program.

   <p><a name="index-shells_002c-quoting-931"></a>The most common method is to use shell quoting to substitute
the variable's value into the program inside the script. 
For example, in the following program:

<pre class="example">     echo -n "Enter search pattern: "
     read pattern
     awk "/$pattern/ "'{ nmatches++ }
          END { print nmatches, "found" }' /path/to/data
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the <span class="command">awk</span> program consists of two pieces of quoted text
that are concatenated together to form the program. 
The first part is double-quoted, which allows substitution of
the <code>pattern</code> variable inside the quotes. 
The second part is single-quoted.

   <p>Variable substitution via quoting works, but can be potentially
messy.  It requires a good understanding of the shell's quoting rules
(see <a href="#Quoting">Quoting</a>),
and it's often difficult to correctly
match up the quotes when reading the program.

   <p>A better method is to use <span class="command">awk</span>'s variable assignment feature
(see <a href="#Assignment-Options">Assignment Options</a>)
to assign the shell variable's value to an <span class="command">awk</span> variable's
value.  Then use dynamic regexps to match the pattern
(see <a href="#Computed-Regexps">Computed Regexps</a>). 
The following shows how to redo the
previous example using this technique:

<pre class="example">     echo -n "Enter search pattern: "
     read pattern
     awk -v pat="$pattern" '$0 ~ pat { nmatches++ }
            END { print nmatches, "found" }' /path/to/data
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now, the <span class="command">awk</span> program is just one single-quoted string. 
The assignment <span class="samp">-v pat="$pattern"</span> still requires double quotes,
in case there is whitespace in the value of <code>$pattern</code>. 
The <span class="command">awk</span> variable <code>pat</code> could be named <code>pattern</code>
too, but that would be more confusing.  Using a variable also
provides more flexibility, since the variable can be used anywhere inside
the program&mdash;for printing, as an array subscript, or for any other
use&mdash;without requiring the quoting tricks at every point in the program.

<p><a name="index-actions-932"></a>
An <span class="command">awk</span> program or script consists of a series of
rules and function definitions interspersed.  (Functions are
described later.  See <a href="#User_002ddefined">User-defined</a>.) 
A rule contains a pattern and an action, either of which (but not
both) may be omitted.  The purpose of the <dfn>action</dfn> is to tell
<span class="command">awk</span> what to do once a match for the pattern is found.  Thus,
in outline, an <span class="command">awk</span> program generally looks like this:

<pre class="example">     <span class="roman">[</span><var>pattern</var><span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">[</span>{ <var>action</var> }<span class="roman">]</span>

in curly braces (<span class="samp">{...}</span>).  Each statement specifies one
thing to do.  The statements are separated by newlines or semicolons. 
The curly braces around an action must be used even if the action
contains only one statement, or if it contains no statements at
all.  However, if you omit the action entirely, omit the curly braces as
well.  An omitted action is equivalent to <span class="samp">{ print $0 }</span>:

<pre class="example">     /foo/  { }     <i>match </i><code>foo</code><i>, do nothing --- empty action</i>
     /foo/          <i>match </i><code>foo</code><i>, print the record --- omitted action</i>

<a name="index-side-effects_002c-statements-939"></a>
<dl><dt>Expressions<dd>Call functions or assign values to variables
(see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>).  Executing
this kind of statement simply computes the value of the expression.

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bif_007d-statement-951"></a>The <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> statement is <span class="command">awk</span>'s decision-making
statement.  It looks like this:

<pre class="example">     if (<var>condition</var>) <var>then-body</var> <span class="roman">[</span>else <var>else-body</var><span class="roman">]</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <var>condition</var> is an expression that controls what the rest of the
statement does.  If the <var>condition</var> is true, <var>then-body</var> is
executed; otherwise, <var>else-body</var> is executed. 
The <code>else</code> part of the statement is
optional.  The condition is considered false if its value is zero or
the null string; otherwise, the condition is true. 
Refer to the following:

<pre class="example">     if (x % 2 == 0)
         print "x is even"
     else
         print "x is odd"
</pre>
   <p>In this example, if the expression <span class="samp">x % 2 == 0</span> is true (that is,
if the value of <code>x</code> is evenly divisible by two), then the first
<code>print</code> statement is executed; otherwise, the second <code>print</code>
statement is executed. 
If the <code>else</code> keyword appears on the same line as <var>then-body</var> and
<var>then-body</var> is not a compound statement (i.e., not surrounded by
curly braces), then a semicolon must separate <var>then-body</var> from
the <code>else</code>. 
To illustrate this, the previous example can be rewritten as:

<pre class="example">     if (x % 2 == 0) print "x is even"; else
             print "x is odd"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the <span class="samp">;</span> is left out, <span class="command">awk</span> can't interpret the statement and
it produces a syntax error.  Don't actually write programs this way,
because a human reader might fail to see the <code>else</code> if it is not
the first thing on its line.

<h4 class="subsection">6.4.2 The <code>while</code> Statement</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bwhile_007d-statement-952"></a><a name="index-loops-953"></a><a name="index-loops_002c-See-Also-_0040code_007bwhile_007d-statement-954"></a>
In programming, a <dfn>loop</dfn> is a part of a program that can
be executed two or more times in succession. 
The <code>while</code> statement is the simplest looping statement in
<span class="command">awk</span>.  It repeatedly executes a statement as long as a condition is
true.  For example:

<pre class="example">     while (<var>condition</var>)
       <var>body</var>
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-body_002c-in-loops-955"></a><var>body</var> is a statement called the <dfn>body</dfn> of the loop,
and <var>condition</var> is an expression that controls how long the loop
keeps running. 
The first thing the <code>while</code> statement does is test the <var>condition</var>. 
If the <var>condition</var> is true, it executes the statement <var>body</var>. 
After <var>body</var> has been executed,
<var>condition</var> is tested again, and if it is still true, <var>body</var> is
executed again.  This process repeats until the <var>condition</var> is no longer
true.  If the <var>condition</var> is initially false, the body of the loop is
never executed and <span class="command">awk</span> continues with the statement following
the loop. 
This example prints the first three fields of each record, one per line:

<pre class="example">     awk '{ i = 1
            while (i &lt;= 3) {
                print $i
                i++
            }

   <p class="noindent">The body of this loop is a compound statement enclosed in braces,
containing two statements. 
The loop works in the following manner: first, the value of <code>i</code> is set to one. 
Then, the <code>while</code> statement tests whether <code>i</code> is less than or equal to
three.  This is true when <code>i</code> equals one, so the <code>i</code>-th
field is printed.  Then the <span class="samp">i++</span> increments the value of <code>i</code>
and the loop repeats.  The loop terminates when <code>i</code> reaches four.

   <p>A newline is not required between the condition and the
body; however using one makes the program clearer unless the body is a
compound statement or else is very simple.  The newline after the open-brace
that begins the compound statement is not required either, but the
program is harder to read without it.

<h4 class="subsection">6.4.3 The <code>do</code>-<code>while</code> Statement</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bdo_007d_002d_0040code_007bwhile_007d-statement-956"></a>
The <code>do</code> loop is a variation of the <code>while</code> looping statement. 
The <code>do</code> loop executes the <var>body</var> once and then repeats the
<var>body</var> as long as the <var>condition</var> is true.  It looks like this:

<pre class="example">     do
       <var>body</var>
     while (<var>condition</var>)
</pre>
   <p>Even if the <var>condition</var> is false at the start, the <var>body</var> is
executed at least once (and only once, unless executing <var>body</var>
makes <var>condition</var> true).  Contrast this with the corresponding
<code>while</code> statement:

<pre class="example">     while (<var>condition</var>)
       <var>body</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This statement does not execute <var>body</var> even once if the <var>condition</var>
is false to begin with. 
The following is an example of a <code>do</code> statement:

<pre class="example">     {      i = 1
            do {
               print $0
               i++
            } while (i &lt;= 10)
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This program prints each input record 10 times.  However, it isn't a very
realistic example, since in this case an ordinary <code>while</code> would do
just as well.  This situation reflects actual experience; only
occasionally is there a real use for a <code>do</code> statement.

<h4 class="subsection">6.4.4 The <code>for</code> Statement</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bfor_007d-statement-957"></a>
The <code>for</code> statement makes it more convenient to count iterations of a
loop.  The general form of the <code>for</code> statement looks like this:

<pre class="example">     for (<var>initialization</var>; <var>condition</var>; <var>increment</var>)
       <var>body</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <var>initialization</var>, <var>condition</var>, and <var>increment</var> parts are
arbitrary <span class="command">awk</span> expressions, and <var>body</var> stands for any
<span class="command">awk</span> statement.

   <p>The <code>for</code> statement starts by executing <var>initialization</var>. 
Then, as long
as the <var>condition</var> is true, it repeatedly executes <var>body</var> and then
<var>increment</var>.  Typically, <var>initialization</var> sets a variable to
either zero or one, <var>increment</var> adds one to it, and <var>condition</var>
compares it against the desired number of iterations. 
For example:

<pre class="example">     awk '{ for (i = 1; i &lt;= 3; i++)
               print $i
     }' inventory-shipped
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This prints the first three fields of each input record, with one field per
line.

   <p>It isn't possible to
set more than one variable in the
<var>initialization</var> part without using a multiple assignment statement
such as <span class="samp">x = y = 0</span>. This makes sense only if all the initial values
are equal.  (But it is possible to initialize additional variables by writing
their assignments as separate statements preceding the <code>for</code> loop.)

<!-- @cindex comma operator, not supported -->
<p>The same is true of the <var>increment</var> part. Incrementing additional
variables requires separate statements at the end of the loop. 
The C compound expression, using C's comma operator, is useful in
this context but it is not supported in <span class="command">awk</span>.

   <p>Most often, <var>increment</var> is an increment expression, as in the previous
example.  But this is not required; it can be any expression
whatsoever.  For example, the following statement prints all the powers of two
between 1 and 100:

<pre class="example">     for (i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i *= 2)
       print i
</pre>
   <p>If there is nothing to be done, any of the three expressions in the
parentheses following the <code>for</code> keyword may be omitted.  Thus,
<span class="samp">for&nbsp;(;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0;)</span><!-- /@w --> is equivalent to <span class="samp">while&nbsp;(x&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0)</span><!-- /@w -->.  If the
<var>condition</var> is omitted, it is treated as true, effectively
yielding an <dfn>infinite loop</dfn> (i.e., a loop that never terminates).

   <p>In most cases, a <code>for</code> loop is an abbreviation for a <code>while</code>
loop, as shown here:

<pre class="example">     <var>initialization</var>
     while (<var>condition</var>) {
       <var>body</var>
       <var>increment</var>
     }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-loops_002c-_0040code_007bcontinue_007d-statements-and-958"></a>The only exception is when the <code>continue</code> statement
(see <a href="#Continue-Statement">Continue Statement</a>) is used
inside the loop. Changing a <code>for</code> statement to a <code>while</code>
statement in this way can change the effect of the <code>continue</code>
statement inside the loop.

   <p>The <span class="command">awk</span> language has a <code>for</code> statement in addition to a
<code>while</code> statement because a <code>for</code> loop is often both less work to
type and more natural to think of.  Counting the number of iterations is
very common in loops.  It can be easier to think of this counting as part
of looping rather than as something to do inside the loop.

   <p>The <code>switch</code> statement allows the evaluation of an expression and
the execution of statements based on a <code>case</code> match. Case statements
are checked for a match in the order they are defined.  If no suitable
<code>case</code> is found, the <code>default</code> section is executed, if supplied.

   <p>Each <code>case</code> contains a single constant, be it numeric, string, or
regexp.  The <code>switch</code> expression is evaluated, and then each
<code>case</code>'s constant is compared against the result in turn. The type of constant
determines the comparison: numeric or string do the usual comparisons. 
A regexp constant does a regular expression match against the string
value of the original expression.  The general form of the <code>switch</code>
statement looks like this:

<pre class="example">     switch (<var>expression</var>) {
     case <var>value or regular expression</var>:
         <var>case-body</var>
     default:
         <var>default-body</var>
     }
</pre>
   <p>Control flow in
the <code>switch</code> statement works as it does in C. Once a match to a given
case is made, case statement bodies are executed until a <code>break</code>,
<code>continue</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>nextfile</code>  or <code>exit</code> is encountered,
or the end of the <code>switch</code> statement itself. For example:

<pre class="example">     switch (NR * 2 + 1) {
     case 3:
     case "11":
         print NR - 1
         break
     
     case /2[[:digit:]]+/:
         print NR
     
     default:
         print NR + 1
     
     case -1:
         print NR * -1
     }
</pre>
   <p>Note that if none of the statements specified above halt execution
of a matched <code>case</code> statement, execution falls through to the
next <code>case</code> until execution halts. In the above example, for
any case value starting with <span class="samp">2</span> followed by one or more digits,
the <code>print</code> statement is executed and then falls through into the
<code>default</code> section, executing its <code>print</code> statement. In turn,
the &minus;1 case will also be executed since the <code>default</code> does
not halt execution.

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bbreak_007d-statement-962"></a><a name="index-loops_002c-exiting-963"></a>
The <code>break</code> statement jumps out of the innermost <code>for</code>,
<code>while</code>, or <code>do</code> loop that encloses it.  The following example
finds the smallest divisor of any integer, and also identifies prime
numbers:

<pre class="example">     # find smallest divisor of num
     {
        num = $1
        for (div = 2; div*div &lt;= num; div++)
          if (num % div == 0)
            break
        if (num % div == 0)
          printf "Smallest divisor of %d is %d\n", num, div
        else
          printf "%d is prime\n", num
     }
</pre>
   <p>When the remainder is zero in the first <code>if</code> statement, <span class="command">awk</span>
immediately <dfn>breaks out</dfn> of the containing <code>for</code> loop.  This means
that <span class="command">awk</span> proceeds immediately to the statement following the loop
and continues processing.  (This is very different from the <code>exit</code>
statement, which stops the entire <span class="command">awk</span> program. 
See <a href="#Exit-Statement">Exit Statement</a>.)

   <p>Th following program illustrates how the <var>condition</var> of a <code>for</code>
or <code>while</code> statement could be replaced with a <code>break</code> inside
an <code>if</code>:

<pre class="example">     # find smallest divisor of num
     {
       num = $1
       for (div = 2; ; div++) {
         if (num % div == 0) {
           printf "Smallest divisor of %d is %d\n", num, div
           break
         }
         if (div*div &gt; num) {
           printf "%d is prime\n", num
           break
         }
       }

(see <a href="#Next-Statement">Next Statement</a>).

<span class="command">gawk</span> supports this use of <code>break</code> only
if <span class="option">--traditional</span>

(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>). 
Otherwise, it is treated as an error, since the POSIX standard
specifies that <code>break</code> should only be used inside the body of a

<h4 class="subsection">6.4.7 The <code>continue</code> Statement</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bcontinue_007d-statement-967"></a>As with <code>break</code>, the <code>continue</code> statement is used only inside
<code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do</code> loops.  It skips
over the rest of the loop body, causing the next cycle around the loop
to begin immediately.  Contrast this with <code>break</code>, which jumps out
of the loop altogether.

   <p>The <code>continue</code> statement in a <code>for</code> loop directs <span class="command">awk</span> to
skip the rest of the body of the loop and resume execution with the
increment-expression of the <code>for</code> statement.  The following program
illustrates this fact:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN {

              if (x == 5)

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This program prints all the numbers from 0 to 20&mdash;except for 5, for
which the <code>printf</code> is skipped.  Because the increment <span class="samp">x++</span>

<code>for</code> loop from the previous example with the following <code>while</code> loop:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN {
          x = 0
          while (x &lt;= 20) {

<h4 class="subsection">6.4.8 The <code>next</code> Statement</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bnext_007d-statement-971"></a>
The <code>next</code> statement forces <span class="command">awk</span> to immediately stop processing
the current record and go on to the next record.  This means that no
further rules are executed for the current record, and the rest of the
current rule's action isn't executed.

   <p>Contrast this with the effect of the <code>getline</code> function
(see <a href="#Getline">Getline</a>).  That also causes
<span class="command">awk</span> to read the next record immediately, but it does not alter the
flow of control in any way (i.e., the rest of the current action executes
with a new input record).

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-execution-of-972"></a>At the highest level, <span class="command">awk</span> program execution is a loop that reads
an input record and then tests each rule's pattern against it.  If you
think of this loop as a <code>for</code> statement whose body contains the
rules, then the <code>next</code> statement is analogous to a <code>continue</code>
statement. It skips to the end of the body of this implicit loop and
executes the increment (which reads another record).

   <p>For example, suppose an <span class="command">awk</span> program works only on records
with four fields, and it shouldn't fail when given bad input.  To avoid
complicating the rest of the program, write a &ldquo;weed out&rdquo; rule near
the beginning, in the following manner:

<pre class="example">     NF != 4 {
       err = sprintf("%s:%d: skipped: NF != 4\n", FILENAME, FNR)
       print err &gt; "/dev/stderr"
       next
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Because of the <code>next</code> statement,
the program's subsequent rules won't see the bad record.  The error
message is redirected to the standard error output stream, as error
messages should be.

<a href="#Special-Files">Special Files</a>.

the <code>next</code> statement is used in a <code>BEGIN</code> or <code>END</code> rule. 
<span class="command">gawk</span> treats it as a syntax error. 
Although POSIX permits it,
some other <span class="command">awk</span> implementations don't allow the <code>next</code>
statement inside function bodies
(see <a href="#User_002ddefined">User-defined</a>). 
Just as with any other <code>next</code> statement, a <code>next</code> statement inside a
function body reads the next record and starts processing it with the
first rule in the program. 
If the <code>next</code> statement causes the end of the input to be reached,
then the code in any <code>END</code> rules is executed.

<span class="command">gawk</span> provides the <code>nextfile</code> statement,
which is similar to the <code>next</code> statement. 
However, instead of abandoning processing of the current record, the
<code>nextfile</code> statement instructs <span class="command">gawk</span> to stop processing the
current data file.

   <p>The <code>nextfile</code> statement is a <span class="command">gawk</span> extension. 
In most other <span class="command">awk</span> implementations,
or if <span class="command">gawk</span> is in compatibility mode
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>),
<code>nextfile</code> is not special.

   <p>Upon execution of the <code>nextfile</code> statement, <code>FILENAME</code> is
updated to the name of the next data file listed on the command line,
<code>FNR</code> is reset to one, <code>ARGIND</code> is incremented, and processing
starts over with the first rule in the program. 
(<code>ARGIND</code> hasn't been introduced yet. See <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>.) 
If the <code>nextfile</code> statement causes the end of the input to be reached,
then the code in any <code>END</code> rules is executed. 
See <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>.

   <p>The <code>nextfile</code> statement is useful when there are many data files
to process but it isn't necessary to process every record in every file. 
Normally, in order to move on to the next data file, a program
has to continue scanning the unwanted records.  The <code>nextfile</code>
statement accomplishes this much more efficiently.

   <p>While one might think that <span class="samp">close(FILENAME)</span> would accomplish
the same as <code>nextfile</code>, this isn't true.  <code>close</code> is
reserved for closing files, pipes, and coprocesses that are
opened with redirections.  It is not related to the main processing that
<span class="command">awk</span> does with the files listed in <code>ARGV</code>.

   <p>If it's necessary to use an <span class="command">awk</span> version that doesn't support
<code>nextfile</code>, see
<a href="#Nextfile-Function">Nextfile Function</a>,
for a user-defined function that simulates the <code>nextfile</code>
statement.

also supports <code>nextfile</code>.  However, it doesn't allow the <code>nextfile</code>
statement inside function bodies
(see <a href="#User_002ddefined">User-defined</a>). 
<span class="command">gawk</span> does; a <code>nextfile</code> inside a
function body reads the next record and starts processing it with the
first rule in the program, just as any other <code>nextfile</code> statement.

words (<span class="samp">next file</span>) for the <code>nextfile</code> statement. 
In version 3.0, this was changed
to one word, because the treatment of <span class="samp">file</span> was
inconsistent. When it appeared after <code>next</code>, <span class="samp">file</span> was a keyword;
otherwise, it was a regular identifier.  The old usage is no longer
accepted; <span class="samp">next file</span> generates a syntax error.

<h4 class="subsection">6.4.10 The <code>exit</code> Statement</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bexit_007d-statement-986"></a>The <code>exit</code> statement causes <span class="command">awk</span> to immediately stop
executing the current rule and to stop processing input; any remaining input
is ignored.  The <code>exit</code> statement is written as follows:

<pre class="example">     exit <span class="roman">[</span><var>return code</var><span class="roman">]</span>
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern_002c-_0040code_007bexit_007d-statement-and-987"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bEND_007d-pattern_002c-_0040code_007bexit_007d-statement-and-988"></a>When an <code>exit</code> statement is executed from a <code>BEGIN</code> rule, the
program stops processing everything immediately.  No input records are
read.  However, if an <code>END</code> rule is present,
as part of executing the <code>exit</code> statement,
the <code>END</code> rule is executed
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>). 
If <code>exit</code> is used as part of an <code>END</code> rule, it causes
the program to stop immediately.

   <p>An <code>exit</code> statement that is not part of a <code>BEGIN</code> or <code>END</code>
rule stops the execution of any further automatic rules for the current
record, skips reading any remaining input records, and executes the
<code>END</code> rule if there is one.

   <p>In such a case,
if you don't want the <code>END</code> rule to do its job, set a variable
to nonzero before the <code>exit</code> statement and check that variable in
the <code>END</code> rule. 
See <a href="#Assert-Function">Assert Function</a>,
for an example that does this.

   <p><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-_0040code_007bexit_007d-statement-989"></a>If an argument is supplied to <code>exit</code>, its value is used as the exit
status code for the <span class="command">awk</span> process.  If no argument is supplied,
<code>exit</code> returns status zero (success).  In the case where an argument
is supplied to a first <code>exit</code> statement, and then <code>exit</code> is
called a second time from an <code>END</code> rule with no argument,
<span class="command">awk</span> uses the previously supplied exit value. 
(d.c.)

   <p><a name="index-programming-conventions_002c-_0040code_007bexit_007d-statement-990"></a>For example, suppose an error condition occurs that is difficult or
impossible to handle.  Conventionally, programs report this by
exiting with a nonzero status.  An <span class="command">awk</span> program can do this
using an <code>exit</code> statement with a nonzero argument, as shown
in the following example:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN {
            if (("date" | getline date_now) &lt;= 0) {
              print "Can't get system date" &gt; "/dev/stderr"
              exit 1
            }
            print "current date is", date_now
            close("date")
     }

Most <span class="command">awk</span> variables are available to use for your own
purposes; they never change unless your program assigns values to
them, and they never affect anything unless your program examines them. 
However, a few variables in <span class="command">awk</span> have special built-in meanings. 
<span class="command">awk</span> examines some of these automatically, so that they enable you
to tell <span class="command">awk</span> how to do certain things.  Others are set
automatically by <span class="command">awk</span>, so that they carry information from the
internal workings of <span class="command">awk</span> to your program.

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-built_002din-variables-and-993"></a>This section documents all the built-in variables of

The following is an alphabetical list of variables that you can change to

<dl><dt><code>BINMODE #</code><dd>On non-POSIX systems, this variable specifies use of binary mode for all I/O. 
Numeric values of one, two, or three specify that input files, output files, or
all files, respectively, should use binary I/O. 
Alternatively,
string values of <code>"r"</code> or <code>"w"</code> specify that input files and
output files, respectively, should use binary I/O. 
A string value of <code>"rw"</code> or <code>"wr"</code> indicates that all
files should use binary I/O. 
Any other string value is equivalent to <code>"rw"</code>, but <span class="command">gawk</span>
generates a warning message. 
<code>BINMODE</code> is described in more detail in

strings (see <a href="#Conversion">Conversion</a>). 
It works by being passed, in effect, as the first argument to the
<code>sprintf</code> function
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>). 
Its default value is <code>"%.6g"</code>. 
<code>CONVFMT</code> was introduced by the POSIX standard.

how to split input with fixed columnar boundaries. 
Assigning a value to <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code>
overrides the use of <code>FS</code> for field splitting. 
See <a href="#Constant-Size">Constant Size</a>, for more information.

     <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-_0040code_007bFIELDWIDTHS_007d-variable-in-1008"></a>If <span class="command">gawk</span> is in compatibility mode
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>), then <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code>
has no special meaning, and field-splitting operations occur based
exclusively on the value of <code>FS</code>.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bFS_007d-variable-1009"></a><a name="index-separators_002c-field-1010"></a><a name="index-field-separators-1011"></a><br><dt><code>FS</code><dd>This is the input field separator
(see <a href="#Field-Separators">Field Separators</a>). 
The value is a single-character string or a multi-character regular
expression that matches the separations between fields in an input
record.  If the value is the null string (<code>""</code>), then each
character in the record becomes a separate field. 
(This behavior is a <span class="command">gawk</span> extension. POSIX <span class="command">awk</span> does not
specify the behavior when <code>FS</code> is the null string.)

space.  As a special exception, this value means that any
sequence of spaces, tabs, and/or newlines is a single separator.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-29" name="fnd-29"><sup>29</sup></a>  It also causes
spaces, tabs, and newlines at the beginning and end of a record to be ignored.

     <p>You can set the value of <code>FS</code> on the command line using the
<span class="option">-F</span> option:

     <pre class="example">          awk -F, '<var>program</var>' <var>input-files</var>
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-field-separators-and-1013"></a>If <span class="command">gawk</span> is using <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code> for field splitting,
assigning a value to <code>FS</code> causes <span class="command">gawk</span> to return to
the normal, <code>FS</code>-based field splitting. An easy way to do this
is to simply say <span class="samp">FS = FS</span>, perhaps with an explanatory comment.

<code>gsub</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>match</code>, <code>split</code>, and <code>sub</code>
functions, record termination with <code>RS</code>, and field splitting with
<code>FS</code>, all ignore case when doing their particular regexp operations. 
However, the value of <code>IGNORECASE</code> does <em>not</em> affect array subscripting
and it does not affect field splitting when using a single-character
field separator. 
See <a href="#Case_002dsensitivity">Case-sensitivity</a>.

     <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-_0040code_007bIGNORECASE_007d-variable-in-1019"></a>If <span class="command">gawk</span> is in compatibility mode
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>),
then <code>IGNORECASE</code> has no special meaning.  Thus, string
and regexp operations are always case-sensitive.

With a value of <code>"fatal"</code>, lint warnings become fatal errors. 
With a value of <code>"invalid"</code>, only warnings about things that are
actually invalid are issued. (This is not fully implemented yet.) 
Any other true value prints nonfatal warnings. 
Assigning a false value to <code>LINT</code> turns off the lint warnings.

in other <span class="command">awk</span> implementations.  Unlike the other special variables,
changing <code>LINT</code> does affect the production of lint warnings,
even if <span class="command">gawk</span> is in compatibility mode.  Much as
the <span class="option">--lint</span> and <span class="option">--traditional</span> options independently
control different aspects of <span class="command">gawk</span>'s behavior, the control
of lint warnings during program execution is independent of the flavor

runs of blank lines. 
If it is a regexp, records are separated by

each time it reads a record, instead of setting them to the absolute
value of the number of records read.  This means that a program can
change these variables and their new values are incremented for
each record. 
(d.c.) 
This is demonstrated in the following example:

<pre class="example">     $ echo '1

(see <a href="#V7_002fSVR3_002e1">V7/SVR3.1</a>),
many <span class="command">awk</span> programs used this feature to track the number of

<a href="#Auto_002dset">Auto-set</a>,
presented the following program describing the information contained in <code>ARGC</code>
and <code>ARGV</code>:

<pre class="example">     $ awk 'BEGIN {
     &gt;        for (i = 0; i &lt; ARGC; i++)
     &gt;            print ARGV[i]
     &gt;      }' inventory-shipped BBS-list
     -| awk
     -| inventory-shipped
     -| BBS-list
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, <code>ARGV[0]</code> contains <span class="samp">awk</span>, <code>ARGV[1]</code>
contains <span class="samp">inventory-shipped</span>, and <code>ARGV[2]</code> contains
<span class="samp">BBS-list</span>. 
Notice that the <span class="command">awk</span> program is not entered in <code>ARGV</code>.  The
other special command-line options, with their arguments, are also not
entered.  This includes variable assignments done with the <span class="option">-v</span>
option (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>). 
Normal variable assignments on the command line <em>are</em>
treated as arguments and do show up in the <code>ARGV</code> array:

<pre class="example">     $ cat showargs.awk
     -| BEGIN {
     -|     printf "A=%d, B=%d\n", A, B
     -|     for (i = 0; i &lt; ARGC; i++)
     -|         printf "\tARGV[%d] = %s\n", i, ARGV[i]
     -| }
     -| END   { printf "A=%d, B=%d\n", A, B }
     $ awk -v A=1 -f showargs.awk B=2 /dev/null
     -| A=1, B=0
     -|        ARGV[0] = awk
     -|        ARGV[1] = B=2
     -|        ARGV[2] = /dev/null
     -| A=1, B=2
</pre>
   <p>A program can alter <code>ARGC</code> and the elements of <code>ARGV</code>. 
Each time <span class="command">awk</span> reaches the end of an input file, it uses the next
element of <code>ARGV</code> as the name of the next input file.  By storing a
different string there, a program can change which files are read. 
Use <code>"-"</code> to represent the standard input.  Storing
additional elements and incrementing <code>ARGC</code> causes
additional files to be read.

   <p>If the value of <code>ARGC</code> is decreased, that eliminates input files
from the end of the list.  By recording the old value of <code>ARGC</code>
elsewhere, a program can treat the eliminated arguments as
something other than file names.

   <p>To eliminate a file from the middle of the list, store the null string
(<code>""</code>) into <code>ARGV</code> in place of the file's name.  As a
special feature, <span class="command">awk</span> ignores file names that have been
replaced with the null string. 
Another option is to
use the <code>delete</code> statement to remove elements from
<code>ARGV</code> (see <a href="#Delete">Delete</a>).

   <p>All of these actions are typically done in the <code>BEGIN</code> rule,
before actual processing of the input begins. 
See <a href="#Split-Program">Split Program</a>, and see
<a href="#Tee-Program">Tee Program</a>, for examples
of each way of removing elements from <code>ARGV</code>. 
The following fragment processes <code>ARGV</code> in order to examine, and
then remove, command-line options:
<!-- NEXT ED: Add xref to rewind() function -->

<pre class="example">     BEGIN {
         for (i = 1; i &lt; ARGC; i++) {
             if (ARGV[i] == "-v")
                 verbose = 1
             else if (ARGV[i] == "-d")
                 debug = 1
             else if (ARGV[i] ~ /^-./) {
                 e = sprintf("%s: unrecognized option -- %c",
                         ARGV[0], substr(ARGV[i], 2, 1))
                 print e &gt; "/dev/stderr"
             } else
                 break
             delete ARGV[i]
         }
     }
</pre>
   <p>To actually get the options into the <span class="command">awk</span> program,
end the <span class="command">awk</span> options with <span class="option">--</span> and then supply
the <span class="command">awk</span> program's options, in the following manner:

<pre class="example">     awk -f myprog -- -v -d file1 file2 ...
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-_0040code_007bARGC_007d_002f_0040code_007bARGV_007d-variables-1075"></a>This is not necessary in <span class="command">gawk</span>. Unless <span class="option">--posix</span> has
been specified, <span class="command">gawk</span> silently puts any unrecognized options
into <code>ARGV</code> for the <span class="command">awk</span> program to deal with.  As soon
as it sees an unknown option, <span class="command">gawk</span> stops looking for other
options that it might otherwise recognize.  The previous example with
<span class="command">gawk</span> would be:

<pre class="example">     gawk -f myprog -d -v file1 file2 ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Because <span class="option">-d</span> is not a valid <span class="command">gawk</span> option,
it and the following <span class="option">-v</span>
are passed on to the <span class="command">awk</span> program.

<h3 class="section">7.1 Introduction to Arrays</h3>

<p>The <span class="command">awk</span> language provides one-dimensional arrays
for storing groups of related strings or numbers. 
Every <span class="command">awk</span> array must have a name.  Array names have the same
syntax as variable names; any valid variable name would also be a valid
array name.  But one name cannot be used in both ways (as an array and
as a variable) in the same <span class="command">awk</span> program.

   <p>Arrays in <span class="command">awk</span> superficially resemble arrays in other programming
languages, but there are fundamental differences.  In <span class="command">awk</span>, it
isn't necessary to specify the size of an array before starting to use it. 
Additionally, any number or string in <span class="command">awk</span>, not just consecutive integers,
may be used as an array index.

   <p>In most other languages, arrays must be <dfn>declared</dfn> before use,
including a specification of
how many elements or components they contain.  In such languages, the
declaration causes a contiguous block of memory to be allocated for that
many elements.  Usually, an index in the array must be a positive integer. 
For example, the index zero specifies the first element in the array, which is
actually stored at the beginning of the block of memory.  Index one
specifies the second element, which is stored in memory right after the
first element, and so on.  It is impossible to add more elements to the
array, because it has room only for as many elements as given in
the declaration. 
(Some languages allow arbitrary starting and ending
indices&mdash;e.g., <span class="samp">15 .. 27</span>&mdash;but the size of the array is still fixed when
the array is declared.)

   <p>A contiguous array of four elements might look like the following example,
conceptually, if the element values are 8, <code>"foo"</code>,
<code>""</code>, and 30:

<!-- NEXT ED: Use real images here -->
<p class="noindent">Only the values are stored; the indices are implicit from the order of
the values. Here, 8 is the value at index zero, because 8 appears in the
position with zero elements before it.

that each array is a collection of pairs: an index and its corresponding
array element value:

<pre class="example">     <span class="roman">Element</span> 3     <span class="roman">Value</span> 30

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The pairs are shown in jumbled order because their order is irrelevant.

   <p>One advantage of associative arrays is that new pairs can be added
at any time.  For example, suppose a tenth element is added to the array
whose value is <code>"number&nbsp;ten"</code><!-- /@w -->.  The result is:

<pre class="example">     <span class="roman">Element</span> 10    <span class="roman">Value</span> "number ten"
     <span class="roman">Element</span> 3     <span class="roman">Value</span> 30
     <span class="roman">Element</span> 1     <span class="roman">Value</span> "foo"
     <span class="roman">Element</span> 0     <span class="roman">Value</span> 8
     <span class="roman">Element</span> 2     <span class="roman">Value</span> ""
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-sparse-arrays-1086"></a><a name="index-arrays_002c-sparse-1087"></a>Now the array is <dfn>sparse</dfn>, which just means some indices are missing. 
It has elements 0&ndash;3 and 10, but doesn't have elements 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

   <p>Another consequence of associative arrays is that the indices don't
have to be positive integers.  Any number, or even a string, can be
an index.  For example, the following is an array that translates words from
English to French:

<pre class="example">     <span class="roman">Element</span> "dog" <span class="roman">Value</span> "chien"
     <span class="roman">Element</span> "cat" <span class="roman">Value</span> "chat"
     <span class="roman">Element</span> "one" <span class="roman">Value</span> "un"
     <span class="roman">Element</span> 1     <span class="roman">Value</span> "un"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here we decided to translate the number one in both spelled-out and
numeric form&mdash;thus illustrating that a single array can have both
numbers and strings as indices. 
In fact, array subscripts are always strings; this is discussed
in more detail in
<a href="#Numeric-Array-Subscripts">Numeric Array Subscripts</a>. 
Here, the number <code>1</code> isn't double-quoted, since <span class="command">awk</span>
automatically converts it to a string.

   <p><a name="index-case-sensitivity_002c-array-indices-and-1088"></a><a name="index-arrays_002c-_0040code_007bIGNORECASE_007d-variable-and-1089"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bIGNORECASE_007d-variable_002c-array-subscripts-and-1090"></a>The value of <code>IGNORECASE</code> has no effect upon array subscripting. 
The identical string value used to store an array element must be used
to retrieve it. 
When <span class="command">awk</span> creates an array (e.g., with the <code>split</code>
built-in function),
that array's indices are consecutive integers starting at one. 
(See <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>.)

   <p><span class="command">awk</span>'s arrays are efficient&mdash;the time to access an element
is independent of the number of elements in the array.

<h3 class="section">7.2 Referring to an Array Element</h3>

<p><a name="index-arrays_002c-elements_002c-referencing-1091"></a><a name="index-elements-in-arrays-1092"></a>
The principal way to use an array is to refer to one of its elements. 
An array reference is an expression as follows:

<pre class="example">     <var>array</var>[<var>index</var>]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, <var>array</var> is the name of an array.  The expression <var>index</var> is
the index of the desired element of the array.

   <p>The value of the array reference is the current value of that array
element.  For example, <code>foo[4.3]</code> is an expression for the element
of array <code>foo</code> at index <span class="samp">4.3</span>.

   <p>A reference to an array element that has no recorded value yields a value of
<code>""</code>, the null string.  This includes elements
that have not been assigned any value as well as elements that have been
deleted (see <a href="#Delete">Delete</a>).  Such a reference
automatically creates that array element, with the null string as its value. 
(In some cases, this is unfortunate, because it might waste memory inside
<span class="command">awk</span>.)

<!-- @cindex arrays, @code{in} operator and -->
<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bin_007d-operator_002c-arrays-and-1093"></a>To determine whether an element exists in an array at a certain index, use
the following expression:

<pre class="example">     <var>index</var> in <var>array</var>
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-side-effects_002c-array-indexing-1094"></a>This expression tests whether the particular index exists,
without the side effect of creating that element if it is not present. 
The expression has the value one (true) if <var>array</var><code>[</code><var>index</var><code>]</code>
exists and zero (false) if it does not exist. 
For example, this statement tests whether the array <code>frequencies</code>
contains the index <span class="samp">2</span>:

<pre class="example">     if (2 in frequencies)
         print "Subscript 2 is present."
</pre>
   <p>Note that this is <em>not</em> a test of whether the array
<code>frequencies</code> contains an element whose <em>value</em> is two. 
There is no way to do that except to scan all the elements.  Also, this
<em>does not</em> create <code>frequencies[2]</code>, while the following
(incorrect) alternative does:

<pre class="example">     if (frequencies[2] != "")
         print "Subscript 2 is present."

</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><var>array</var> is the name of an array.  The expression

<h3 class="section">7.4 Basic Array Example</h3>

<p>The following program takes a list of lines, each beginning with a line
number, and prints them out in order of line number.  The line numbers
are not in order when they are first read&mdash;instead they
are scrambled.  This program sorts the lines by making an array using
the line numbers as subscripts.  The program then prints out the lines
in sorted order of their numbers.  It is a very simple program and gets
confused upon encountering repeated numbers, gaps, or lines that don't
begin with a number:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/misc/arraymax.awk -->
     {
       if ($1 &gt; max)
         max = $1
       arr[$1] = $0
     }
     
     END {
       for (x = 1; x &lt;= max; x++)
         print arr[x]
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The first rule keeps track of the largest line number seen so far;
it also stores each line into the array <code>arr</code>, at an index that
is the line's number. 
The second rule runs after all the input has been read, to print out
all the lines. 
When this program is run with the following input:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/misc/arraymax.data -->
     5  I am the Five man
     2  Who are you?  The new number two!
     4  . . . And four on the floor
     1  Who is number one?
     3  I three you.
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Its output is:

<pre class="example">     1  Who is number one?
     2  Who are you?  The new number two!
     3  I three you.
     4  . . . And four on the floor
     5  I am the Five man
</pre>
   <p>If a line number is repeated, the last line with a given number overrides
the others. 
Gaps in the line numbers can be handled with an easy improvement to the
program's <code>END</code> rule, as follows:

<pre class="example">     END {
       for (x = 1; x &lt;= max; x++)
         if (x in arr)
           print arr[x]
     }

<h3 class="section">7.5 Scanning All Elements of an Array</h3>

<p><a name="index-elements-in-arrays_002c-scanning-1097"></a><a name="index-arrays_002c-scanning-1098"></a>
In programs that use arrays, it is often necessary to use a loop that
executes once for each element of an array.  In other languages, where
arrays are contiguous and indices are limited to positive integers,
this is easy: all the valid indices can be found by counting from
the lowest index up to the highest.  This technique won't do the job
in <span class="command">awk</span>, because any number or string can be an array index. 
So <span class="command">awk</span> has a special kind of <code>for</code> statement for scanning
an array:

<pre class="example">     for (<var>var</var> in <var>array</var>)
       <var>body</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-_0040code_007bin_007d-operator_002c-arrays-and-1099"></a>This loop executes <var>body</var> once for each index in <var>array</var> that the
program has previously used, with the variable <var>var</var> set to that index.

   <p><a name="index-arrays_002c-_0040code_007bfor_007d-statement-and-1100"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bfor_007d-statement_002c-in-arrays-1101"></a>The following program uses this form of the <code>for</code> statement.  The
first rule scans the input records and notes which words appear (at
least once) in the input, by storing a one into the array <code>used</code> with
the word as index.  The second rule scans the elements of <code>used</code> to
find all the distinct words that appear in the input.  It prints each
word that is more than 10 characters long and also prints the number of
such words. 
See <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>,
for more information on the built-in function <code>length</code>.

<pre class="example">     # Record a 1 for each word that is used at least once
     {
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i++)
             used[$i] = 1
     }
     
     # Find number of distinct words more than 10 characters long
     END {
         for (x in used)
             if (length(x) &gt; 10) {
                 ++num_long_words
                 print x
             }
         print num_long_words, "words longer than 10 characters"
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">See <a href="#Word-Sorting">Word Sorting</a>,
for a more detailed example of this type.

   <p><a name="index-arrays_002c-elements_002c-order-of-1102"></a><a name="index-elements-in-arrays_002c-order-of-1103"></a>The order in which elements of the array are accessed by this statement
is determined by the internal arrangement of the array elements within
<span class="command">awk</span> and cannot be controlled or changed.  This can lead to
problems if new elements are added to <var>array</var> by statements in
the loop body; it is not predictable whether the <code>for</code> loop will
reach them.  Similarly, changing <var>var</var> inside the loop may produce
strange results.  It is best to avoid such things.

<h3 class="section">7.6 The <code>delete</code> Statement</h3>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bdelete_007d-statement-1104"></a><a name="index-deleting-elements-in-arrays-1105"></a><a name="index-arrays_002c-elements_002c-deleting-1106"></a><a name="index-elements-in-arrays_002c-deleting-1107"></a>
To remove an individual element of an array, use the <code>delete</code>
statement:

<pre class="example">     delete <var>array</var>[<var>index</var>]
</pre>
   <p>Once an array element has been deleted, any value the element once
had is no longer available. It is as if the element had never
been referred to or had been given a value. 
The following is an example of deleting elements in an array:

<pre class="example">     for (i in frequencies)
       delete frequencies[i]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This example removes all the elements from the array <code>frequencies</code>. 
Once an element is deleted, a subsequent <code>for</code> statement to scan the array
does not report that element and the <code>in</code> operator to check for
the presence of that element returns zero (i.e., false):

<pre class="example">     delete foo[4]
     if (4 in foo)
         print "This will never be printed"
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-null-strings_002c-array-elements-and-1108"></a>It is important to note that deleting an element is <em>not</em> the
same as assigning it a null value (the empty string, <code>""</code>). 
For example:

<pre class="example">     foo[4] = ""
     if (4 in foo)
       print "This is printed, even though foo[4] is empty"
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-lint-checking_002c-array-elements-1109"></a>It is not an error to delete an element that does not exist. 
If <span class="option">--lint</span> is provided on the command line
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>),
<span class="command">gawk</span> issues a warning message when an element that
is not in the array is deleted.

   <p><a name="index-arrays_002c-deleting-entire-contents-1110"></a><a name="index-deleting-entire-arrays-1111"></a><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-array-elements_002c-deleting-1112"></a>All the elements of an array may be deleted with a single statement
by leaving off the subscript in the <code>delete</code> statement,
as follows:

<pre class="example">     delete <var>array</var>
</pre>
   <p>This ability is a <span class="command">gawk</span> extension; it is not available in
compatibility mode (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>).

   <p>Using this version of the <code>delete</code> statement is about three times
more efficient than the equivalent loop that deletes each element one
at a time.

   <p><a name="index-portability_002c-deleting-array-elements-1113"></a><a name="index-Brennan_002c-Michael-1114"></a>The following statement provides a portable but nonobvious way to clear
out an array:<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-31" name="fnd-31"><sup>31</sup></a>

<pre class="example">     split("", array)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bsplit_007d-function_002c-array-elements_0040comma_007b_007d-deleting-1115"></a>The <code>split</code> function
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>)
clears out the target array first. This call asks it to split
apart the null string. Because there is no data to split out, the
function simply clears the array and then returns.

   <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Deleting an array does not change its type; you cannot
delete an array and then use the array's name as a scalar
(i.e., a regular variable). For example, the following does not work:

<pre class="example">     a[1] = 3; delete a; a = 3

<h3 class="section">7.7 Using Numbers to Subscript Arrays</h3>

<p><a name="index-numbers_002c-as-array-subscripts-1116"></a><a name="index-arrays_002c-subscripts-1117"></a><a name="index-subscripts-in-arrays_002c-numbers-as-1118"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bCONVFMT_007d-variable_002c-array-subscripts-and-1119"></a>An important aspect about arrays to remember is that <em>array subscripts
are always strings</em>.  When a numeric value is used as a subscript,
it is converted to a string value before being used for subscripting
(see <a href="#Conversion">Conversion</a>). 
This means that the value of the built-in variable <code>CONVFMT</code> can
affect how your program accesses elements of an array.  For example:

<pre class="example">     xyz = 12.153
     data[xyz] = 1
     CONVFMT = "%2.2f"
     if (xyz in data)
         printf "%s is in data\n", xyz
     else
         printf "%s is not in data\n", xyz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This prints <span class="samp">12.15 is not in data</span>.  The first statement gives
<code>xyz</code> a numeric value.  Assigning to
<code>data[xyz]</code> subscripts <code>data</code> with the string value <code>"12.153"</code>
(using the default conversion value of <code>CONVFMT</code>, <code>"%.6g"</code>). 
Thus, the array element <code>data["12.153"]</code> is assigned the value one. 
The program then changes
the value of <code>CONVFMT</code>.  The test <span class="samp">(xyz in data)</span> generates a new
string value from <code>xyz</code>&mdash;this time <code>"12.15"</code>&mdash;because the value of
<code>CONVFMT</code> only allows two significant digits.  This test fails,
since <code>"12.15"</code> is a different string from <code>"12.153"</code>.

   <p><a name="index-converting_002c-during-subscripting-1120"></a>According to the rules for conversions
(see <a href="#Conversion">Conversion</a>), integer
values are always converted to strings as integers, no matter what the
value of <code>CONVFMT</code> may happen to be.  So the usual case of
the following works:

<pre class="example">     for (i = 1; i &lt;= maxsub; i++)
         <i>do something with</i> array[i]
</pre>
   <p>The &ldquo;integer values always convert to strings as integers&rdquo; rule
has an additional consequence for array indexing. 
Octal and hexadecimal constants
(see <a href="#Nondecimal_002dnumbers">Nondecimal-numbers</a>)
are converted internally into numbers, and their original form
is forgotten. 
This means, for example, that
<code>array[17]</code>,
<code>array[021]</code>,
and
<code>array[0x11]</code>
all refer to the same element!

   <p>As with many things in <span class="command">awk</span>, the majority of the time
things work as one would expect them to.  But it is useful to have a precise
knowledge of the actual rules which sometimes can have a subtle
effect on your programs.

to print the input data in reverse order. 
A reasonable attempt to do so (with some test
data) might look like this:

<pre class="example">     $ echo 'line 1
     &gt; line 2
     &gt; line 3' | awk '{ l[lines] = $0; ++lines }
     &gt; END {
     &gt;     for (i = lines-1; i &gt;= 0; --i)
     &gt;        print l[i]
     &gt; }'
     -| line 3
     -| line 2
</pre>
   <p>Unfortunately, the very first line of input data did not come out in the
output!

   <p>At first glance, this program should have worked.  The variable <code>lines</code>
is uninitialized, and uninitialized variables have the numeric value zero. 
So, <span class="command">awk</span> should have printed the value of <code>l[0]</code>.

   <p>The issue here is that subscripts for <span class="command">awk</span> arrays are <em>always</em>
strings. Uninitialized variables, when used as strings, have the
value <code>""</code>, not zero.  Thus, <span class="samp">line 1</span> ends up stored in
<code>l[""]</code>. 
The following version of the program works correctly:

<pre class="example">     { l[lines++] = $0 }
     END {
         for (i = lines - 1; i &gt;= 0; --i)
            print l[i]
     }
</pre>
   <p>Here, the <span class="samp">++</span> forces <code>lines</code> to be numeric, thus making
the &ldquo;old value&rdquo; numeric zero. This is then converted to <code>"0"</code>
as the array subscript.

   <p><a name="index-null-strings_002c-as-array-subscripts-1125"></a><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-array-subscripts-1126"></a><a name="index-lint-checking_002c-array-subscripts-1127"></a>Even though it is somewhat unusual, the null string
(<code>""</code>) is a valid array subscript. 
(d.c.) 
<span class="command">gawk</span> warns about the use of the null string as a subscript
if <span class="option">--lint</span> is provided
on the command line (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>).

<p><a name="index-subscripts-in-arrays_002c-multidimensional-1128"></a><a name="index-arrays_002c-multidimensional-1129"></a>A multidimensional array is an array in which an element is identified
by a sequence of indices instead of a single index.  For example, a
two-dimensional array requires two indices.  The usual way (in most
languages, including <span class="command">awk</span>) to refer to an element of a
two-dimensional array named <code>grid</code> is with
<code>grid[</code><var>x</var><code>,</code><var>y</var><code>]</code>.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bSUBSEP_007d-variable_002c-multidimensional-arrays-1130"></a>Multidimensional arrays are supported in <span class="command">awk</span> through
concatenation of indices into one string. 
<span class="command">awk</span> converts the indices into strings
(see <a href="#Conversion">Conversion</a>) and
concatenates them together, with a separator between them.  This creates
a single string that describes the values of the separate indices.  The
combined string is used as a single index into an ordinary,
one-dimensional array.  The separator used is the value of the built-in
variable <code>SUBSEP</code>.

   <p>For example, suppose we evaluate the expression <span class="samp">foo[5,12] = "value"</span>
when the value of <code>SUBSEP</code> is <code>"@"</code>.  The numbers 5 and 12 are
converted to strings and
concatenated with an <span class="samp">@</span> between them, yielding <code>"5@12"</code>; thus,
the array element <code>foo["5@12"]</code> is set to <code>"value"</code>.

   <p>Once the element's value is stored, <span class="command">awk</span> has no record of whether
it was stored with a single index or a sequence of indices.  The two
expressions <span class="samp">foo[5,12]</span> and <span class="samp">foo[5&nbsp;SUBSEP&nbsp;12]</span><!-- /@w --> are always
equivalent.

   <p>The default value of <code>SUBSEP</code> is the string <code>"\034"</code>,
which contains a nonprinting character that is unlikely to appear in an
<span class="command">awk</span> program or in most input data. 
The usefulness of choosing an unlikely character comes from the fact
that index values that contain a string matching <code>SUBSEP</code> can lead to
combined strings that are ambiguous.  Suppose that <code>SUBSEP</code> is
<code>"@"</code>; then <span class="samp">foo["a@b",&nbsp;"c"]</span><!-- /@w --> and <span class="samp">foo["a",&nbsp;"b@c"]</span><!-- /@w --> are indistinguishable because both are actually
stored as <span class="samp">foo["a@b@c"]</span>.

   <p>To test whether a particular index sequence exists in a
multidimensional array, use the same operator (<span class="samp">in</span>) that is
used for single dimensional arrays.  Write the whole sequence of indices
in parentheses, separated by commas, as the left operand:

<pre class="example">     (<var>subscript1</var>, <var>subscript2</var>, ...) in <var>array</var>
</pre>
   <p>The following example treats its input as a two-dimensional array of
fields; it rotates this array 90 degrees clockwise and prints the
result.  It assumes that all lines have the same number of
elements:

<pre class="example">     {
          if (max_nf &lt; NF)
               max_nf = NF
          max_nr = NR
          for (x = 1; x &lt;= NF; x++)
               vector[x, NR] = $x
     }
     
     END {
          for (x = 1; x &lt;= max_nf; x++) {
               for (y = max_nr; y &gt;= 1; --y)
                    printf("%s ", vector[x, y])
               printf("\n")
          }
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When given the input:

<pre class="example">     1 2 3 4 5 6
     2 3 4 5 6 1
     3 4 5 6 1 2
     4 5 6 1 2 3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the program produces the following output:

<pre class="example">     4 3 2 1
     5 4 3 2
     6 5 4 3
     1 6 5 4
     2 1 6 5

<h3 class="section">7.10 Scanning Multidimensional Arrays</h3>

<p>There is no special <code>for</code> statement for scanning a
&ldquo;multidimensional&rdquo; array. There cannot be one, because, in truth, there
are no multidimensional arrays or elements&mdash;there is only a
multidimensional <em>way of accessing</em> an array.

   <p><a name="index-subscripts-in-arrays_002c-multidimensional_002c-scanning-1131"></a><a name="index-arrays_002c-multidimensional_002c-scanning-1132"></a>However, if your program has an array that is always accessed as
multidimensional, you can get the effect of scanning it by combining
the scanning <code>for</code> statement
(see <a href="#Scanning-an-Array">Scanning an Array</a>) with the
built-in <code>split</code> function
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>). 
It works in the following manner:

<pre class="example">     for (combined in array) {
         split(combined, separate, SUBSEP)
         ...
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This sets the variable <code>combined</code> to
each concatenated combined index in the array, and splits it
into the individual indices by breaking it apart where the value of
<code>SUBSEP</code> appears.  The individual indices then become the elements of
the array <code>separate</code>.

   <p>Thus, if a value is previously stored in <code>array[1, "foo"]</code>; then
an element with index <code>"1\034foo"</code> exists in <code>array</code>.  (Recall
that the default value of <code>SUBSEP</code> is the character with code 034.) 
Sooner or later, the <code>for</code> statement finds that index and does an
iteration with the variable <code>combined</code> set to <code>"1\034foo"</code>. 
Then the <code>split</code> function is called as follows:

<pre class="example">     split("1\034foo", separate, "\034")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The result is to set <code>separate[1]</code> to <code>"1"</code> and
<code>separate[2]</code> to <code>"foo"</code>.  Presto! The original sequence of
separate indices is recovered.

<h3 class="section">7.11 Sorting Array Values and Indices with <span class="command">gawk</span></h3>

<p><a name="index-arrays_002c-sorting-1133"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007basort_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029-1134"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007basort_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029_002c-arrays_0040comma_007b_007d-sorting-1135"></a><a name="index-sort-function_002c-arrays_002c-sorting-1136"></a>The order in which an array is scanned with a <span class="samp">for (i in array)</span>
loop is essentially arbitrary. 
In most <span class="command">awk</span> implementations, sorting an array requires
writing a <code>sort</code> function. 
While this can be educational for exploring different sorting algorithms,
usually that's not the point of the program. 
<span class="command">gawk</span> provides the built-in <code>asort</code>
and <code>asorti</code> functions
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>)
for sorting arrays.  For example:

<pre class="example">     <var>populate the array</var> data
     n = asort(data)
     for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++)
         <var>do something with</var> data[i]
</pre>
   <p>After the call to <code>asort</code>, the array <code>data</code> is indexed from 1
to some number <var>n</var>, the total number of elements in <code>data</code>. 
(This count is <code>asort</code>'s return value.) 
<code>data[1]</code> &lt;= <code>data[2]</code> &lt;= <code>data[3]</code>, and so on. 
The comparison of array elements is done
using <span class="command">gawk</span>'s usual comparison rules
(see <a href="#Typing-and-Comparison">Typing and Comparison</a>).

   <p><a name="index-side-effects_002c-_0040code_007basort_007d-function-1137"></a>An important side effect of calling <code>asort</code> is that
<em>the array's original indices are irrevocably lost</em>. 
As this isn't always desirable, <code>asort</code> accepts a
second argument:

<pre class="example">     <var>populate the array</var> source
     n = asort(source, dest)
     for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++)
         <var>do something with</var> dest[i]
</pre>
   <p>In this case, <span class="command">gawk</span> copies the <code>source</code> array into the
<code>dest</code> array and then sorts <code>dest</code>, destroying its indices. 
However, the <code>source</code> array is not affected.

   <p>Often, what's needed is to sort on the values of the <em>indices</em>
instead of the values of the elements. 
To do that, starting with <span class="command">gawk</span> 3.1.2, use the
<code>asorti</code> function.  The interface is identical to that of
<code>asort</code>, except that the index values are used for sorting, and
become the values of the result array:

<pre class="example">     { source[$0] = some_func($0) }
     
     END {
         n = asorti(source, dest)
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
             <var>do something with</var> dest[i]             <i>Work with sorted indices directly</i>
             ...
             <var>do something with</var> source[dest[i]]     <i>Access original array via sorted indices</i>
         }
     }
</pre>
   <p>If your version of <span class="command">gawk</span> is 3.1.0 or 3.1.1, you don't
have <code>asorti</code>. Instead, use a helper array
to hold the sorted index values, and then access the original array's
elements.  It works in the following way:

<pre class="example">     <var>populate the array</var> data
     # copy indices
     j = 1
     for (i in data) {
         ind[j] = i    # index value becomes element value
         j++
     }
     n = asort(ind)    # index values are now sorted
     for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
         <var>do something with</var> ind[i]           <i>Work with sorted indices directly</i>
         ...
         <var>do something with</var> data[ind[i]]     <i>Access original array via sorted indices</i>
     }
</pre>
   <p>Sorting the array by replacing the indices provides maximal flexibility. 
To traverse the elements in decreasing order, use a loop that goes from
<var>n</var> down to 1, either over the elements or over the indices.

   <p><a name="index-reference-counting_002c-sorting-arrays-1138"></a>Copying array indices and elements isn't expensive in terms of memory. 
Internally, <span class="command">gawk</span> maintains <dfn>reference counts</dfn> to data. 
For example, when <code>asort</code> copies the first array to the second one,
there is only one copy of the original array elements' data, even though
both arrays use the values.  Similarly, when copying the indices from
<code>data</code> to <code>ind</code>, there is only one copy of the actual index
strings.

<!-- Document It And Call It A Feature. Sigh. -->
<p><a name="index-arrays_002c-sorting_002c-_0040code_007bIGNORECASE_007d-variable-and-1139"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bIGNORECASE_007d-variable_002c-array-sorting-and-1140"></a>We said previously that comparisons are done using <span class="command">gawk</span>'s
&ldquo;usual comparison rules.&rdquo;  Because <code>IGNORECASE</code> affects
string comparisons, the value of <code>IGNORECASE</code> also
affects sorting for both <code>asort</code> and <code>asorti</code>. 
Caveat Emptor.

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.1 Calling Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>To call one of <span class="command">awk</span>'s built-in functions, write the name of
the function followed
by arguments in parentheses.  For example, <span class="samp">atan2(y + z, 1)</span>
is a call to the function <code>atan2</code> and has two arguments.

   <p><a name="index-programming-conventions_002c-functions_002c-calling-1143"></a><a name="index-whitespace_002c-functions_0040comma_007b_007d-calling-1144"></a>Whitespace is ignored between the built-in function name and the
open parenthesis, and it is good practice to avoid using whitespace
there.  User-defined functions do not permit whitespace in this way, and
it is easier to avoid mistakes by following a simple
convention that always works&mdash;no whitespace after a function name.

   <p><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-fatal-errors_0040comma_007b_007d-function-arguments-1145"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-function-arguments-and-1146"></a><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-function-arguments-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029-1147"></a>Each built-in function accepts a certain number of arguments. 
In some cases, arguments can be omitted. The defaults for omitted
arguments vary from function to function and are described under the
individual functions.  In some <span class="command">awk</span> implementations, extra
arguments given to built-in functions are ignored.  However, in <span class="command">gawk</span>,
it is a fatal error to give extra arguments to a built-in function.

   <p>When a function is called, expressions that create the function's actual
parameters are evaluated completely before the call is performed. 
For example, in the following code fragment:

<pre class="example">     i = 4
     j = sqrt(i++)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-evaluation-order_002c-functions-1148"></a><a name="index-functions_002c-built_002din_002c-evaluation-order-1149"></a><a name="index-built_002din-functions_002c-evaluation-order-1150"></a>the variable <code>i</code> is incremented to the value five before <code>sqrt</code>
is called with a value of four for its actual parameter. 
The order of evaluation of the expressions used for the function's
parameters is undefined.  Thus, avoid writing programs that
assume that parameters are evaluated from left to right or from
right to left.  For example:

<pre class="example">     i = 5
     j = atan2(i++, i *= 2)
</pre>
   <p>If the order of evaluation is left to right, then <code>i</code> first becomes
6, and then 12, and <code>atan2</code> is called with the two arguments 6
and 12.  But if the order of evaluation is right to left, <code>i</code>
first becomes 10, then 11, and <code>atan2</code> is called with the
two arguments 11 and 10.

     <p>Often random integers are needed instead.  Following is a user-defined function

<strong>Caution:</strong> In most <span class="command">awk</span> implementations, including <span class="command">gawk</span>,
<code>rand</code> starts generating numbers from the same
starting number, or <dfn>seed</dfn>, each time you run <span class="command">awk</span>.  Thus,
a program generates the same results each time you run it. 
The numbers are random within one <span class="command">awk</span> run but predictable
from run to run.  This is convenient for debugging, but if you want
a program to do different things each time it is used, you must change
the seed to a value that is different in each run.  To do this,
use <code>srand</code>.

the same sequence of random numbers is produced again.

     <p>Different <span class="command">awk</span> implementations use different random-number
generators internally.  Don't expect the same <span class="command">awk</span> program
to produce the same series of random numbers when executed by
different versions of <span class="command">awk</span>.

     <p>If the argument <var>x</var> is omitted, as in <span class="samp">srand()</span>, then the current
date and time of day are used for a seed.  This is the way to get random
numbers that are truly unpredictable.

     <p>The return value of <code>srand</code> is the previous seed.  This makes it
easy to keep track of the seeds in case you need to consistently reproduce
sequences of random numbers.

It works similarly to <code>asort</code>, however, the <em>indices</em>

the comparison performed is always a string comparison.  (Here too,
<code>IGNORECASE</code> affects the sorting.)

     <p>The <code>asorti</code> function is described in more detail in

It was added in <span class="command">gawk</span> 3.1.2.

     <p><a name="index-differences-between-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bawk_007d-1171"></a>Beginning with <span class="command">gawk</span> version 3.2, when supplied an

     <p>The order of the first two arguments is backwards from most other string
functions that work with regular expressions, such as
<code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code>.  It might help to remember that
for <code>match</code>, the order is the same as for the <span class="samp">~</span> operator:
<var>string</var><span class="samp"> ~ </span><var>regexp</var>.

the index.  It also sets the built-in variable <code>RLENGTH</code> to the
length in characters of the matched substring.  If no match is found,
<code>RSTART</code> is set to zero, and <code>RLENGTH</code> to &minus;1.

     <p>For example:

     </pre>
     <p>There may not be subscripts for the start and index for every parenthesized

should be tested for with the <code>in</code> operator
(see <a href="#Reference-to-Elements">Reference to Elements</a>).

     <p>Note, however, that <code>RS</code> has no effect on the way <code>split</code>
works. Even though <span class="samp">RS = ""</span> causes newline to also be an input
field separator, this does not affect how <code>split</code> splits strings.

     <p>Before splitting the string, <code>split</code> deletes any previously existing

     <p>If <var>string</var> is null, the array has no elements. (So this is a portable
way to delete an entire array with one statement.

     <p>If <var>string</var> does not match <var>fieldsep</var> at all (but is not null),

to put it.  Such versions of <span class="command">awk</span> accept expressions
such as the following:

     <pre class="example">          sub(/USA/, "United States", "the USA and Canada")
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent"><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-_0040code_007bgsub_007d_002f_0040code_007bsub_007d-functions-1189"></a>For historical compatibility, <span class="command">gawk</span> accepts erroneous code,
such as in the previous example. However, using any other nonchangeable
object as the third parameter causes a fatal error and your program
will not run.

     <p>Finally, if the <var>regexp</var> is not a regexp constant, it is converted into a
string, and then the value of that string is treated as the regexp to match.

     <br><dt><code>gsub(</code><var>regexp</var><code>, </code><var>replacement</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code>, </code><var>target</var><span class="roman">]</span><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bgsub_007d-function-1190"></a>This is similar to the <code>sub</code> function, except <code>gsub</code> replaces
<em>all</em> of the longest, leftmost, <em>nonoverlapping</em> matching
substrings it can find.  The <span class="samp">g</span> in <code>gsub</code> stands for
&ldquo;global,&rdquo; which means replace everywhere.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          { gsub(/Britain/, "United Kingdom"); print }
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">replaces all occurrences of the string <span class="samp">Britain</span> with <span class="samp">United
Kingdom</span> for all input records.

     <p>The <code>gsub</code> function returns the number of substitutions made.  If
the variable to search and alter (<var>target</var>) is
omitted, then the entire input record (<code>$0</code>) is used. 
As in <code>sub</code>, the characters <span class="samp">&amp;</span> and <span class="samp">\</span> are special,
and the third argument must be assignable.

     <br><dt><code>gensub(</code><var>regexp</var><code>, </code><var>replacement</var><code>, </code><var>how</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code>, </code><var>target</var><span class="roman">]</span><code>) #</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bgensub_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029-1191"></a><code>gensub</code> is a general substitution function.  Like <code>sub</code> and
<code>gsub</code>, it searches the target string <var>target</var> for matches of
the regular expression <var>regexp</var>.  Unlike <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code>,
the modified string is returned as the result of the function and the
original target string is <em>not</em> changed.  If <var>how</var> is a string
beginning with <span class="samp">g</span> or <span class="samp">G</span>, then it replaces all matches of
<var>regexp</var> with <var>replacement</var>.  Otherwise, <var>how</var> is treated
as a number that indicates which match of <var>regexp</var> to replace. If
no <var>target</var> is supplied, <code>$0</code> is used.

     <p><code>gensub</code> provides an additional feature that is not available
in <code>sub</code> or <code>gsub</code>: the ability to specify components of a
regexp in the replacement text.  This is done by using parentheses in
the regexp to mark the components and then specifying <span class="samp">\</span><var>N</var>
in the replacement text, where <var>N</var> is a digit from 1 to 9. 
For example:

     <pre class="example">          $ gawk '
          &gt; BEGIN {
          &gt;      a = "abc def"
          &gt;      b = gensub(/(.+) (.+)/, "\\2 \\1", "g", a)
          &gt;      print b
          &gt; }'
          -| def abc
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">As with <code>sub</code>, you must type two backslashes in order
to get one into the string. 
In the replacement text, the sequence <span class="samp">\0</span> represents the entire
matched text, as does the character <span class="samp">&amp;</span>.

     <p>The following example shows how you can use the third argument to control
which match of the regexp should be changed:

     <pre class="example">          $ echo a b c a b c |
          &gt; gawk '{ print gensub(/a/, "AA", 2) }'
          -| a b c AA b c
     </pre>
     <p>In this case, <code>$0</code> is used as the default target string. 
<code>gensub</code> returns the new string as its result, which is
passed directly to <code>print</code> for printing.

     <!-- @cindex automatic warnings -->
<!-- @cindex warnings, automatic -->
<p>If the <var>how</var> argument is a string that does not begin with <span class="samp">g</span> or
<span class="samp">G</span>, or if it is a number that is less than or equal to zero, only one
substitution is performed.  If <var>how</var> is zero, <span class="command">gawk</span> issues
a warning message.

     <p>If <var>regexp</var> does not match <var>target</var>, <code>gensub</code>'s return value
is the original unchanged value of <var>target</var>.

     <p><code>gensub</code> is a <span class="command">gawk</span> extension; it is not available
in compatibility mode (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>).

     <br><dt><code>substr(</code><var>string</var><code>, </code><var>start</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code>, </code><var>length</var><span class="roman">]</span><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bsubstr_007d-function-1192"></a>This returns a <var>length</var>-character-long substring of <var>string</var>,
starting at character number <var>start</var>.  The first character of a
string is character number one.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-36" name="fnd-36"><sup>36</sup></a>
For example, <code>substr("washington", 5, 3)</code> returns <code>"ing"</code>.

     <p>If <var>length</var> is not present, this function returns the whole suffix of
<var>string</var> that begins at character number <var>start</var>.  For example,
<code>substr("washington", 5)</code> returns <code>"ington"</code>.  The whole
suffix is also returned
if <var>length</var> is greater than the number of characters remaining
in the string, counting from character <var>start</var>.

     <p>If <var>start</var> is less than one, <code>substr</code> treats it as
if it was one. (POSIX doesn't specify what to do in this case:
Unix <span class="command">awk</span> acts this way, and therefore <span class="command">gawk</span>
does too.) 
If <var>start</var> is greater than the number of characters
in the string, <code>substr</code> returns the null string. 
Similarly, if <var>length</var> is present but less than or equal to zero,
the null string is returned.

     <p><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-_0040code_007bsubstr_007d-function-1193"></a>The string returned by <code>substr</code> <em>cannot</em> be
assigned.  Thus, it is a mistake to attempt to change a portion of
a string, as shown in the following example:

     <pre class="example">          string = "abcdef"
          # try to get "abCDEf", won't work
          substr(string, 3, 3) = "CDE"
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">It is also a mistake to use <code>substr</code> as the third argument
of <code>sub</code> or <code>gsub</code>:

     <pre class="example">          gsub(/xyz/, "pdq", substr($0, 5, 20))  # WRONG
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-portability_002c-_0040code_007bsubstr_007d-function-1194"></a>(Some commercial versions of <span class="command">awk</span> do in fact let you use
<code>substr</code> this way, but doing so is not portable.)

     <p>If you need to replace bits and pieces of a string, combine <code>substr</code>
with string concatenation, in the following manner:

     <pre class="example">          string = "abcdef"
          ...
          string = substr(string, 1, 2) "CDE" substr(string, 6)
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-case-sensitivity_002c-converting-case-1195"></a><a name="index-converting_002c-case-1196"></a><br><dt><code>tolower(</code><var>string</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007btolower_007d-function-1197"></a>This returns a copy of <var>string</var>, with each uppercase character
in the string replaced with its corresponding lowercase character. 
Nonalphabetic characters are left unchanged.  For example,
<code>tolower("MiXeD cAsE 123")</code> returns <code>"mixed case 123"</code>.

     <br><dt><code>toupper(</code><var>string</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007btoupper_007d-function-1198"></a>This returns a copy of <var>string</var>, with each lowercase character

backslashes and ampersands into the replacement text, you need to remember
that there are several levels of <dfn>escape processing</dfn> going on.

   <p>First, there is the <dfn>lexical</dfn> level, which is when <span class="command">awk</span> reads
your program
and builds an internal copy of it that can be executed. 
Then there is the runtime level, which is when <span class="command">awk</span> actually scans the
replacement string to determine what to generate.

   <p>At both levels, <span class="command">awk</span> looks for a defined set of characters that
can come after a backslash.  At the lexical level, it looks for the
escape sequences listed in <a href="#Escape-Sequences">Escape Sequences</a>. 
Thus, for every <span class="samp">\</span> that <span class="command">awk</span> processes at the runtime
level, type two backslashes at the lexical level. 
When a character that is not valid for an escape sequence follows the
<span class="samp">\</span>, Unix <span class="command">awk</span> and <span class="command">gawk</span> both simply remove the initial
<span class="samp">\</span> and put the next character into the string. Thus, for
example, <code>"a\qb"</code> is treated as <code>"aqb"</code>.

   <p>At the runtime level, the various functions handle sequences of
<span class="samp">\</span> and <span class="samp">&amp;</span> differently.  The situation is (sadly) somewhat complex. 
Historically, the <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code> functions treated the two
character sequence <span class="samp">\&amp;</span> specially; this sequence was replaced in
the generated text with a single <span class="samp">&amp;</span>.  Any other <span class="samp">\</span> within
the <var>replacement</var> string that did not precede an <span class="samp">&amp;</span> was passed
through unchanged.  This is illustrated in <a href="#table_002dsub_002descapes">table-sub-escapes</a>.

<p class="noindent">This table shows both the lexical-level processing, where
an odd number of backslashes becomes an even number at the runtime level,
as well as the runtime processing done by <code>sub</code>. 
(For the sake of simplicity, the rest of the following tables only show the
case of even numbers of backslashes entered at the lexical level.)

   <p>The problem with the historical approach is that there is no way to get
a literal <span class="samp">\</span> followed by the matched text.

says that <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code> look for either a <span class="samp">\</span> or an <span class="samp">&amp;</span>
after the <span class="samp">\</span>. If either one follows a <span class="samp">\</span>, that character is

<p class="noindent">This appears to solve the problem. 
Unfortunately, the phrasing of the standard is unusual. It
says, in effect, that <span class="samp">\</span> turns off the special meaning of any
following character, but for anything other than <span class="samp">\</span> and <span class="samp">&amp;</span>,
such special meaning is undefined.  This wording leads to two problems:

     <ul>
<li>Backslashes must now be doubled in the <var>replacement</var> string, breaking
historical <span class="command">awk</span> programs.

     <li>To make sure that an <span class="command">awk</span> program is portable, <em>every</em> character
in the <var>replacement</var> string must be preceded with a
backslash.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-37" name="fnd-37"><sup>37</sup></a>
<!-- I can say that, 'cause I was involved in making this change -->
</ul>

   <p>Because of the problems just listed,
in 1996, the <span class="command">gawk</span> maintainer submitted
proposed text for a revised standard that
reverts to rules that correspond more closely to the original existing
practice. The proposed rules have special cases that make it possible
to produce a <span class="samp">\</span> preceding the matched text. This is shown in
<a href="#table_002dsub_002dproposed">table-sub-proposed</a>.

   <p><strong class="float-caption">Table 8.3: Proposed rules for sub and backslash</strong></p></div>

   <p>In a nutshell, at the runtime level, there are now three special sequences
of characters (<span class="samp">\\\&amp;</span>, <span class="samp">\\&amp;</span> and <span class="samp">\&amp;</span>) whereas historically
there was only one.  However, as in the historical case, any <span class="samp">\</span> that
is not part of one of these three sequences is not special and appears
in the output literally.

   <p><span class="command">gawk</span> 3.0 and 3.1 follow these proposed POSIX rules for <code>sub</code> and
<code>gsub</code>. 
<!-- As much as we think it's a lousy idea. You win some, you lose some. Sigh. -->
The POSIX standard took much longer to be revised than was expected in 1996. 
The 2001 standard does not follow the above rules.  Instead, the rules
there are somewhat simpler.  The results are similar except for one case.

   <p>The 2001 POSIX rules state that <span class="samp">\&amp;</span> in the replacement string produces
a literal <span class="samp">&amp;</span>, <span class="samp">\\</span> produces a literal <span class="samp">\</span>, and <span class="samp">\</span> followed
by anything else is not special; the <span class="samp">\</span> is placed straight into the output. 
These rules are presented in <a href="#table_002dposix_002d2001_002dsub">table-posix-2001-sub</a>.

   <div class="float">

</pre>
   <p><strong class="float-caption">Table 8.4: POSIX 2001 rules for sub</strong></p></div>

   <p>The only case where the difference is noticeable is the last one: <span class="samp">\\\\</span>
is seen as <span class="samp">\\</span> and produces <span class="samp">\</span> instead of <span class="samp">\\</span>.

   <p>Starting with version 3.1.4, <span class="command">gawk</span> follows the POSIX rules
when <span class="option">--posix</span> is specified (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>). Otherwise,
it continues to follow the 1996 proposed rules, since, as of this
writing, that has been its behavior for over seven years.

</blockquote>

   <p>The rules for <code>gensub</code> are considerably simpler. At the runtime
level, whenever <span class="command">gawk</span> sees a <span class="samp">\</span>, if the following character
is a digit, then the text that matched the corresponding parenthesized

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.4 Input/Output Functions</h4>

<p>The following functions relate to input/output (I/O). 
Optional parameters are enclosed in square brackets ([ ]):

     <dl>
<dt><code>close(</code><var>filename</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code>, </code><var>how</var><span class="roman">]</span><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bclose_007d-function-1213"></a><a name="index-files_002c-closing-1214"></a>Close the file <var>filename</var> for input or output. Alternatively, the
argument may be a shell command that was used for creating a coprocess, or
for redirecting to or from a pipe; then the coprocess or pipe is closed. 
See <a href="#Close-Files-And-Pipes">Close Files And Pipes</a>,
for more information.

     <p>When closing a coprocess, it is occasionally useful to first close
one end of the two-way pipe and then to close the other.  This is done
by providing a second argument to <code>close</code>.  This second argument
should be one of the two string values <code>"to"</code> or <code>"from"</code>,
indicating which end of the pipe to close.  Case in the string does
not matter. 
See <a href="#Two_002dway-I_002fO">Two-way I/O</a>,
which discusses this feature in more detail and gives an example.

to write to a disk file or terminal in memory until there is enough
for it to be worthwhile to send the data to the output device. 
This is often more efficient than writing
every little bit of information as soon as it is ready.  However, sometimes
it is necessary to force a program to <dfn>flush</dfn> its buffers; that is,
write the information to its destination, even if a buffer is not full. 
This is the purpose of the <code>fflush</code> function&mdash;<span class="command">gawk</span> also
buffers its output and the <code>fflush</code> function forces
<span class="command">gawk</span> to flush its buffers.

     <p><code>fflush</code> was added to the Bell Laboratories research
version of <span class="command">awk</span> in 1994; it is not part of the POSIX standard and is
not available if <span class="option">--posix</span> has been specified on the
command line (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>).

is to allow no argument at all. In this case, the buffer for the
standard output is flushed.  The second is to allow the null string
(<code>""</code><!-- /@w -->) as the argument. In this case, the buffers for
<em>all</em> open output files and pipes are flushed.

<!-- @cindex warnings, automatic -->
<p><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-_0040code_007bfflush_007d-function-1220"></a><code>fflush</code> returns zero if the buffer is successfully flushed;
otherwise, it returns &minus;1. 
In the case where all buffers are flushed, the return value is zero
only if all buffers were flushed successfully.  Otherwise, it is
&minus;1, and <span class="command">gawk</span> warns about the problem <var>filename</var>.

     <p><span class="command">gawk</span> also issues a warning message if you attempt to flush
a file or pipe that was opened for reading (such as with <code>getline</code>),
or if <var>filename</var> is not an open file, pipe, or coprocess. 
In such a case, <code>fflush</code> returns &minus;1, as well.

     <br><dt><code>system(</code><var>command</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bsystem_007d-function-1221"></a><a name="index-interacting-with-other-programs-1222"></a>Executes operating-system
commands and then returns to the <span class="command">awk</span> program.  The <code>system</code>
function executes the command given by the string <var>command</var>. 
It returns the status returned by the command that was executed as
its value.

     <p>For example, if the following fragment of code is put in your <span class="command">awk</span>
program:

     <pre class="example">          END {
               system("date | mail -s 'awk run done' root")
          }
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">the system administrator is sent mail when the <span class="command">awk</span> program
finishes processing input and begins its end-of-input processing.

     <p>Note that redirecting <code>print</code> or <code>printf</code> into a pipe is often
enough to accomplish your task.  If you need to run many commands, it
is more efficient to simply print them down a pipeline to the shell:

     <pre class="example">          while (<var>more stuff to do</var>)
              print <var>command</var> | "/bin/sh"
          close("/bin/sh")
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent"><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-_0040code_007bsystem_007d-function-1223"></a>However, if your <span class="command">awk</span>
program is interactive, <code>system</code> is useful for cranking up large
self-contained programs, such as a shell or an editor. 
Some operating systems cannot implement the <code>system</code> function. 
<code>system</code> causes a fatal error if it is not supported.

As a side point, buffering issues can be even more confusing, depending
upon whether your program is <dfn>interactive</dfn>, i.e., communicating
with a user sitting at a keyboard.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-38" name="fnd-38"><sup>38</sup></a>

<!-- Thanks to Walter.Mecky@dresdnerbank.de for this example, and for -->
<!-- motivating me to write this section. -->
<p>Interactive programs generally <dfn>line buffer</dfn> their output; i.e., they
write out every line.  Noninteractive programs wait until they have
a full buffer, which may be many lines of output. 
Here is an example of the difference:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ print $1 + $2 }'
     1 1
     -| 2
     2 3
     -| 5
     <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Each line of output is printed immediately. Compare that behavior
with this example:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ print $1 + $2 }' | cat
     1 1
     2 3
     <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd>
     -| 2
     -| 5
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, no output is printed until after the <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd> is typed, because
it is all buffered and sent down the pipe to <span class="command">cat</span> in one shot.

<h4 class="subheading">Advanced Notes: Controlling Output Buffering with <code>system</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-advanced-features_002c-buffering-1226"></a><a name="index-buffers_002c-flushing-1227"></a><a name="index-buffering_002c-input_002foutput-1228"></a><a name="index-output_002c-buffering-1229"></a>
The <code>fflush</code> function provides explicit control over output buffering for
individual files and pipes.  However, its use is not portable to many other
<span class="command">awk</span> implementations.  An alternative method to flush output
buffers is to call <code>system</code> with a null string as its argument:

<pre class="example">     system("")   # flush output
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><span class="command">gawk</span> treats this use of the <code>system</code> function as a special
case and is smart enough not to run a shell (or other command
interpreter) with the empty command.  Therefore, with <span class="command">gawk</span>, this
idiom is not only useful, it is also efficient.  While this method should work
with other <span class="command">awk</span> implementations, it does not necessarily avoid
starting an unnecessary shell.  (Other implementations may only
flush the buffer associated with the standard output and not necessarily
all buffered output.)

   <p>If you think about what a programmer expects, it makes sense that
<code>system</code> should flush any pending output.  The following program:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN {
          print "first print"
          system("echo system echo")
          print "second print"
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">must print:

<pre class="example">     first print
     system echo
     second print
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and not:

<pre class="example">     system echo
     first print
     second print
</pre>
   <p>If <span class="command">awk</span> did not flush its buffers before calling <code>system</code>,
you would see the latter (undesirable) output.

in the form returned by the <code>time</code> system call, which is the
number of seconds since a particular epoch.  On POSIX-compliant systems,
it is the number of seconds since

All known POSIX-compliant systems support timestamps from 0 through

The time is assumed to be in the local timezone. 
If the daylight-savings flag is positive, the time is assumed to be

   <p>The <code>systime</code> function allows you to compare a timestamp from a

   <p>The <code>strftime</code> function allows you to easily turn a timestamp

<!-- @cindex locale, definition of -->
<p>Informally, a <dfn>locale</dfn> is the geographic place in which a program
is meant to run.  For example, a common way to abbreviate the date
September 4, 1991 in the United States is &ldquo;9/4/91.&rdquo;
In many countries in Europe, however, it is abbreviated &ldquo;4.9.91.&rdquo;
Thus, the <span class="samp">%x</span> specification in a <code>"US"</code> locale might produce
<span class="samp">9/4/91</span>, while in a <code>"EUROPE"</code> locale, it might produce
<span class="samp">4.9.91</span>.  The ISO C standard defines a default <code>"C"</code>
locale, which is an environment that is typical of what most C programmers
are used to.

   <p>For systems that are not yet fully standards-compliant,
<span class="command">gawk</span> supplies a copy of
<code>strftime</code> from the GNU C Library. 
It supports all of the just listed format specifications. 
If that version is
used to compile <span class="command">gawk</span> (see <a href="#Installation">Installation</a>),
then the following additional format specifications are available:

     <dl>
<dt><code>%k</code><dd>The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (0&ndash;23). 
Single-digit numbers are padded with a space.

     <br><dt><code>%l</code><dd>The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (1&ndash;12). 
Single-digit numbers are padded with a space.

     <br><dt><code>%s</code><dd>The time as a decimal timestamp in seconds since the epoch.

   </dl>
   <!-- ENDOFRANGE strf -->

   <p>Additionally, the alternate representations are recognized but their
normal representations are used.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bdate_007d-utility_002c-POSIX-1245"></a><a name="index-POSIX-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-_0040code_007bdate_007d-utility-and-1246"></a>This example is an <span class="command">awk</span> implementation of the POSIX
<span class="command">date</span> utility.  Normally, the <span class="command">date</span> utility prints the
current date and time of day in a well-known format.  However, if you
provide an argument to it that begins with a <span class="samp">+</span>, <span class="command">date</span>
copies nonformat specifier characters to the standard output and
interprets the current time according to the format specifiers in
the string.  For example:

<pre class="example">     $ date '+Today is %A, %B %d, %Y.'
     -| Today is Thursday, September 14, 2000.
</pre>
   <p>Here is the <span class="command">gawk</span> version of the <span class="command">date</span> utility. 
It has a shell &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; to handle the <span class="option">-u</span> option,
which requires that <span class="command">date</span> run as if the time zone
is set to UTC:

<pre class="example">     #! /bin/sh

   <p>Many languages provide the ability to perform <dfn>bitwise</dfn> operations
on two integer numbers.  In other words, the operation is performed on
each successive pair of bits in the operands. 
Three common operations are bitwise AND, OR, and XOR. 
The operations are described in <a href="#table_002dbitwise_002dops">table-bitwise-ops</a>.

   <div class="float">
<a name="table_002dbitwise_002dops"></a>
<pre class="display">                     Bit Operator

</pre>
   <p><strong class="float-caption">Table 8.6: Bitwise Operations</strong></p></div>

   <p><a name="index-bitwise_002c-complement-1252"></a><a name="index-complement_002c-bitwise-1253"></a>As you can see, the result of an AND operation is 1 only when <em>both</em>
bits are 1. 
The result of an OR operation is 1 if <em>either</em> bit is 1. 
The result of an XOR operation is 1 if either bit is 1,
but not both. 
The next operation is the <dfn>complement</dfn>; the complement of 1 is 0 and
the complement of 0 is 1. Thus, this operation &ldquo;flips&rdquo; all the bits
of a given value.

   <p><a name="index-bitwise_002c-shift-1254"></a><a name="index-left-shift_002c-bitwise-1255"></a><a name="index-right-shift_002c-bitwise-1256"></a><a name="index-shift_002c-bitwise-1257"></a>Finally, two other common operations are to shift the bits left or right. 
For example, if you have a bit string <span class="samp">10111001</span> and you shift it
right by three bits, you end up with <span class="samp">00010111</span>.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-45" name="fnd-45"><sup>45</sup></a>
<!-- Purposely decided to use   0's   and   1's   here.  2/2001. -->
If you start over
again with <span class="samp">10111001</span> and shift it left by three bits, you end up
with <span class="samp">11001000</span>. 
<span class="command">gawk</span> provides built-in functions that implement the
bitwise operations just described. They are:

   <p>For all of these functions, first the double-precision floating-point value is
converted to the widest C unsigned integer type, then the bitwise operation is
performed.  If the result cannot be represented exactly as a C <code>double</code>,
leading nonzero bits are removed one by one until it can be represented
exactly.  The result is then converted back into a C <code>double</code>.  (If
you don't understand this paragraph, don't worry about it.)

   <p>Here is a user-defined function
(see <a href="#User_002ddefined">User-defined</a>)

The number <code>1</code> represents a binary value where the rightmost bit
is set to 1.  Using this mask,
the function repeatedly checks the rightmost bit. 
ANDing the mask with the value indicates whether the
rightmost bit is 1 or not. If so, a <code>"1"</code> is concatenated onto the front
of the string. 
Otherwise, a <code>"0"</code> is added. 
The value is then shifted right by one bit and the loop continues
until there are no more 1 bits.

   <p>If the initial value is zero it returns a simple <code>"0"</code>. 
Otherwise, at the end, it pads the value with zeros to represent multiples
of 8-bit quantities. This is typical in modern computers.

   <p>The main code in the <code>BEGIN</code> rule shows the difference between the
decimal and octal values for the same numbers
(see <a href="#Nondecimal_002dnumbers">Nondecimal-numbers</a>),
and then demonstrates the
results of the <code>compl</code>, <code>lshift</code>, and <code>rshift</code> functions.

<h4 class="subsection">8.2.1 Function Definition Syntax</h4>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE fdef -->
<p><a name="index-functions_002c-defining-1279"></a>Definitions of functions can appear anywhere between the rules of an
<span class="command">awk</span> program.  Thus, the general form of an <span class="command">awk</span> program is
extended to include sequences of rules <em>and</em> user-defined function
definitions. 
There is no need to put the definition of a function
before all uses of the function.  This is because <span class="command">awk</span> reads the
entire program before starting to execute any of it.

   <p>The definition of a function named <var>name</var> looks like this:
<!-- NEXT ED: put [ ] around parameter list -->

<pre class="example">     function <var>name</var>(<var>parameter-list</var>)
     {
          <var>body-of-function</var>
     }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-names_002c-functions-1280"></a><a name="index-functions_002c-names-of-1281"></a><a name="index-namespace-issues_002c-functions-1282"></a><var>name</var> is the name of the function to define.  A valid function
name is like a valid variable name: a sequence of letters, digits, and
underscores that doesn't start with a digit. 
Within a single <span class="command">awk</span> program, any particular name can only be
used as a variable, array, or function.

<!-- NEXT ED: parameter-list is an OPTIONAL list of ... -->
<p><var>parameter-list</var> is a list of the function's arguments and local
variable names, separated by commas.  When the function is called,
the argument names are used to hold the argument values given in
the call.  The local variables are initialized to the empty string. 
A function cannot have two parameters with the same name, nor may it
have a parameter with the same name as the function itself.

   <p>The <var>body-of-function</var> consists of <span class="command">awk</span> statements.  It is the
most important part of the definition, because it says what the function
should actually <em>do</em>.  The argument names exist to give the body a
way to talk about the arguments; local variables exist to give the body
places to keep temporary values.

   <p>Argument names are not distinguished syntactically from local variable
names. Instead, the number of arguments supplied when the function is
called determines how many argument variables there are.  Thus, if three
argument values are given, the first three names in <var>parameter-list</var>
are arguments and the rest are local variables.

   <p>It follows that if the number of arguments is not the same in all calls
to the function, some of the names in <var>parameter-list</var> may be
arguments on some occasions and local variables on others.  Another
way to think of this is that omitted arguments default to the
null string.

   <p><a name="index-programming-conventions_002c-functions_002c-writing-1283"></a>Usually when you write a function, you know how many names you intend to
use for arguments and how many you intend to use as local variables.  It is
conventional to place some extra space between the arguments and
the local variables, in order to document how your function is supposed to be used.

   <p><a name="index-variables_002c-shadowing-1284"></a>During execution of the function body, the arguments and local variable
values hide, or <dfn>shadow</dfn>, any variables of the same names used in the
rest of the program.  The shadowed variables are not accessible in the
function definition, because there is no way to name them while their
names have been taken away for the local variables.  All other variables
used in the <span class="command">awk</span> program can be referenced or set normally in the
function's body.

   <p>The arguments and local variables last only as long as the function body
is executing.  Once the body finishes, you can once again access the
variables that were shadowed while the function was running.

   <p><a name="index-recursive-functions-1285"></a><a name="index-functions_002c-recursive-1286"></a>The function body can contain expressions that call functions.  They
can even call this function, either directly or by way of another
function.  When this happens, we say the function is <dfn>recursive</dfn>. 
The act of a function calling itself is called <dfn>recursion</dfn>.

the keyword <code>function</code> may be
abbreviated <code>func</code>.  However, POSIX only specifies the use of
the keyword <code>function</code>.  This actually has some practical implications. 
If <span class="command">gawk</span> is in POSIX-compatibility mode
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>), then the following
statement does <em>not</em> define a function:

<pre class="example">     func foo() { a = sqrt($1) ; print a }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Instead it defines a rule that, for each record, concatenates the value
of the variable <span class="samp">func</span> with the return value of the function <span class="samp">foo</span>. 
If the resulting string is non-null, the action is executed. 
This is probably not what is desired.  (<span class="command">awk</span> accepts this input as
syntactically valid, because functions may be used before they are defined
in <span class="command">awk</span> programs.)

<h4 class="subsection">8.2.2 Function Definition Examples</h4>

<p>Here is an example of a user-defined function, called <code>myprint</code>, that
takes a number and prints it in a specific format:

<pre class="example">     function myprint(num)
     {
          printf "%6.3g\n", num
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To illustrate, here is an <span class="command">awk</span> rule that uses our <code>myprint</code>
function:

<pre class="example">     $3 &gt; 0     { myprint($3) }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This program prints, in our special format, all the third fields that
contain a positive number in our input.  Therefore, when given the following:

<pre class="example">      1.2   3.4    5.6   7.8
      9.10 11.12 -13.14 15.16
     17.18 19.20  21.22 23.24
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">this program, using our function to format the results, prints:

<pre class="example">        5.6
       21.2
</pre>
   <p>This function deletes all the elements in an array:

<pre class="example">     function delarray(a,    i)
     {
         for (i in a)
            delete a[i]
     }
</pre>
   <p>When working with arrays, it is often necessary to delete all the elements
in an array and start over with a new list of elements
(see <a href="#Delete">Delete</a>). 
Instead of having
to repeat this loop everywhere that you need to clear out
an array, your program can just call <code>delarray</code>. 
(This guarantees portability.  The use of <span class="samp">delete </span><var>array</var> to delete
the contents of an entire array is a nonstandard extension.)

   <p>The following is an example of a recursive function.  It takes a string
as an input parameter and returns the string in backwards order. 
Recursive functions must always have a test that stops the recursion. 
In this case, the recursion terminates when the starting position
is zero, i.e., when there are no more characters left in the string.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007brev_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1289"></a>
<pre class="example">     function rev(str, start)
     {
         if (start == 0)
             return ""
     
         return (substr(str, start, 1) rev(str, start - 1))
     }
</pre>
   <p>If this function is in a file named <span class="file">rev.awk</span>, it can be tested
this way:

<pre class="example">     $ echo "Don't Panic!" |
     &gt; gawk --source '{ print rev($0, length($0)) }' -f rev.awk
     -| !cinaP t'noD
</pre>
   <p>The C <code>ctime</code> function takes a timestamp and returns it in a string,
formatted in a well-known fashion. 
The following example uses the built-in <code>strftime</code> function
(see <a href="#Time-Functions">Time Functions</a>)
to create an <span class="command">awk</span> version of <code>ctime</code>:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bctime_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1290"></a><!-- FIXME: One day, change %d to %e, when C 99 is common. -->

     {
         format = "%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y"
         if (ts == 0)
             ts = systime()       # use current time as default
         return strftime(format, ts)

<h4 class="subsection">8.2.3 Calling User-Defined Functions</h4>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE fudc -->
<p><a name="index-functions_002c-user_002ddefined_002c-calling-1291"></a><dfn>Calling a function</dfn> means causing the function to run and do its job. 
A function call is an expression and its value is the value returned by
the function.

   <p>A function call consists of the function name followed by the arguments
in parentheses.  <span class="command">awk</span> expressions are what you write in the
call for the arguments.  Each time the call is executed, these
expressions are evaluated, and the values are the actual arguments.  For
example, here is a call to <code>foo</code> with three arguments (the first
being a string concatenation):

<pre class="example">     foo(x y, "lose", 4 * z)
</pre>
   <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) are not allowed
between the function name and the open-parenthesis of the argument list. 
If you write whitespace by mistake, <span class="command">awk</span> might think that you mean
to concatenate a variable with an expression in parentheses.  However, it
notices that you used a function name and not a variable name, and reports
an error.

   <p><a name="index-call-by-value-1292"></a>When a function is called, it is given a <em>copy</em> of the values of
its arguments.  This is known as <dfn>call by value</dfn>.  The caller may use
a variable as the expression for the argument, but the called function
does not know this&mdash;it only knows what value the argument had.  For
example, if you write the following code:

<pre class="example">     foo = "bar"
     z = myfunc(foo)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then you should not think of the argument to <code>myfunc</code> as being
&ldquo;the variable <code>foo</code>.&rdquo;  Instead, think of the argument as the
string value <code>"bar"</code>. 
If the function <code>myfunc</code> alters the values of its local variables,
this has no effect on any other variables.  Thus, if <code>myfunc</code>
does this:

<pre class="example">     function myfunc(str)
     {
       print str
       str = "zzz"
       print str
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to change its first argument variable <code>str</code>, it does <em>not</em>
change the value of <code>foo</code> in the caller.  The role of <code>foo</code> in
calling <code>myfunc</code> ended when its value (<code>"bar"</code>) was computed. 
If <code>str</code> also exists outside of <code>myfunc</code>, the function body
cannot alter this outer value, because it is shadowed during the
execution of <code>myfunc</code> and cannot be seen or changed from there.

   <p><a name="index-call-by-reference-1293"></a><a name="index-arrays_002c-as-parameters-to-functions-1294"></a><a name="index-functions_002c-arrays-as-parameters-to-1295"></a>However, when arrays are the parameters to functions, they are <em>not</em>
copied.  Instead, the array itself is made available for direct manipulation
by the function.  This is usually called <dfn>call by reference</dfn>. 
Changes made to an array parameter inside the body of a function <em>are</em>
visible outside that function.

   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> Changing an array parameter inside a function
can be very dangerous if you do not watch what you are doing. 
For example:

     <pre class="example">          function changeit(array, ind, nvalue)
          {
               array[ind] = nvalue
          }
          
          BEGIN {
              a[1] = 1; a[2] = 2; a[3] = 3
              changeit(a, 2, "two")
              printf "a[1] = %s, a[2] = %s, a[3] = %s\n",
                      a[1], a[2], a[3]
          }
     </pre>
        <p class="noindent">prints <span class="samp">a[1] = 1, a[2] = two, a[3] = 3</span>, because
<code>changeit</code> stores <code>"two"</code> in the second element of <code>a</code>. 
</blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-undefined-functions-1296"></a><a name="index-functions_002c-undefined-1297"></a>Some <span class="command">awk</span> implementations allow you to call a function that
has not been defined. They only report a problem at runtime when the
program actually tries to call the function. For example:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN {
         if (0)
             foo()
         else
             bar()
     }
     function bar() { ... }
     # note that `foo' is not defined
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Because the <span class="samp">if</span> statement will never be true, it is not really a
problem that <code>foo</code> has not been defined.  Usually, though, it is a
problem if a program calls an undefined function.

   <p><a name="index-lint-checking_002c-undefined-functions-1298"></a>If <span class="option">--lint</span> is specified
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>),
<span class="command">gawk</span> reports calls to undefined functions.

error if you use the <code>next</code> statement

<h4 class="subsection">8.2.4 The <code>return</code> Statement</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007breturn_007d-statement_0040comma_007b_007d-user_002ddefined-functions-1300"></a>
The body of a user-defined function can contain a <code>return</code> statement. 
This statement returns control to the calling part of the <span class="command">awk</span> program.  It
can also be used to return a value for use in the rest of the <span class="command">awk</span>
program.  It looks like this:

<pre class="example">     return <span class="roman">[</span><var>expression</var><span class="roman">]</span>
</pre>
   <p>The <var>expression</var> part is optional.  If it is omitted, then the returned
value is undefined, and therefore, unpredictable.

   <p>A <code>return</code> statement with no value expression is assumed at the end of
every function definition.  So if control reaches the end of the function
body, then the function returns an unpredictable value.  <span class="command">awk</span>
does <em>not</em> warn you if you use the return value of such a function.

   <p>Sometimes, you want to write a function for what it does, not for
what it returns.  Such a function corresponds to a <code>void</code> function
in C or to a <code>procedure</code> in Pascal.  Thus, it may be appropriate to not
return any value; simply bear in mind that if you use the return
value of such a function, you do so at your own risk.

   <p>The following is an example of a user-defined function that returns a value
for the largest number among the elements of an array:

<pre class="example">     function maxelt(vec,   i, ret)
     {
          for (i in vec) {
               if (ret == "" || vec[i] &gt; ret)
                    ret = vec[i]
          }
          return ret
     }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-programming-conventions_002c-function-parameters-1301"></a>You call <code>maxelt</code> with one argument, which is an array name.  The local
variables <code>i</code> and <code>ret</code> are not intended to be arguments;
while there is nothing to stop you from passing more than one argument
to <code>maxelt</code>, the results would be strange.  The extra space before
<code>i</code> in the function parameter list indicates that <code>i</code> and
<code>ret</code> are not supposed to be arguments. 
You should follow this convention when defining functions.

   <p>The following program uses the <code>maxelt</code> function.  It loads an
array, calls <code>maxelt</code>, and then reports the maximum number in that
array:

<pre class="example">     function maxelt(vec,   i, ret)
     {
          for (i in vec) {
               if (ret == "" || vec[i] &gt; ret)
                    ret = vec[i]
          }
          return ret
     }
     
     # Load all fields of each record into nums.
     {
          for(i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i++)
               nums[NR, i] = $i
     }
     
     END {
          print maxelt(nums)
     }
</pre>
   <p>Given the following input:

<pre class="example">      1 5 23 8 16
     44 3 5 2 8 26
     256 291 1396 2962 100
     -6 467 998 1101
     99385 11 0 225
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the program reports (predictably) that <code>99385</code> is the largest number
in the array.

<h4 class="subsection">8.2.5 Functions and Their Effects on Variable Typing</h4>

<p><span class="command">awk</span> is a very fluid language. 
It is possible that <span class="command">awk</span> can't tell if an identifier
represents a regular variable or an array until runtime. 
Here is an annotated sample program:

<pre class="example">     function foo(a)
     {
         a[1] = 1   # parameter is an array
     }
     
     BEGIN {
         b = 1
         foo(b)  # invalid: fatal type mismatch
     
         foo(x)  # x uninitialized, becomes an array dynamically
         x = 1   # now not allowed, runtime error
     }

<h2 class="chapter">9 Internationalization with <span class="command">gawk</span></h2>

<p>Once upon a time, computer makers
wrote software that worked only in English. 
Eventually, hardware and software vendors noticed that if their
systems worked in the native languages of non-English-speaking
countries, they were able to sell more systems. 
As a result, internationalization and localization
of programs and software systems became a common practice.

uses for internationalization, as well as how
<span class="command">gawk</span> makes internationalization
features available at the <span class="command">awk</span> program level. 
Having internationalization available at the <span class="command">awk</span> level
gives software developers additional flexibility&mdash;they are no
longer required to write in C when internationalization is
a requirement.

<a name="index-_0040code_007bgettext_007d-library-1309"></a>The facilities in GNU <code>gettext</code> focus on messages; strings printed
by a program, either directly or via formatting with <code>printf</code> or
<code>sprintf</code>.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-46" name="fnd-46"><sup>46</sup></a>

   <p><a name="index-portability_002c-_0040code_007bgettext_007d-library-and-1310"></a>When using GNU <code>gettext</code>, each application has its own
<dfn>text domain</dfn>.  This is a unique name, such as <span class="samp">kpilot</span> or <span class="samp">gawk</span>,
that identifies the application. 
A complete application may have multiple components&mdash;programs written
in C or C++, as well as scripts written in <span class="command">sh</span> or <span class="command">awk</span>. 
All of the components use the same text domain.

   <p>To make the discussion concrete, assume we're writing an application
named <span class="command">guide</span>.  Internationalization consists of the
following steps, in this order:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The programmer goes
through the source for all of <span class="command">guide</span>'s components
and marks each string that is a candidate for translation. 
For example, <code>"`-F': option required"</code> is a good candidate for translation. 
A table with strings of option names is not (e.g., <span class="command">gawk</span>'s
<span class="option">--profile</span> option should remain the same, no matter what the local
language).

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007btextdomain_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1311"></a><li>The programmer indicates the application's text domain
(<code>"guide"</code>) to the <code>gettext</code> library,
by calling the <code>textdomain</code> function.

     <li>Messages from the application are extracted from the source code and
collected into a portable object file (<span class="file">guide.po</span>),
which lists the strings and their translations. 
The translations are initially empty. 
The original (usually English) messages serve as the key for
lookup of the translations.

is copied and translations are created and shipped with the application.

A message object file contains the original messages and their

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgettext_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1325"></a>In C (or C++), the string marking and dynamic translation lookup
are accomplished by wrapping each string in a call to <code>gettext</code>:

<pre class="example">     printf(gettext("Don't Panic!\n"));
</pre>
   <p>The tools that extract messages from source code pull out all
strings enclosed in calls to <code>gettext</code>.

<span class="samp">gettext</span> over and over again is both painful and ugly to look
at, use the macro <span class="samp">_</span> (an underscore) to make things easier:

<pre class="example">     /* In the standard header file: */
     #define _(str) gettext(str)
     
     /* In the program text: */
     printf(_("Don't Panic!\n"));

and is considerably easier to read as well. 
There are locale <dfn>categories</dfn>
for different types of locale-related information.

<!-- STARTOFRANGE inap -->
<p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-internationalizing-1344"></a>
<span class="command">gawk</span> provides the following variables and functions for
internationalization:

     
<a name="index-_0040code_007bTEXTDOMAIN_007d-variable-1345"></a>
<dl><dt><code>TEXTDOMAIN</code><dd>This variable indicates the application's text domain. 
For compatibility with GNU <code>gettext</code>, the default
value is <code>"messages"</code>.

are candidates for translation at runtime. 
String constants without a leading underscore are not translated.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bdcgettext_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029-1348"></a><br><dt><code>dcgettext(</code><var>string</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code>, </code><var>domain</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code>, </code><var>category</var><span class="roman">]]</span><code>)</code><dd>This built-in function returns the translation of <var>string</var> in
text domain <var>domain</var> for locale category <var>category</var>. 
The default value for <var>domain</var> is the current value of <code>TEXTDOMAIN</code>. 
The default value for <var>category</var> is <code>"LC_MESSAGES"</code>.

     <p>If you supply a value for <var>category</var>, it must be a string equal to
one of the known locale categories described in
the previous section. 
You must also supply a text domain.  Use <code>TEXTDOMAIN</code> if
you want to use the current domain.

     <p><strong>Caution:</strong> The order of arguments to the <span class="command">awk</span> version
of the <code>dcgettext</code> function is purposely different from the order for
the C version.  The <span class="command">awk</span> version's order was
chosen to be simple and to allow for reasonable <span class="command">awk</span>-style
default arguments.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bdcngettext_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029-1349"></a><br><dt><code>dcngettext(</code><var>string1</var><code>, </code><var>string2</var><code>, </code><var>number</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code>, </code><var>domain</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code>, </code><var>category</var><span class="roman">]]</span><code>)</code><dd>This built-in function returns the plural form used for <var>number</var> of the
translation of <var>string1</var> and <var>string2</var> in text domain
<var>domain</var> for locale category <var>category</var>. <var>string1</var> is the
English singular variant of a message, and <var>string2</var> the English plural
variant of the same message. 
The default value for <var>domain</var> is the current value of <code>TEXTDOMAIN</code>. 
The default value for <var>category</var> is <code>"LC_MESSAGES"</code>.

     <p>The same remarks as for the <code>dcgettext</code> function apply.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002emo_007d-files_002c-specifying-directory-of-1350"></a><a name="index-files_002c-_0040code_007b_002emo_007d_002c-specifying-directory-of-1351"></a><a name="index-message-object-files_002c-specifying-directory-of-1352"></a><a name="index-files_002c-message-object_002c-specifying-directory-of-1353"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bbindtextdomain_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029-1354"></a><br><dt><code>bindtextdomain(</code><var>directory</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code>, </code><var>domain</var><span class="roman">]</span><code>)</code><dd>This built-in function allows you to specify the directory in which
<code>gettext</code> looks for <span class="file">.mo</span> files, in case they
will not or cannot be placed in the standard locations
(e.g., during testing). 
It returns the directory in which <var>domain</var> is &ldquo;bound.&rdquo;

     <p>The default <var>domain</var> is the value of <code>TEXTDOMAIN</code>. 
If <var>directory</var> is the null string (<code>""</code>), then
<code>bindtextdomain</code> returns the current binding for the
given <var>domain</var>. 
</dl>

   <p>To use these facilities in your <span class="command">awk</span> program, follow the steps
outlined in
the previous section,
like so:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<a name="index-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern_002c-_0040code_007bTEXTDOMAIN_007d-variable-and-1355"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bTEXTDOMAIN_007d-variable_002c-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern-and-1356"></a><li>Set the variable <code>TEXTDOMAIN</code> to the text domain of
your program.  This is best done in a <code>BEGIN</code> rule
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>),
or it can also be done via the <span class="option">-v</span> command-line
option (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>):

     <pre class="example">          BEGIN {
              TEXTDOMAIN = "guide"
              ...
          }
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005f_007d-_0028underscore_0029_002c-translatable-string-1357"></a><a name="index-underscore-_0028_0040code_007b_005f_007d_0029_002c-translatable-string-1358"></a><li>Mark all translatable strings with a leading underscore (<span class="samp">_</span>)
character.  It <em>must</em> be adjacent to the opening
quote of the string.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          print _"hello, world"
          x = _"you goofed"
          printf(_"Number of users is %d\n", nusers)
     </pre>
     <li>If you are creating strings dynamically, you can
still translate them, using the <code>dcgettext</code>
built-in function:

     <pre class="example">          message = nusers " users logged in"
          message = dcgettext(message, "adminprog")
          print message
     </pre>
     <p>Here, the call to <code>dcgettext</code> supplies a different
text domain (<code>"adminprog"</code>) in which to find the
message, but it uses the default <code>"LC_MESSAGES"</code> category.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bLC_005fMESSAGES_007d-locale-category_002c-_0040code_007bbindtextdomain_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029-1359"></a><li>During development, you might want to put the <span class="file">.mo</span>
file in a private directory for testing.  This is done
with the <code>bindtextdomain</code> built-in function:

     <pre class="example">          BEGIN {
             TEXTDOMAIN = "guide"   # our text domain
             if (Testing) {
                 # where to find our files
                 bindtextdomain("testdir")
                 # joe is in charge of adminprog
                 bindtextdomain("../joe/testdir", "adminprog")
             }
             ...
          }
     </pre>
        </ol>

<a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dgen_002dpo_007d-option-1371"></a>Once your <span class="command">awk</span> program is working, and all the strings have

<h4 class="subsection">9.4.2 Rearranging <code>printf</code> Arguments</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bprintf_007d-statement_002c-positional-specifiers-1373"></a><a name="index-positional-specifiers_0040comma_007b_007d-_0040code_007bprintf_007d-statement-1374"></a>Format strings for <code>printf</code> and <code>sprintf</code>
(see <a href="#Printf">Printf</a>)
present a special problem for translation. 
Consider the following:<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-49" name="fnd-49"><sup>49</sup></a>

<!-- line broken here only for smallbook format -->
<pre class="example">     printf(_"String `%s' has %d characters\n",
               string, length(string)))
</pre>
   <p>A possible German translation for this might be:

<pre class="example">     "%d Zeichen lang ist die Zeichenkette `%s'\n"
</pre>
   <p>The problem should be obvious: the order of the format
specifications is different from the original! 
Even though <code>gettext</code> can return the translated string
at runtime,
it cannot change the argument order in the call to <code>printf</code>.

   <p>To solve this problem, <code>printf</code> format specifiers may have
an additional optional element, which we call a <dfn>positional specifier</dfn>. 
For example:

<pre class="example">     "%2$d Zeichen lang ist die Zeichenkette `%1$s'\n"
</pre>
   <p>Here, the positional specifier consists of an integer count, which indicates which
argument to use, and a <span class="samp">$</span>. Counts are one-based, and the
format string itself is <em>not</em> included.  Thus, in the following
example, <span class="samp">string</span> is the first argument and <span class="samp">length(string)</span> is the second:

<pre class="example">     $ gawk 'BEGIN {
     &gt;     string = "Dont Panic"
     &gt;     printf _"%2$d characters live in \"%1$s\"\n",
     &gt;                         string, length(string)
     &gt; }'
     -| 10 characters live in "Dont Panic"
</pre>
   <p>If present, positional specifiers come first in the format specification,
before the flags, the field width, and/or the precision.

   <p>Positional specifiers can be used with the dynamic field width and
precision capability:

<pre class="example">     $ gawk 'BEGIN {
     &gt;    printf("%*.*s\n", 10, 20, "hello")
     &gt;    printf("%3$*2$.*1$s\n", 20, 10, "hello")
     &gt; }'
     -|      hello
     -|      hello
</pre>
   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> When using <span class="samp">*</span> with a positional specifier, the <span class="samp">*</span>
comes first, then the integer position, and then the <span class="samp">$</span>. 
This is somewhat counterintuitive. 
</blockquote>

and those with positional specifiers in the same string:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gawk 'BEGIN { printf _"%d %3$s\n", 1, 2, "hi" }'
     error--&gt; gawk: cmd. line:1: fatal: must use `count$' on all formats or none

   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> There are some pathological cases that <span class="command">gawk</span> may fail to
diagnose.  In such cases, the output may not be what you expect. 
It's still a bad idea to try mixing them, even if <span class="command">gawk</span>
doesn't detect it. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Although positional specifiers can be used directly in <span class="command">awk</span> programs,
their primary purpose is to help in producing correct translations of
format strings into languages different from the one in which the program

as the concatenation of a variable named <code>_</code> with the string
following it.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-50" name="fnd-50"><sup>50</sup></a> Typically, the variable <code>_</code> has
the null string (<code>""</code>) as its value, leaving the original string constant as
the result.

     <li>By defining &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; functions to replace <code>dcgettext</code>, <code>dcngettext</code>
and <code>bindtextdomain</code>, the <span class="command">awk</span> program can be made to run, but
all the messages are output in the original language. 
For example:

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bbindtextdomain_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029_002c-portability-and-1381"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bdcgettext_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029_002c-portability-and-1382"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bdcngettext_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029_002c-portability-and-1383"></a>
     <pre class="example">          <!-- file eg/lib/libintl.awk -->
          function bindtextdomain(dir, domain)
          {
              return dir
          }
          
          function dcgettext(string, domain, category)
          {
              return string
          }
          
          function dcngettext(string1, string2, number, domain, category)
          {
              return (number == 1 ? string1 : string2)
          }
          <!-- endfile -->
     </pre>
     <li>The use of positional specifications in <code>printf</code> or
<code>sprintf</code> is <em>not</em> portable. 
To support <code>gettext</code> at the C level, many systems' C versions of
<code>sprintf</code> do support positional specifiers.  But it works only if
enough arguments are supplied in the function call.  Many versions of
<span class="command">awk</span> pass <code>printf</code> formats and arguments unchanged to the
underlying C library version of <code>sprintf</code>, but only one format and
argument at a time.  What happens if a positional specification is
used is anybody's guess. 
However, since the positional specifications are primarily for use in
<em>translated</em> format strings, and since non-GNU <span class="command">awk</span>s never
retrieve the translated string, this should not be a problem in practice.

<h3 class="section">9.5 A Simple Internationalization Example</h3>

<p>Now let's look at a step-by-step example of how to internationalize and
localize a simple <span class="command">awk</span> program, using <span class="file">guide.awk</span> as our
original source:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/guide.awk -->
     BEGIN {
         TEXTDOMAIN = "guide"
         bindtextdomain(".")  # for testing
         print _"Don't Panic"
         print _"The Answer Is", 42
         print "Pardon me, Zaphod who?"
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Run <span class="samp">gawk --gen-po</span> to create the <span class="file">.po</span> file:

<pre class="example">     $ gawk --gen-po -f guide.awk &gt; guide.po
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This produces:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/data/guide.po -->
     #: guide.awk:4
     msgid "Don't Panic"
     msgstr ""
     
     #: guide.awk:5
     msgid "The Answer Is"
     msgstr ""
     
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>This original portable object file is saved and reused for each language
into which the application is translated.  The <code>msgid</code>
is the original string and the <code>msgstr</code> is the translation.

   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> Strings not marked with a leading underscore do not
appear in the <span class="file">guide.po</span> file. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Next, the messages must be translated. 
Here is a translation to a hypothetical dialect of English,
called &ldquo;Mellow&rdquo;:<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-51" name="fnd-51"><sup>51</sup></a>

<pre class="example">     $ cp guide.po guide-mellow.po
     <var>Add translations to</var> guide-mellow.po ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Following are the translations:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/data/guide-mellow.po -->
     #: guide.awk:4
     msgid "Don't Panic"
     msgstr "Hey man, relax!"
     
     #: guide.awk:5
     msgid "The Answer Is"
     msgstr "Like, the scoop is"
     
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Linux-1384"></a><a name="index-GNU_002fLinux-1385"></a>The next step is to make the directory to hold the binary message object
file and then to create the <span class="file">guide.mo</span> file. 
The directory layout shown here is standard for GNU <code>gettext</code> on
GNU/Linux systems.  Other versions of <code>gettext</code> may use a different
layout:

<pre class="example">     $ mkdir en_US en_US/LC_MESSAGES
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002epo_007d-files_002c-converting-to-_0040code_007b_002emo_007d-1386"></a><a name="index-files_002c-_0040code_007b_002epo_007d_002c-converting-to-_0040code_007b_002emo_007d-1387"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002emo_007d-files_002c-converting-from-_0040code_007b_002epo_007d-1388"></a><a name="index-files_002c-_0040code_007b_002emo_007d_002c-converting-from-_0040code_007b_002epo_007d-1389"></a><a name="index-portable-object-files_002c-converting-to-message-object-files-1390"></a><a name="index-files_002c-portable-object_002c-converting-to-message-object-files-1391"></a><a name="index-message-object-files_002c-converting-from-portable-object-files-1392"></a><a name="index-files_002c-message-object_002c-converting-from-portable-object-files-1393"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bmsgfmt_007d-utility-1394"></a>The <span class="command">msgfmt</span> utility does the conversion from human-readable
<span class="file">.po</span> file to machine-readable <span class="file">.mo</span> file. 
By default, <span class="command">msgfmt</span> creates a file named <span class="file">messages</span>. 
This file must be renamed and placed in the proper directory so that
<span class="command">gawk</span> can find it:

<pre class="example">     $ msgfmt guide-mellow.po
     $ mv messages en_US/LC_MESSAGES/guide.mo
</pre>
   <p>Finally, we run the program to test it:

<pre class="example">     $ gawk -f guide.awk
     -| Hey man, relax!
     -| Like, the scoop is 42
     -| Pardon me, Zaphod who?
</pre>
   <p>If the three replacement functions for <code>dcgettext</code>, <code>dcngettext</code>
and <code>bindtextdomain</code>
(see <a href="#I18N-Portability">I18N Portability</a>)
are in a file named <span class="file">libintl.awk</span>,
then we can run <span class="file">guide.awk</span> unchanged as follows:

<pre class="example">     $ gawk --posix -f guide.awk -f libintl.awk
     -| Don't Panic
     -| The Answer Is 42
     -| Pardon me, Zaphod who?

<i>Write documentation as if whoever reads it is
a violent psychopath who knows where you live.</i><br>
Steve English, as quoted by Peter Langston
</blockquote>

   <p>This chapter discusses advanced features in <span class="command">gawk</span>. 
It's a bit of a &ldquo;grab bag&rdquo; of items that are otherwise unrelated
to each other. 
First, a command-line option allows <span class="command">gawk</span> to recognize
nondecimal numbers in input data, not just in <span class="command">awk</span>
programs.  Next, two-way I/O, discussed briefly in earlier parts of this
Web page, is described in full detail, along with the basics
of TCP/IP networking and BSD portal files.  Finally, <span class="command">gawk</span>
can <dfn>profile</dfn> an <span class="command">awk</span> program, making it possible to tune
it for performance.

   <p><a href="#Dynamic-Extensions">Dynamic Extensions</a>,
discusses the ability to dynamically add new built-in functions to
<span class="command">gawk</span>.  As this feature is still immature and likely to change,
its description is relegated to an appendix.

<h3 class="section">10.1 Allowing Nondecimal Input Data</h3>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dnon_002ddecimal_002ddata_007d-option-1398"></a><a name="index-advanced-features_002c-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-nondecimal-input-data-1399"></a><a name="index-input_002c-data_0040comma_007b_007d-nondecimal-1400"></a><a name="index-constants_002c-nondecimal-1401"></a>
If you run <span class="command">gawk</span> with the <span class="option">--non-decimal-data</span> option,
you can have nondecimal constants in your input data:

<!-- line break here for small book format -->
<pre class="example">     $ echo 0123 123 0x123 |
     &gt; gawk --non-decimal-data '{ printf "%d, %d, %d\n",
     &gt;                                         $1, $2, $3 }'
     -| 83, 123, 291
</pre>
   <p>For this feature to work, write your program so that
<span class="command">gawk</span> treats your data as numeric:

<pre class="example">     $ echo 0123 123 0x123 | gawk '{ print $1, $2, $3 }'
     -| 0123 123 0x123
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>print</code> statement treats its expressions as strings. 
Although the fields can act as numbers when necessary,
they are still strings, so <code>print</code> does not try to treat them
numerically.  You may need to add zero to a field to force it to
be treated as a number.  For example:

<pre class="example">     $ echo 0123 123 0x123 | gawk --non-decimal-data '
     &gt; { print $1, $2, $3
     &gt;   print $1 + 0, $2 + 0, $3 + 0 }'
     -| 0123 123 0x123
     -| 83 123 291
</pre>
   <p>Because it is common to have decimal data with leading zeros, and because
using it could lead to surprising results, the default is to leave this
facility disabled.  If you want it, you must explicitly request it.

   <p><a name="index-programming-conventions_002c-_0040code_007b_002d_002dnon_002ddecimal_002ddata_007d-option-1402"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dnon_002ddecimal_002ddata_007d-option_002c-_0040code_007bstrtonum_007d-function-and-1403"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bstrtonum_007d-function-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_002d_002dnon_002ddecimal_002ddata_007d-option-and-1404"></a><strong>Caution:</strong>
<em>Use of this option is not recommended.</em>
It can break old programs very badly. 
Instead, use the <code>strtonum</code> function to convert your data
(see <a href="#Nondecimal_002dnumbers">Nondecimal-numbers</a>). 
This makes your programs easier to write and easier to read, and
leads to less surprising results.

send data to a separate program for
processing and then read the result.  This can always be
done with temporary files:

<pre class="example">     # write the data for processing
     tempfile = ("mydata." PROCINFO["pid"])
     while (<var>not done with data</var>)
         print <var>data</var> | ("subprogram &gt; " tempfile)
     close("subprogram &gt; " tempfile)
     
     # read the results, remove tempfile when done

     close(tempfile)
     system("rm " tempfile)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This works, but not elegantly.  Among other things, it requires that
the program be run in a directory that cannot be shared among users;
for example, <span class="file">/tmp</span> will not do, as another user might happen
to be using a temporary file with the same name.

open a <em>two-way</em> pipe to another process.  The second process is
termed a <dfn>coprocess</dfn>, since it runs in parallel with <span class="command">gawk</span>. 
The two-way connection is created using the new <span class="samp">|&amp;</span> operator
(borrowed from the Korn shell, <span class="command">ksh</span>):<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-52" name="fnd-52"><sup>52</sup></a>

<pre class="example">     do {
         print <var>data</var> |&amp; "subprogram"
         "subprogram" |&amp; getline results
     } while (<var>data left to process</var>)
     close("subprogram")
</pre>
   <p>The first time an I/O operation is executed using the <span class="samp">|&amp;</span>
operator, <span class="command">gawk</span> creates a two-way pipeline to a child process
that runs the other program.  Output created with <code>print</code>
or <code>printf</code> is written to the program's standard input, and
output from the program's standard output can be read by the <span class="command">gawk</span>
program using <code>getline</code>. 
As is the case with processes started by <span class="samp">|</span>, the subprogram
can be any program, or pipeline of programs, that can be started by
the shell.

   <p>There are some cautionary items to be aware of:

     <ul>
<li>As the code inside <span class="command">gawk</span> currently stands, the coprocess's
standard error goes to the same place that the parent <span class="command">gawk</span>'s
standard error goes. It is not possible to read the child's
standard error separately.

     <p><a name="index-deadlocks-1414"></a><a name="index-buffering_002c-input_002foutput-1415"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetline_007d-command_002c-deadlock-and-1416"></a><li>I/O buffering may be a problem.  <span class="command">gawk</span> automatically
flushes all output down the pipe to the child process. 
However, if the coprocess does not flush its output,
<span class="command">gawk</span> may hang when doing a <code>getline</code> in order to read
the coprocess's results.  This could lead to a situation
known as <dfn>deadlock</dfn>, where each process is waiting for the
other one to do something. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bclose_007d-function_002c-two_002dway-pipes-and-1417"></a>It is possible to close just one end of the two-way pipe to
a coprocess, by supplying a second argument to the <code>close</code>
function of either <code>"to"</code> or <code>"from"</code>
(see <a href="#Close-Files-And-Pipes">Close Files And Pipes</a>). 
These strings tell <span class="command">gawk</span> to close the end of the pipe
that sends data to the process or the end that reads from it,
respectively.

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bsort_007d-utility_002c-coprocesses-and-1418"></a>This is particularly necessary in order to use
the system <span class="command">sort</span> utility as part of a coprocess;
<span class="command">sort</span> must read <em>all</em> of its input
data before it can produce any output. 
The <span class="command">sort</span> program does not receive an end-of-file indication
until <span class="command">gawk</span> closes the write end of the pipe.

   <p>When you have finished writing data to the <span class="command">sort</span>
utility, you can close the <code>"to"</code> end of the pipe, and
then start reading sorted data via <code>getline</code>. 
For example:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN {
         command = "LC_ALL=C sort"
         n = split("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", a, "")
     
         for (i = n; i &gt; 0; i--)
             print a[i] |&amp; command
         close(command, "to")
     
         while ((command |&amp; getline line) &gt; 0)
             print "got", line
         close(command)
     }
</pre>
   <p>This program writes the letters of the alphabet in reverse order, one
per line, down the two-way pipe to <span class="command">sort</span>.  It then closes the
write end of the pipe, so that <span class="command">sort</span> receives an end-of-file
indication.  This causes <span class="command">sort</span> to sort the data and write the
sorted data back to the <span class="command">gawk</span> program.  Once all of the data
has been read, <span class="command">gawk</span> terminates the coprocess and exits.

   <p>As a side note, the assignment <span class="samp">LC_ALL=C</span> in the <span class="command">sort</span>
command ensures traditional Unix (ASCII) sorting from <span class="command">sort</span>.

   <p>Beginning with <span class="command">gawk</span> 3.1.2, you may use Pseudo-ttys (ptys) for
two-way communication instead of pipes, if your system supports them. 
This is done on a per-command basis, by setting a special element
in the <code>PROCINFO</code> array
(see <a href="#Auto_002dset">Auto-set</a>),
like so:

<pre class="example">     command = "sort -nr"           # command, saved in variable for convenience
     PROCINFO[command, "pty"] = 1   # update PROCINFO
     print ... |&amp; command       # start two-way pipe
     ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Using ptys avoids the buffer deadlock issues described earlier, at some
loss in performance.  If your system does not have ptys, or if all the
system's ptys are in use, <span class="command">gawk</span> automatically falls back to
using regular pipes.

<code>EMISTERED</code>: <i>A host is a host from coast to coast,<br>
and no-one can talk to host that's close,<br>
unless the host that isn't close<br>
is busy hung or dead.</i>
</blockquote>

   <p>In addition to being able to open a two-way pipeline to a coprocess
on the same system
(see <a href="#Two_002dway-I_002fO">Two-way I/O</a>),
it is possible to make a two-way connection to
another process on another system across an IP networking connection.

   <p>You can think of this as just a <em>very long</em> two-way pipeline to
a coprocess. 
The way <span class="command">gawk</span> decides that you want to use TCP/IP networking is
by recognizing special file names that begin with <span class="samp">/inet/</span>.

   <p>The full syntax of the special file name is
<span class="file">/inet/</span><var>protocol</var><span class="file">/</span><var>local-port</var><span class="file">/</span><var>remote-host</var><span class="file">/</span><var>remote-port</var>. 
The components are:

     <dl>
<dt><var>protocol</var><dd>The protocol to use over IP.  This must be either <span class="samp">tcp</span>,
<span class="samp">udp</span>, or <span class="samp">raw</span>, for a TCP, UDP, or raw IP connection,
respectively.  The use of TCP is recommended for most applications.

     <p><a name="index-raw-sockets-1425"></a><a name="index-sockets-1426"></a><strong>Caution:</strong> The use of raw sockets is not currently supported
in version 3.1 of <span class="command">gawk</span>.

     <br><dt><var>local-port</var><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetservbyname_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1427"></a>The local TCP or UDP port number to use.  Use a port number of <span class="samp">0</span>
when you want the system to pick a port. This is what you should do
when writing a TCP or UDP client. 
You may also use a well-known service name, such as <span class="samp">smtp</span>
or <span class="samp">http</span>, in which case <span class="command">gawk</span> attempts to determine
the predefined port number using the C <code>getservbyname</code> function.

     <br><dt><var>remote-host</var><dd>The IP address or fully-qualified domain name of the Internet
host to which you want to connect.

     <br><dt><var>remote-port</var><dd>The TCP or UDP port number to use on the given <var>remote-host</var>. 
Again, use <span class="samp">0</span> if you don't care, or else a well-known
service name. 
</dl>

   <p>Consider the following very simple example:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN {
       Service = "/inet/tcp/0/localhost/daytime"
       Service |&amp; getline
       print $0
       close(Service)
     }
</pre>
   <p>This program reads the current date and time from the local system's
TCP <span class="samp">daytime</span> server. 
It then prints the results and closes the connection.

   <p>Because this topic is extensive, the use of <span class="command">gawk</span> for
TCP/IP programming is documented separately. 
See <cite>TCP/IP Internetworking with </cite><span class="command">gawk</span>,
which comes as part of the <span class="command">gawk</span> distribution,
for a much more complete introduction and discussion, as well as
extensive examples.

Beginning with version 3.1 of <span class="command">gawk</span>, you may produce execution
traces of your <span class="command">awk</span> programs. 
This is done with a specially compiled version of <span class="command">gawk</span>,
called <span class="command">pgawk</span> (&ldquo;profiling <span class="command">gawk</span>&rdquo;).

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bawkprof_002eout_007d-file-1442"></a><a name="index-files_002c-_0040code_007bawkprof_002eout_007d-1443"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bpgawk_007d-program_002c-_0040code_007bawkprof_002eout_007d-file-1444"></a><span class="command">pgawk</span> is identical in every way to <span class="command">gawk</span>, except that when
it has finished running, it creates a profile of your program in a file
named <span class="file">awkprof.out</span>. 
Because it is profiling, it also executes up to 45% slower than
<span class="command">gawk</span> normally does.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dprofile_007d-option-1445"></a>As shown in the following example,
the <span class="option">--profile</span> option can be used to change the name of the file
where <span class="command">pgawk</span> will write the profile:

<pre class="example">     $ pgawk --profile=myprog.prof -f myprog.awk data1 data2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the above example, <span class="command">pgawk</span> places the profile in
<span class="file">myprog.prof</span> instead of in <span class="file">awkprof.out</span>.

   <p>Regular <span class="command">gawk</span> also accepts this option.  When called with just
<span class="option">--profile</span>, <span class="command">gawk</span> &ldquo;pretty prints&rdquo; the program into
<span class="file">awkprof.out</span>, without any execution counts.  You may supply an
option to <span class="option">--profile</span> to change the file name.  Here is a sample
session showing a simple <span class="command">awk</span> program, its input data, and the
results from running <span class="command">pgawk</span>.  First, the <span class="command">awk</span> program:

<pre class="example">     BEGIN { print "First BEGIN rule" }
     
     END { print "First END rule" }
     
     /foo/ {
         print "matched /foo/, gosh"
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= 3; i++)
             sing()
     }
     
     {
         if (/foo/)
             print "if is true"
         else
             print "else is true"
     }
     
     BEGIN { print "Second BEGIN rule" }
     
     END { print "Second END rule" }
     
     function sing(    dummy)
     {
         print "I gotta be me!"
     }
</pre>
   <p>Following is the input data:

<pre class="example">     foo
     bar
     baz
     foo
     junk
</pre>
   <p>Here is the <span class="file">awkprof.out</span> that results from running <span class="command">pgawk</span>
on this program and data (this example also illustrates that <span class="command">awk</span>
programmers sometimes have to work late):

<pre class="example">             # gawk profile, created Sun Aug 13 00:00:15 2000
     
             # BEGIN block(s)
     
             BEGIN {
          1          print "First BEGIN rule"
          1          print "Second BEGIN rule"

             }
     
             # Functions, listed alphabetically
     
          6  function sing(dummy)
             {
          6          print "I gotta be me!"
             }
</pre>
   <p>This example illustrates many of the basic rules for profiling output. 
The rules are as follows:

     <ul>
<li>The program is printed in the order <code>BEGIN</code> rule,
pattern/action rules, <code>END</code> rule and functions, listed
alphabetically. 
Multiple <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules are merged together.

     <p><a name="index-patterns_002c-counts-1448"></a><li>Pattern-action rules have two counts. 
The first count, to the left of the rule, shows how many times
the rule's pattern was <em>tested</em>. 
The second count, to the right of the rule's opening left brace
in a comment,
shows how many times the rule's action was <em>executed</em>. 
The difference between the two indicates how many times the rule's
pattern evaluated to false.

     <li>Similarly,
the count for an <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> statement shows how many times
the condition was tested. 
To the right of the opening left brace for the <code>if</code>'s body
is a count showing how many times the condition was true. 
The count for the <code>else</code>
indicates how many times the test failed.

     <p><a name="index-loops_002c-count-for-header-1449"></a><li>The count for a loop header (such as <code>for</code>
or <code>while</code>) shows how many times the loop test was executed. 
(Because of this, you can't just look at the count on the first
statement in a rule to determine how many times the rule was executed. 
If the first statement is a loop, the count is misleading.)

     <p><a name="index-functions_002c-user_002ddefined_002c-counts-1450"></a><a name="index-user_002ddefined_002c-functions_002c-counts-1451"></a><li>For user-defined functions, the count next to the <code>function</code>
keyword indicates how many times the function was called. 
The counts next to the statements in the body show how many times
those statements were executed.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0040_007b_0040_007d_007d-_0028braces_0029_002c-_0040command_007bpgawk_007d-program-1452"></a><a name="index-braces-_0028_0040code_007b_0040_007b_0040_007d_007d_0029_002c-_0040command_007bpgawk_007d-program-1453"></a><li>The layout uses &ldquo;K&amp;R&rdquo; style with tabs. 
Braces are used everywhere, even when
the body of an <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, or loop is only a single statement.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0028_0029_007d-_0028parentheses_0029_002c-_0040command_007bpgawk_007d-program-1454"></a><a name="index-parentheses-_0040code_007b_0028_0029_007d_002c-_0040command_007bpgawk_007d-program-1455"></a><li>Parentheses are used only where needed, as indicated by the structure
of the program and the precedence rules. 
<!-- extra verbiage here satisfies the copyeditor. ugh. -->
For example, <span class="samp">(3 + 5) * 4</span> means add three plus five, then multiply
the total by four.  However, <span class="samp">3 + 5 * 4</span> has no parentheses, and
means <span class="samp">3 + (5 * 4)</span>.

     <li>Parentheses are used around the arguments to <code>print</code>
and <code>printf</code> only when
the <code>print</code> or <code>printf</code> statement is followed by a redirection. 
Similarly, if
the target of a redirection isn't a scalar, it gets parenthesized.

     <li><span class="command">pgawk</span> supplies leading comments in
front of the <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules,
the pattern/action rules, and the functions.

   </ul>

   <p>The profiled version of your program may not look exactly like what you
typed when you wrote it.  This is because <span class="command">pgawk</span> creates the
profiled version by &ldquo;pretty printing&rdquo; its internal representation of
the program.  The advantage to this is that <span class="command">pgawk</span> can produce
a standard representation.  The disadvantage is that all source-code
comments are lost, as are the distinctions among multiple <code>BEGIN</code>
and <code>END</code> rules.  Also, things such as:

<pre class="example">     /foo/
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">come out as:

<pre class="example">     /foo/   {
         print $0
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which is correct, but possibly surprising.

   <p><a name="index-profiling-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-dynamically-1456"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bpgawk_007d-program_002c-dynamic-profiling-1457"></a>Besides creating profiles when a program has completed,
<span class="command">pgawk</span> can produce a profile while it is running. 
This is useful if your <span class="command">awk</span> program goes into an
infinite loop and you want to see what has been executed. 
To use this feature, run <span class="command">pgawk</span> in the background:

<pre class="example">     $ pgawk -f myprog &amp;
     [1] 13992
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bkill_007d-command_0040comma_007b_007d-dynamic-profiling-1458"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bUSR1_007d-signal-1459"></a><a name="index-signals_002c-_0040code_007bUSR1_007d_002f_0040code_007bSIGUSR1_007d-1460"></a>The shell prints a job number and process ID number; in this case, 13992. 
Use the <span class="command">kill</span> command to send the <code>USR1</code> signal
to <span class="command">pgawk</span>:

<pre class="example">     $ kill -USR1 13992
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As usual, the profiled version of the program is written to
<span class="file">awkprof.out</span>, or to a different file if you use the <span class="option">--profile</span>
option.

   <p>Along with the regular profile, as shown earlier, the profile
includes a trace of any active functions:

<pre class="example">     # Function Call Stack:
     
     #   3. baz
     #   2. bar
     #   1. foo
     # -- main --
</pre>
   <p>You may send <span class="command">pgawk</span> the <code>USR1</code> signal as many times as you like. 
Each time, the profile and function call trace are appended to the output
profile file.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bHUP_007d-signal-1461"></a><a name="index-signals_002c-_0040code_007bHUP_007d_002f_0040code_007bSIGHUP_007d-1462"></a>If you use the <code>HUP</code> signal instead of the <code>USR1</code> signal,
<span class="command">pgawk</span> produces the profile and the function call trace and then exits.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bINT_007d-signal-_0028MS_002dDOS_0029-1463"></a><a name="index-signals_002c-_0040code_007bINT_007d_002f_0040code_007bSIGINT_007d-_0028MS_002dDOS_0029-1464"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bQUIT_007d-signal-_0028MS_002dDOS_0029-1465"></a><a name="index-signals_002c-_0040code_007bQUIT_007d_002f_0040code_007bSIGQUIT_007d-_0028MS_002dDOS_0029-1466"></a>When <span class="command">pgawk</span> runs on MS-DOS or MS-Windows, it uses the
<code>INT</code> and <code>QUIT</code> signals for producing the profile and, in
the case of the <code>INT</code> signal, <span class="command">pgawk</span> exits.  This is
because these systems don't support the <span class="command">kill</span> command, so the
only signals you can deliver to a program are those generated by the
keyboard.  The <code>INT</code> signal is generated by the
<kbd>Ctrl-&lt;C&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl-&lt;BREAK&gt;</kbd> key, while the
<code>QUIT</code> signal is generated by the <kbd>Ctrl-&lt;\&gt;</kbd> key.

<h2 class="chapter">11 Running <span class="command">awk</span> and <span class="command">gawk</span></h2>

<p>This chapter covers how to run awk, both POSIX-standard
and <span class="command">gawk</span>-specific command-line options, and what
<span class="command">awk</span> and
<span class="command">gawk</span> do with non-option arguments. 
It then proceeds to cover how <span class="command">gawk</span> searches for source files,
obsolete options and/or features, and known bugs in <span class="command">gawk</span>. 
This chapter rounds out the discussion of <span class="command">awk</span>
as a program and as a language.

   <p>While a number of the options and features described here were
discussed in passing earlier in the book, this chapter provides the
full details.

There are two ways to run <span class="command">awk</span>&mdash;with an explicit program or with
one or more program files.  Here are templates for both of them; items
enclosed in [<small class="dots">...</small>] in these templates are optional:

<pre class="example">     awk <span class="roman">[</span><var>options</var><span class="roman">]</span> -f progfile <span class="roman">[</span><code>--</code><span class="roman">]</span> <var>file</var> ...
     awk <span class="roman">[</span><var>options</var><span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">[</span><code>--</code><span class="roman">]</span> '<var>program</var>' <var>file</var> ...
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-GNU-long-options-1471"></a><a name="index-long-options-1472"></a><a name="index-options_002c-long-1473"></a>Besides traditional one-letter POSIX-style options, <span class="command">gawk</span> also
supports GNU long options.

   <p><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-invoking-_0040command_007bawk_007d-1474"></a><a name="index-lint-checking_002c-empty-programs-1475"></a>It is possible to invoke <span class="command">awk</span> with an empty program:

<pre class="example">     awk '' datafile1 datafile2
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dlint_007d-option-1476"></a>Doing so makes little sense, though; <span class="command">awk</span> exits
silently when given an empty program. 
(d.c.) 
If <span class="option">--lint</span> has
been specified on the command line, <span class="command">gawk</span> issues a
warning that the program is empty.

<a name="index-options_002c-long-1480"></a>
Options begin with a dash and consist of a single character. 
GNU-style long options consist of two dashes and a keyword. 
The keyword can be abbreviated, as long as the abbreviation allows the option
to be uniquely identified.  If the option takes an argument, then the
keyword is either immediately followed by an equals sign (<span class="samp">=</span>) and the
argument's value, or the keyword and the argument's value are separated
by whitespace. 
If a particular option with a value is given more than once, it is the
last value that counts.

   <p><a name="index-POSIX-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-GNU-long-options-and-1481"></a>Each long option for <span class="command">gawk</span> has a corresponding
POSIX-style option. 
The long and short options are
interchangeable in all contexts. 
The options and their meanings are as follows:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-F </code><var>fs</var><dt><code>--field-separator </code><var>fs</var><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002dF_007d-option-1482"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dfield_002dseparator_007d-option-1483"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bFS_007d-variable_002c-_0040code_007b_002d_002dfield_002dseparator_007d-option-and-1484"></a>Sets the <code>FS</code> variable to <var>fs</var>
(see <a href="#Field-Separators">Field Separators</a>).

     <br><dt><code>-f </code><var>source-file</var><dt><code>--file </code><var>source-file</var><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002df_007d-option-1485"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dfile_007d-option-1486"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-location-of-1487"></a>Indicates that the <span class="command">awk</span> program is to be found in <var>source-file</var>
instead of in the first non-option argument.

     <br><dt><code>-v </code><var>var</var><code>=</code><var>val</var><dt><code>--assign </code><var>var</var><code>=</code><var>val</var><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002dv_007d-option-1488"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dassign_007d-option-1489"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-setting-1490"></a>Sets the variable <var>var</var> to the value <var>val</var> <em>before</em>
execution of the program begins.  Such variable values are available
inside the <code>BEGIN</code> rule
(see <a href="#Other-Arguments">Other Arguments</a>).

     <p>The <span class="option">-v</span> option can only set one variable, but it can be used
more than once, setting another variable each time, like this:
<span class="samp">awk -v&nbsp;foo=1<!-- /@w --> -v&nbsp;bar=2<!-- /@w --> ...</span>.

     <p><a name="index-built_002din-variables_002c-_0040code_007b_002dv_007d-option_0040comma_007b_007d-setting-with-1491"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-built_002din_002c-_0040code_007b_002dv_007d-option_0040comma_007b_007d-setting-with-1492"></a><strong>Caution:</strong>  Using <span class="option">-v</span> to set the values of the built-in
variables may lead to surprising results.  <span class="command">awk</span> will reset the
values of those variables as it needs to, possibly ignoring any
predefined value you may have given.

     <br><dt><code>-mf </code><var>N</var><dt><code>-mr </code><var>N</var><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002dmf_007d_002f_0040code_007b_002dmr_007d-options-1493"></a><a name="index-memory_002c-setting-limits-1494"></a>Sets various memory limits to the value <var>N</var>.  The <span class="samp">f</span> flag sets
the maximum number of fields and the <span class="samp">r</span> flag sets the maximum
record size.  These two flags and the <span class="option">-m</span> option are from the
Bell Laboratories research version of Unix <span class="command">awk</span>.  They are provided
for compatibility but otherwise ignored by
<span class="command">gawk</span>, since <span class="command">gawk</span> has no predefined limits. 
(The Bell Laboratories <span class="command">awk</span> no longer needs these options;
it continues to accept them to avoid breaking old programs.)

     <br><dt><code>-W </code><var>gawk-opt</var><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002dW_007d-option-1495"></a>Following the POSIX standard, implementation-specific
options are supplied as arguments to the <span class="option">-W</span> option.  These options
also have corresponding GNU-style long options. 
Note that the long options may be abbreviated, as long as
the abbreviations remain unique. 
The full list of <span class="command">gawk</span>-specific options is provided next.

     <br><dt><code>--</code><dd><a name="index-command-line_002c-options_002c-end-of-1496"></a><a name="index-options_002c-command_002dline_002c-end-of-1497"></a>Signals the end of the command-line options.  The following arguments
are not treated as options even if they begin with <span class="samp">-</span>.  This
interpretation of <span class="option">--</span> follows the POSIX argument parsing
conventions.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_007d-_0028hyphen_0029_002c-filenames-beginning-with-1498"></a><a name="index-hyphen-_0028_0040code_007b_002d_007d_0029_002c-filenames-beginning-with-1499"></a>This is useful if you have file names that start with <span class="samp">-</span>,
or in shell scripts, if you have file names that will be specified
by the user that could start with <span class="samp">-</span>. 
</dl>
   <!-- ENDOFRANGE gnulo -->
<!-- ENDOFRANGE longo -->

   <p>The previous list described options mandated by the POSIX standard,
as well as options available in the Bell Laboratories version of <span class="command">awk</span>. 
The following list describes <span class="command">gawk</span>-specific options:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-W compat</code><dt><code>-W traditional</code><dt><code>--compat</code><dt><code>--traditional</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dcompat_007d-option-1500"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dtraditional_007d-option-1501"></a><a name="index-compatibility-mode-_0028_0040command_007bgawk_007d_0029_002c-specifying-1502"></a>Specifies <dfn>compatibility mode</dfn>, in which the GNU extensions to
the <span class="command">awk</span> language are disabled, so that <span class="command">gawk</span> behaves just
like the Bell Laboratories research version of Unix <span class="command">awk</span>. 
<span class="option">--traditional</span> is the preferred form of this option. 
See <a href="#POSIX_002fGNU">POSIX/GNU</a>,
which summarizes the extensions.  Also see
<a href="#Compatibility-Mode">Compatibility Mode</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-W copyright</code><dt><code>--copyright</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dcopyright_007d-option-1503"></a><a name="index-GPL-_0028General-Public-License_0029_002c-printing-1504"></a>Print the short version of the General Public License and then exit.

     <br><dt><code>-W copyleft</code><dt><code>--copyleft</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dcopyleft_007d-option-1505"></a>Just like <span class="option">--copyright</span>. 
This option may disappear in a future version of <span class="command">gawk</span>.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002ddump_002dvariables_007d-option-1506"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bawkvars_002eout_007d-file-1507"></a><a name="index-files_002c-_0040code_007bawkvars_002eout_007d-1508"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-global_002c-printing-list-of-1509"></a><br><dt><code>-W dump-variables</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=</code><var>file</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>--dump-variables</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=</code><var>file</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Prints a sorted list of global variables, their types, and final values
to <var>file</var>.  If no <var>file</var> is provided, <span class="command">gawk</span> prints this
list to the file named <span class="file">awkvars.out</span> in the current directory.

     <p><a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-typographical-errors_0040comma_007b_007d-global-variables-1510"></a>Having a list of all global variables is a good way to look for
typographical errors in your programs. 
You would also use this option if you have a large program with a lot of
functions, and you want to be sure that your functions don't
inadvertently use global variables that you meant to be local. 
(This is a particularly easy mistake to make with simple variable
names like <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, etc.)

     <br><dt><code>-W exec </code><var>file</var><dt><code>--exec </code><var>file</var><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dexec_007d-option-1511"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-location-of-1512"></a><a name="index-CGI_002c-_0040command_007bawk_007d-scripts-for-1513"></a>Similar to <span class="option">-f</span>, reads <span class="command">awk</span> program text from <var>file</var>. 
There are two differences.  The fist is that this option also terminates option processing; anything
else on the command line is passed on directly to the <span class="command">awk</span> program. 
The second is that command line variable assignments of the form
<var>var</var><span class="samp">=</span><var>value</var> are disallowed.

     <p>This option is particularly necessary for World Wide Web CGI applications
that pass arguments through the URL; using this option prevents a malicious
(or other) user from passing in options, assignments, or <span class="command">awk</span> source code (via
<span class="option">--source</span>) to the CGI application.  This option should be used
with <span class="samp">#!</span> scripts (see <a href="#Executable-Scripts">Executable Scripts</a>), like so:

     <pre class="example">          #! /usr/local/bin/gawk --exec
          
          <var>awk program here <small class="dots">...</small></var>
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-W gen-po</code><dt><code>--gen-po</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dgen_002dpo_007d-option-1514"></a><a name="index-portable-object-files_002c-generating-1515"></a><a name="index-files_002c-portable-object_002c-generating-1516"></a>Analyzes the source program and
generates a GNU <code>gettext</code> Portable Object file on standard
output for all string constants that have been marked for translation. 
See <a href="#Internationalization">Internationalization</a>,
for information about this option.

     <br><dt><code>-W help</code><dt><code>-W usage</code><dt><code>--help</code><dt><code>--usage</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dhelp_007d-option-1517"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dusage_007d-option-1518"></a><a name="index-GNU-long-options_002c-printing-list-of-1519"></a><a name="index-options_002c-printing-list-of-1520"></a><a name="index-printing_002c-list-of-options-1521"></a>Prints a &ldquo;usage&rdquo; message summarizing the short and long style options
that <span class="command">gawk</span> accepts and then exit.

     <br><dt><code>-W lint</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=fatal</code><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>--lint</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=fatal</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dlint_007d-option-1522"></a><a name="index-lint-checking_002c-issuing-warnings-1523"></a><a name="index-warnings_002c-issuing-1524"></a>Warns about constructs that are dubious or nonportable to
other <span class="command">awk</span> implementations. 
Some warnings are issued when <span class="command">gawk</span> first reads your program.  Others
are issued at runtime, as your program executes. 
With an optional argument of <span class="samp">fatal</span>,
lint warnings become fatal errors. 
This may be drastic, but its use will certainly encourage the
development of cleaner <span class="command">awk</span> programs. 
With an optional argument of <span class="samp">invalid</span>, only warnings about things that are
actually invalid are issued. (This is not fully implemented yet.)

     <p>Some warnings are only printed once, even if the dubious constructs they warn
about occur multiple times in your <span class="command">awk</span> program.  Thus, when eliminating
problems pointed out by <span class="option">--lint</span>, you should take care to search for all
occurrences of each inappropriate construct. As <span class="command">awk</span> programs are
usually short, doing so is not burdensome.

     <br><dt><code>-W lint-old</code><dt><code>--lint-old</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dlint_002dold_007d-option-1525"></a>Warns about constructs that are not available in the original version of

for <span class="option">--posix</span>
(see <a href="#Field-Separators">Field Separators</a>).

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002df_007d-option_002c-on-command-line-1560"></a>The <span class="option">-f</span> option may be used more than once on the command line. 
If it is, <span class="command">awk</span> reads its program source from all of the named files, as
if they had been concatenated together into one big file.  This is
useful for creating libraries of <span class="command">awk</span> functions.  These functions
can be written once and then retrieved from a standard place, instead
of having to be included into each individual program. 
(As mentioned in
<a href="#Definition-Syntax">Definition Syntax</a>,
function names must be unique.)

   <p>Library functions can still be used, even if the program is entered at the terminal,
by specifying <span class="samp">-f /dev/tty</span>.  After typing your program,
type <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd> (the end-of-file character) to terminate it. 
(You may also use <span class="samp">-f -</span> to read program source from the standard
input but then you will not be able to also use the standard input as a
source of data.)

   <p>Because it is clumsy using the standard <span class="command">awk</span> mechanisms to mix source
file and command-line <span class="command">awk</span> programs, <span class="command">gawk</span> provides the
<span class="option">--source</span> option.  This does not require you to pre-empt the standard
input for your source code; it allows you to easily mix command-line
and library source code
(see <a href="#AWKPATH-Variable">AWKPATH Variable</a>).

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002dsource_007d-option-1561"></a>If no <span class="option">-f</span> or <span class="option">--source</span> option is specified, then <span class="command">gawk</span>

then <span class="command">gawk</span> behaves in strict POSIX mode, exactly as if
you had supplied the <span class="option">--posix</span> command-line option. 
Many GNU programs look for this environment variable to turn on
strict POSIX mode. If <span class="option">--lint</span> is supplied on the command line
and <span class="command">gawk</span> turns on POSIX mode because of <span class="env">POSIXLY_CORRECT</span>,
then it issues a warning message indicating that POSIX
mode is in effect. 
You would typically set this variable in your shell's startup file. 
For a Bourne-compatible shell (such as <span class="command">bash</span>), you would add these
lines to the <span class="file">.profile</span> file in your home directory:

<pre class="example">     POSIXLY_CORRECT=true
     export POSIXLY_CORRECT

shell,<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-53" name="fnd-53"><sup>53</sup></a>

but it is good for testing the portability of your programs to other

<p><a name="index-command-line_002c-arguments-1567"></a><a name="index-arguments_002c-command_002dline-1568"></a>
Any additional arguments on the command line are normally treated as
input files to be processed in the order specified.   However, an
argument that has the form <var>var</var><code>=</code><var>value</var>, assigns
the value <var>value</var> to the variable <var>var</var>&mdash;it does not specify a
file at all. 
(This was discussed earlier in
<a href="#Assignment-Options">Assignment Options</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bARGIND_007d-variable_002c-command_002dline-arguments-1569"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bARGC_007d_002f_0040code_007bARGV_007d-variables_002c-command_002dline-arguments-1570"></a>All these arguments are made available to your <span class="command">awk</span> program in the
<code>ARGV</code> array (see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>).  Command-line options
and the program text (if present) are omitted from <code>ARGV</code>. 
All other arguments, including variable assignments, are
included.   As each element of <code>ARGV</code> is processed, <span class="command">gawk</span>
sets the variable <code>ARGIND</code> to the index in <code>ARGV</code> of the
current element.

   <p><a name="index-input-files_002c-variable-assignments-and-1571"></a>The distinction between file name arguments and variable-assignment
arguments is made when <span class="command">awk</span> is about to open the next input file. 
At that point in execution, it checks the file name to see whether
it is really a variable assignment; if so, <span class="command">awk</span> sets the variable
instead of reading a file.

   <p>Therefore, the variables actually receive the given values after all
previously specified files have been read.  In particular, the values of
variables assigned in this fashion are <em>not</em> available inside a
<code>BEGIN</code> rule
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>),
because such rules are run before <span class="command">awk</span> begins scanning the argument list.

   <p><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-escape-sequences-1572"></a>The variable values given on the command line are processed for escape
sequences (see <a href="#Escape-Sequences">Escape Sequences</a>). 
(d.c.)

   <p>In some earlier implementations of <span class="command">awk</span>, when a variable assignment
occurred before any file names, the assignment would happen <em>before</em>
the <code>BEGIN</code> rule was executed.  <span class="command">awk</span>'s behavior was thus
inconsistent; some command-line assignments were available inside the
<code>BEGIN</code> rule, while others were not.  Unfortunately,
some applications came to depend
upon this &ldquo;feature.&rdquo;  When <span class="command">awk</span> was changed to be more consistent,
the <span class="option">-v</span> option was added to accommodate applications that depended
upon the old behavior.

   <p>The variable assignment feature is most useful for assigning to variables
such as <code>RS</code>, <code>OFS</code>, and <code>ORS</code>, which control input and
output formats before scanning the data files.  It is also useful for
controlling state if multiple passes are needed over a data file.  For
example:

   <p><a name="index-files_002c-multiple-passes-over-1573"></a>
<pre class="example">     awk 'pass == 1  { <var>pass 1 stuff</var> }
          pass == 2  { <var>pass 2 stuff</var> }' pass=1 mydata pass=2 mydata
</pre>
   <p>Given the variable assignment feature, the <span class="option">-F</span> option for setting
the value of <code>FS</code> is not
strictly necessary.  It remains for historical compatibility.

<h3 class="section">11.4 The <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> Environment Variable</h3>

<p><a name="index-_0040env_007bAWKPATH_007d-environment-variable-1574"></a><a name="index-directories_002c-searching-1575"></a><a name="index-search-paths_002c-for-source-files-1576"></a><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-_0040code_007bAWKPATH_007d-environment-variable-1577"></a>In most <span class="command">awk</span>
implementations, you must supply a precise path name for each program
file, unless the file is in the current directory. 
But in <span class="command">gawk</span>, if the file name supplied to the <span class="option">-f</span> option
does not contain a <span class="samp">/</span>, then <span class="command">gawk</span> searches a list of
directories (called the <dfn>search path</dfn>), one by one, looking for a
file with the specified name.

   <p>The search path is a string consisting of directory names
separated by colons.  <span class="command">gawk</span> gets its search path from the
<span class="env">AWKPATH</span> environment variable.  If that variable does not exist,
<span class="command">gawk</span> uses a default path,
<span class="samp">.:/usr/local/share/awk</span>.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-54" name="fnd-54"><sup>54</sup></a> (Programs written for use by
system administrators should use an <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> variable that
does not include the current directory, <span class="file">.</span>.)

   <p>The search path feature is particularly useful for building libraries
of useful <span class="command">awk</span> functions.  The library files can be placed in a
standard directory in the default path and then specified on
the command line with a short file name.  Otherwise, the full file name
would have to be typed for each file.

   <p>By using both the <span class="option">--source</span> and <span class="option">-f</span> options, your command-line
<span class="command">awk</span> programs can use facilities in <span class="command">awk</span> library files
(see <a href="#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>). 
Path searching is not done if <span class="command">gawk</span> is in compatibility mode. 
This is true for both <span class="option">--traditional</span> and <span class="option">--posix</span>. 
See <a href="#Options">Options</a>.

   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you want files in the current directory to be found,
you must include the current directory in the path, either by including
<span class="file">.</span> explicitly in the path or by writing a null entry in the
path.  (A null entry is indicated by starting or ending the path with a
colon or by placing two colons next to each other (<span class="samp">::</span>).)  If the
current directory is not included in the path, then files cannot be
found in the current directory.  This path search mechanism is identical
to the shell's. 
<!-- someday, @cite{The Bourne Again Shell}.... -->
</blockquote>

   <p>Starting with version 3.0, if <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> is not defined in the
environment, <span class="command">gawk</span> places its default search path into
<code>ENVIRON["AWKPATH"]</code>. This makes it easy to determine
the actual search path that <span class="command">gawk</span> will use
from within an <span class="command">awk</span> program.

   <p>While you can change <code>ENVIRON["AWKPATH"]</code> within your <span class="command">awk</span>
program, this has no effect on the running program's behavior.  This makes
sense: the <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> environment variable is used to find the program
source files.  Once your program is running, all the files have been
found, and <span class="command">gawk</span> no longer needs to use <span class="env">AWKPATH</span>.

<a name="index-functions_002c-user_002ddefined_002c-library-of-1598"></a>
<a href="#User_002ddefined">User-defined</a>, describes how to write
your own <span class="command">awk</span> functions.  Writing functions is important, because
it allows you to encapsulate algorithms and program tasks in a single
place.  It simplifies programming, making program development more
manageable, and making programs more readable.

   <p>One valuable way to learn a new programming language is to <em>read</em>
programs in that language.  To that end, this chapter
and <a href="#Sample-Programs">Sample Programs</a>,
provide a good-sized body of code for you to read,
and hopefully, to learn from.

<!-- 2e: USE TEXINFO-2 FUNCTION DEFINITION STUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
<p>This chapter presents a library of useful <span class="command">awk</span> functions. 
Many of the sample programs presented later in this Web page
use these functions. 
The functions are presented here in a progression from simple to complex.

   <p><a name="index-Texinfo-1599"></a><a href="#Extract-Program">Extract Program</a>,
presents a program that you can use to extract the source code for
these example library functions and programs from the Texinfo source
for this Web page. 
(This has already been done as part of the <span class="command">gawk</span> distribution.)

   <p>If you have written one or more useful, general-purpose <span class="command">awk</span> functions
and would like to contribute them to the author's collection of <span class="command">awk</span>
programs, see
<a href="#How-To-Contribute">How To Contribute</a>, for more information.

   <p><a name="index-portability_002c-example-programs-1600"></a>The programs in this chapter and in
<a href="#Sample-Programs">Sample Programs</a>,
freely use features that are <span class="command">gawk</span>-specific. 
Rewriting these programs for different implementations of awk is pretty straightforward.

   <p>Diagnostic error messages are sent to <span class="file">/dev/stderr</span>. 
Use <span class="samp">| "cat 1&gt;&amp;2"</span> instead of <span class="samp">&gt; "/dev/stderr"</span> if your system
does not have a <span class="file">/dev/stderr</span>, or if you cannot use <span class="command">gawk</span>.

   <p>A number of programs use <code>nextfile</code>
(see <a href="#Nextfile-Statement">Nextfile Statement</a>)
to skip any remaining input in the input file. 
<a href="#Nextfile-Function">Nextfile Function</a>,
shows you how to write a function that does the same thing.

You can achieve almost the same effect<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-55" name="fnd-55"><sup>55</sup></a> by adding the following rule to the
beginning of the program:

<pre class="example">     # ignore case

   <p class="noindent">Also, verify that all regexp and string constants used in

<h3 class="section">12.1 Naming Library Function Global Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-names_002c-arrays_002fvariables-1603"></a><a name="index-names_002c-functions-1604"></a><a name="index-namespace-issues-1605"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-documenting-1606"></a><a name="index-documentation_002c-of-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs-1607"></a>Due to the way the <span class="command">awk</span> language evolved, variables are either
<dfn>global</dfn> (usable by the entire program) or <dfn>local</dfn> (usable just by
a specific function).  There is no intermediate state analogous to
<code>static</code> variables in C.

   <p><a name="index-variables_002c-global_002c-for-library-functions-1608"></a><a name="index-private-variables-1609"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-private-1610"></a>Library functions often need to have global variables that they can use to
preserve state information between calls to the function&mdash;for example,
<code>getopt</code>'s variable <code>_opti</code>
(see <a href="#Getopt-Function">Getopt Function</a>). 
Such variables are called <dfn>private</dfn>, since the only functions that need to
use them are the ones in the library.

   <p>When writing a library function, you should try to choose names for your
private variables that will not conflict with any variables used by
either another library function or a user's main program.  For example, a
name like <span class="samp">i</span> or <span class="samp">j</span> is not a good choice, because user programs
often use variable names like these for their own purposes.

   <p><a name="index-programming-conventions_002c-private-variable-names-1611"></a>The example programs shown in this chapter all start the names of their
private variables with an underscore (<span class="samp">_</span>).  Users generally don't use
leading underscores in their variable names, so this convention immediately
decreases the chances that the variable name will be accidentally shared
with the user's program.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005f_007d-_0028underscore_0029_002c-in-names-of-private-variables-1612"></a><a name="index-underscore-_0028_0040code_007b_005f_007d_0029_002c-in-names-of-private-variables-1613"></a>In addition, several of the library functions use a prefix that helps
indicate what function or set of functions use the variables&mdash;for example,
<code>_pw_byname</code> in the user database routines
(see <a href="#Passwd-Functions">Passwd Functions</a>). 
This convention is recommended, since it even further decreases the
chance of inadvertent conflict among variable names.  Note that this
convention is used equally well for variable names and for private
function names as well.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-56" name="fnd-56"><sup>56</sup></a>

   <p>As a final note on variable naming, if a function makes global variables
available for use by a main program, it is a good convention to start that
variable's name with a capital letter&mdash;for
example, <code>getopt</code>'s <code>Opterr</code> and <code>Optind</code> variables
(see <a href="#Getopt-Function">Getopt Function</a>). 
The leading capital letter indicates that it is global, while the fact that
the variable name is not all capital letters indicates that the variable is
not one of <span class="command">awk</span>'s built-in variables, such as <code>FS</code>.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_002d_002ddump_002dvariables_007d-option-1614"></a>It is also important that <em>all</em> variables in library
functions that do not need to save state are, in fact, declared
local.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-57" name="fnd-57"><sup>57</sup></a> If this is not done, the variable
could accidentally be used in the user's program, leading to bugs that
are very difficult to track down:

<pre class="example">     function lib_func(x, y,    l1, l2)
     {
         ...
         <var>use variable</var> some_var   # some_var should be local
         ...                   # but is not by oversight
     }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-arrays_002c-associative_002c-library-functions-and-1615"></a><a name="index-libraries-of-_0040command_007bawk_007d-functions_002c-associative-arrays-and-1616"></a><a name="index-functions_002c-library_002c-associative-arrays-and-1617"></a><a name="index-Tcl-1618"></a>A different convention, common in the Tcl community, is to use a single
associative array to hold the values needed by the library function(s), or
&ldquo;package.&rdquo;  This significantly decreases the number of actual global names
in use.  For example, the functions described in
<a href="#Passwd-Functions">Passwd Functions</a>,
might have used array elements <code>PW_data["inited"]<!-- /@w --></code>, <code>PW_data["total"]<!-- /@w --></code>,
<code>PW_data["count"]<!-- /@w --></code>, and <code>PW_data["awklib"]<!-- /@w --></code>, instead of
<code>_pw_inited<!-- /@w --></code>, <code>_pw_awklib<!-- /@w --></code>, <code>_pw_total<!-- /@w --></code>,
and <code>_pw_count<!-- /@w --></code>.

   <p>The conventions presented in this section are exactly
that: conventions. You are not required to write your programs this
way&mdash;we merely recommend that you do so.

<a href="#Nextfile-Statement">Nextfile Statement</a>,
is a <span class="command">gawk</span>-specific extension&mdash;it is not available in most other
implementations of <span class="command">awk</span>.  This section shows two versions of a
<code>nextfile</code> function that you can use to simulate <span class="command">gawk</span>'s
<code>nextfile</code> statement if you cannot use <span class="command">gawk</span>.

   <p>A first attempt at writing a <code>nextfile</code> function is as follows:

<pre class="example">     # nextfile --- skip remaining records in current file
     # this should be read in before the "main" awk program
     
     function nextfile()    { _abandon_ = FILENAME; next }
     _abandon_ == FILENAME  { next }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-programming-conventions_002c-_0040code_007bnextfile_007d-statement-1624"></a>Because it supplies a rule that must be executed first, this file should
be included before the main program. This rule compares the current
data file's name (which is always in the <code>FILENAME</code> variable) to
a private variable named <code>_abandon_</code>.  If the file name matches,
then the action part of the rule executes a <code>next</code> statement to
go on to the next record.  (The use of <span class="samp">_</span> in the variable name is
a convention.  It is discussed more fully in
<a href="#Library-Names">Library Names</a>.)

   <p>The use of the <code>next</code> statement effectively creates a loop that reads
all the records from the current data file. 
The end of the file is eventually reached and
a new data file is opened, changing the value of <code>FILENAME</code>. 
Once this happens, the comparison of <code>_abandon_</code> to <code>FILENAME</code>
fails, and execution continues with the first rule of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; program.

   <p>The <code>nextfile</code> function itself simply sets the value of <code>_abandon_</code>
and then executes a <code>next</code> statement to start the
loop.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bnextfile_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1625"></a>This initial version has a subtle problem. 
If the same data file is listed <em>twice</em> on the command line,
one right after the other
or even with just a variable assignment between them,
this code skips right through the file a second time, even though
it should stop when it gets to the end of the first occurrence. 
A second version of <code>nextfile</code> that remedies this problem
is shown here:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/nextfile.awk -->
     # nextfile --- skip remaining records in current file
     # correctly handle successive occurrences of the same file
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/nextfile.awk -->
     # this should be read in before the "main" awk program
     
     function nextfile()   { _abandon_ = FILENAME; next }
     
     _abandon_ == FILENAME {
           if (FNR == 1)
               _abandon_ = ""
           else
               next
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <code>nextfile</code> function has not changed.  It makes <code>_abandon_</code>
equal to the current file name and then executes a <code>next</code> statement. 
The <code>next</code> statement reads the next record and increments <code>FNR</code>
so that <code>FNR</code> is guaranteed to have a value of at least two. 
However, if <code>nextfile</code> is called for the last record in the file,
then <span class="command">awk</span> closes the current data file and moves on to the next
one.  Upon doing so, <code>FILENAME</code> is set to the name of the new file
and <code>FNR</code> is reset to one.  If this next file is the same as
the previous one, <code>_abandon_</code> is still equal to <code>FILENAME</code>. 
However, <code>FNR</code> is equal to one, telling us that this is a new
occurrence of the file and not the one we were reading when the
<code>nextfile</code> function was executed.  In that case, <code>_abandon_</code>
is reset to the empty string, so that further executions of this rule
fail (until the next time that <code>nextfile</code> is called).

   <p>If <code>FNR</code> is not one, then we are still in the original data file
and the program executes a <code>next</code> statement to skip through it.

   <p>An important question to ask at this point is: given that the
functionality of <code>nextfile</code> can be provided with a library file,
why is it built into <span class="command">gawk</span>?  Adding
features for little reason leads to larger, slower programs that are
harder to maintain. 
The answer is that building <code>nextfile</code> into <span class="command">gawk</span> provides
significant gains in efficiency.  If the <code>nextfile</code> function is executed
at the beginning of a large data file, <span class="command">awk</span> still has to scan the entire
file, splitting it up into records,
<!-- at least conceptually -->
just to skip over it.  The built-in
<code>nextfile</code> can simply close the file immediately and proceed to the
next one, which saves a lot of time.  This is particularly important in
<span class="command">awk</span>, because <span class="command">awk</span> programs are generally I/O-bound (i.e.,
they spend most of their time doing input and output, instead of performing
computations).

<h4 class="subsection">12.2.2 Converting Strings To Numbers</h4>

<p>The <code>strtonum</code> function (see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>)
is a <span class="command">gawk</span> extension.  The following function
provides an implementation for other versions of <span class="command">awk</span>:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/strtonum.awk -->
     # strtonum --- convert string to number
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/strtonum.awk -->
     function mystrtonum(str,        ret, chars, n, i, k, c)
     {
         if (str ~ /^0[0-7]*$/) {

             for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
                 c = substr(str, i, 1)
                 if ((k = index("01234567", c)) &gt; 0)
                     k-- # adjust for 1-basing in awk
     
                 ret = ret * 8 + k
             }
         } else if (str ~ /^0[xX][0-9a-fA-f]+/) {
             # hexadecimal
             str = substr(str, 3)    # lop off leading 0x
             n = length(str)
             ret = 0
             for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
                 c = substr(str, i, 1)
                 c = tolower(c)
                 if ((k = index("0123456789", c)) &gt; 0)
                     k-- # adjust for 1-basing in awk
                 else if ((k = index("abcdef", c)) &gt; 0)
                     k += 9
     
                 ret = ret * 16 + k
             }
         } else if (str ~ /^[-+]?([0-9]+([.][0-9]*([Ee][0-9]+)?)?|([.][0-9]+([Ee][-+]?[0-9]+)?))$/) {
             # decimal number, possibly floating point
             ret = str + 0
         } else
             ret = "NOT-A-NUMBER"
     
         return ret
     }
     
     # BEGIN {     # gawk test harness
     #     a[1] = "25"
     #     a[2] = ".31"
     #     a[3] = "0123"
     #     a[4] = "0xdeadBEEF"

     # }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The function first looks for C-style octal numbers (base 8). 
If the input string matches a regular expression describing octal
numbers, then <code>mystrtonum</code> loops through each character in the
string.  It sets <code>k</code> to the index in <code>"01234567"</code> of the current
octal digit.  Since the return value is one-based, the <span class="samp">k--</span>
adjusts <code>k</code> so it can be used in computing the return value.

   <p>Similar logic applies to the code that checks for and converts a
hexadecimal value, which starts with <span class="samp">0x</span> or <span class="samp">0X</span>. 
The use of <code>tolower</code> simplifies the computation for finding
the correct numeric value for each hexadecimal digit.

   <p>Finally, if the string matches the (rather complicated) regex for a
regular decimal integer or floating-point number, the computation
<span class="samp">ret = str + 0</span> lets <span class="command">awk</span> convert the value to a
number.

   <p>A commented-out test program is included, so that the function can
be tested with <span class="command">gawk</span> and the results compared to the built-in
<code>strtonum</code> function.

<h4 class="subsection">12.2.3 Assertions</h4>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE asse -->
<p><a name="index-assertions-1626"></a><!-- STARTOFRANGE assef -->

that a condition or set of conditions is true.  Before proceeding with a
particular computation, you make a statement about what you believe to be
the case.  Such a statement is known as an
<dfn>assertion</dfn>.  The C language provides an <code>&lt;assert.h&gt;</code> header file
and corresponding <code>assert</code> macro that the programmer can use to make
assertions.  If an assertion fails, the <code>assert</code> macro arranges to
print a diagnostic message describing the condition that should have
been true but was not, and then it kills the program.  In C, using
<code>assert</code> looks this:

<pre class="example">     #include &lt;assert.h&gt;
     
     int myfunc(int a, double b)
     {
          assert(a &lt;= 5 &amp;&amp; b &gt;= 17.1);
          ...
     }
</pre>
   <p>If the assertion fails, the program prints a message similar to this:

<pre class="example">     prog.c:5: assertion failed: a &lt;= 5 &amp;&amp; b &gt;= 17.1
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bassert_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1631"></a>The C language makes it possible to turn the condition into a string for use
in printing the diagnostic message.  This is not possible in <span class="command">awk</span>, so
this <code>assert</code> function also requires a string version of the condition
that is being tested. 
Following is the function:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/assert.awk -->
     # assert --- assert that a condition is true. Otherwise exit.
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/assert.awk -->
     function assert(condition, string)
     {
         if (! condition) {
             printf("%s:%d: assertion failed: %s\n",
                 FILENAME, FNR, string) &gt; "/dev/stderr"
             _assert_exit = 1
             exit 1
         }
     }
     
     END {
         if (_assert_exit)
             exit 1
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <code>assert</code> function tests the <code>condition</code> parameter. If it
is false, it prints a message to standard error, using the <code>string</code>
parameter to describe the failed condition.  It then sets the variable
<code>_assert_exit</code> to one and executes the <code>exit</code> statement. 
The <code>exit</code> statement jumps to the <code>END</code> rule. If the <code>END</code>
rules finds <code>_assert_exit</code> to be true, it exits immediately.

   <p>The purpose of the test in the <code>END</code> rule is to
keep any other <code>END</code> rules from running.  When an assertion fails, the
program should exit immediately. 
If no assertions fail, then <code>_assert_exit</code> is still
false when the <code>END</code> rule is run normally, and the rest of the
program's <code>END</code> rules execute. 
For all of this to work correctly, <span class="file">assert.awk</span> must be the
first source file read by <span class="command">awk</span>. 
The function can be used in a program in the following way:

<pre class="example">     function myfunc(a, b)
     {
          assert(a &lt;= 5 &amp;&amp; b &gt;= 17.1, "a &lt;= 5 &amp;&amp; b &gt;= 17.1")
          ...
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the assertion fails, you see a message similar to the following:

<pre class="example">     mydata:1357: assertion failed: a &lt;= 5 &amp;&amp; b &gt;= 17.1
</pre>

An <code>END</code> rule is automatically added
to the program calling <code>assert</code>.  Normally, if a program consists
of just a <code>BEGIN</code> rule, the input files and/or standard input are
not read. However, now that the program has an <code>END</code> rule, <span class="command">awk</span>
attempts to read the input data files or standard input
(see <a href="#Using-BEGIN_002fEND">Using BEGIN/END</a>),
most likely causing the program to hang as it waits for input.

make sure the <code>BEGIN</code> rule always ends
with an <code>exit</code> statement.

(see <a href="#Printf">Printf</a>)
perform rounding often depends upon the system's C <code>sprintf</code>
subroutine.  On many machines, <code>sprintf</code> rounding is &ldquo;unbiased,&rdquo;
which means it doesn't always round a trailing <span class="samp">.5</span> up, contrary
to naive expectations.  In unbiased rounding, <span class="samp">.5</span> rounds to even,
rather than always up, so 1.5 rounds to 2 but 4.5 rounds to 4.  This means
that if you are using a format that does rounding (e.g., <code>"%.0f"</code>),
you should check what your system does.  The following function does
traditional rounding; it might be useful if your awk's <code>printf</code>
does unbiased rounding:

The Cliff random number
generator<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-58" name="fnd-58"><sup>58</sup></a>
is a very simple random number generator that &ldquo;passes the noise sphere test
for randomness by showing no structure.&rdquo;
It is easily programmed, in less than 10 lines of <span class="command">awk</span> code:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bcliff_005frand_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1647"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/cliff_rand.awk -->
     # cliff_rand.awk --- generate Cliff random numbers
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/cliff_rand.awk -->
     BEGIN { _cliff_seed = 0.1 }
     
     function cliff_rand()
     {
         _cliff_seed = (100 * log(_cliff_seed)) % 1
         if (_cliff_seed &lt; 0)
             _cliff_seed = - _cliff_seed
         return _cliff_seed
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>This algorithm requires an initial &ldquo;seed&rdquo; of 0.1.  Each new value
uses the current seed as input for the calculation. 
If the built-in <code>rand</code> function
(see <a href="#Numeric-Functions">Numeric Functions</a>)
isn't random enough, you might try using this function instead.

<code>ord</code>, which takes a character and returns the numeric value for that
character in the machine's character set.  If the string passed to
<code>ord</code> has more than one character, only the first one is used.

   <p>The inverse of this function is <code>chr</code> (from the function of the same
name in Pascal), which takes a number and returns the corresponding character. 
Both functions are written very nicely in <span class="command">awk</span>; there is no real
reason to build them into the <span class="command">awk</span> interpreter:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bord_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1652"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bchr_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1653"></a>

The most prominent character set in use today is ASCII. Although an
8-bit byte can hold 256 distinct values (from 0 to 255), ASCII only
defines characters that use the values from 0 to 127.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-59" name="fnd-59"><sup>59</sup></a>
In the now distant past,
at least one minicomputer manufacturer
<!-- Pr1me, blech -->
used ASCII, but with mark parity, meaning that the leftmost bit in the byte
is always 1.  This means that on those systems, characters
have numeric values from 128 to 255. 
Finally, large mainframe systems use the EBCDIC character set, which
uses all 256 values. 
While there are other character sets in use on some older systems,
they are not really worth worrying about:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/ord.awk -->
     function ord(str,    c)
     {
         # only first character is of interest
         c = substr(str, 1, 1)
         return _ord_[c]
     }
     
     function chr(c)
     {
         # force c to be numeric by adding 0
         return sprintf("%c", c + 0)
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
     
     #### test code ####
     # BEGIN    \
     # {
     #    for (;;) {
     #        printf("enter a character: ")
     #        if (getline var &lt;= 0)
     #            break
     #        printf("ord(%s) = %d\n", var, ord(var))
     #    }
     # }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>An obvious improvement to these functions is to move the code for the
<code>_ord_init<!-- /@w --></code> function into the body of the <code>BEGIN</code> rule.  It was
written this way initially for ease of development. 
There is a &ldquo;test program&rdquo; in a <code>BEGIN</code> rule, to test the
function.  It is commented out for production use.

all the strings in an array into one long string.  The following function,
<code>join</code>, accomplishes this task.  It is used later in several of
the application programs
(see <a href="#Sample-Programs">Sample Programs</a>).

   <p>Good function design is important; this function needs to be general but it
should also have a reasonable default behavior.  It is called with an array
as well as the beginning and ending indices of the elements in the array to be
merged.  This assumes that the array indices are numeric&mdash;a reasonable
assumption since the array was likely created with <code>split</code>
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>):

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bjoin_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1663"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/join.awk -->
     # join.awk --- join an array into a string
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/join.awk -->
     function join(array, start, end, sep,    result, i)
     {
         if (sep == "")
            sep = " "
         else if (sep == SUBSEP) # magic value
            sep = ""
         result = array[start]
         for (i = start + 1; i &lt;= end; i++)
             result = result sep array[i]
         return result
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>An optional additional argument is the separator to use when joining the
strings back together.  If the caller supplies a nonempty value,
<code>join</code> uses it; if it is not supplied, it has a null
value.  In this case, <code>join</code> uses a single blank as a default
separator for the strings.  If the value is equal to <code>SUBSEP</code>,
then <code>join</code> joins the strings with no separator between them. 
<code>SUBSEP</code> serves as a &ldquo;magic&rdquo; value to indicate that there should
be no separation between the component strings.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-60" name="fnd-60"><sup>60</sup></a>

the beginning and end of your <span class="command">awk</span> program, respectively
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>). 
We (the <span class="command">gawk</span> authors) once had a user who mistakenly thought that the
<code>BEGIN</code> rule is executed at the beginning of each data file and the
<code>END</code> rule is executed at the end of each data file.  When informed
that this was not the case, the user requested that we add new special
patterns to <span class="command">gawk</span>, named <code>BEGIN_FILE</code> and <code>END_FILE</code>, that
would have the desired behavior.  He even supplied us the code to do so.

   <p>Adding these special patterns to <span class="command">gawk</span> wasn't necessary;
the job can be done cleanly in <span class="command">awk</span> itself, as illustrated
by the following library program. 
It arranges to call two user-supplied functions, <code>beginfile</code> and
<code>endfile</code>, at the beginning and end of each data file. 
Besides solving the problem in only nine(!) lines of code, it does so
<em>portably</em>; this works with any implementation of <span class="command">awk</span>:

   <p>This file must be loaded before the user's &ldquo;main&rdquo; program, so that the
rule it supplies is executed first.

   <p>This rule relies on <span class="command">awk</span>'s <code>FILENAME</code> variable that
automatically changes for each new data file.  The current file name is
saved in a private variable, <code>_oldfilename</code>.  If <code>FILENAME</code> does
not equal <code>_oldfilename</code>, then a new data file is being processed and
it is necessary to call <code>endfile</code> for the old file.  Because
<code>endfile</code> should only be called if a file has been processed, the
program first checks to make sure that <code>_oldfilename</code> is not the null
string.  The program then assigns the current file name to
<code>_oldfilename</code> and calls <code>beginfile</code> for the file. 
Because, like all <span class="command">awk</span> variables, <code>_oldfilename</code> is
initialized to the null string, this rule executes correctly even for the
first data file.

   <p>The program also supplies an <code>END</code> rule to do the final processing for
the last file.  Because this <code>END</code> rule comes before any <code>END</code> rules
supplied in the &ldquo;main&rdquo; program, <code>endfile</code> is called first.  Once
again the value of multiple <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules should be clear.

(see <a href="#Nextfile-Function">Nextfile Function</a>). 
If the same data file occurs twice in a row on the command line, then
<code>endfile</code> and <code>beginfile</code> are not executed at the end of the
first pass and at the beginning of the second pass. 
The following version solves the problem:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/ftrans.awk -->
     # ftrans.awk --- handle data file transitions
     #
     # user supplies beginfile() and endfile() functions

     <!-- file eg/lib/ftrans.awk -->
     FNR == 1 {
         if (_filename_ != "")
             endfile(_filename_)
         _filename_ = FILENAME
         beginfile(FILENAME)
     }
     
     END  { endfile(_filename_) }
     <!-- endfile -->

<p><a name="index-files_002c-reading-1676"></a>Another request for a new built-in function was for a <code>rewind</code>
function that would make it possible to reread the current file. 
The requesting user didn't want to have to use <code>getline</code>
(see <a href="#Getline">Getline</a>)
inside a loop.

   <p>However, as long as you are not in the <code>END</code> rule, it is
quite easy to arrange to immediately close the current input file
and then start over with it from the top. 
For lack of a better name, we'll call it <code>rewind</code>:

<h4 class="subsection">12.3.4 Checking For Zero-length Files</h4>

<p>All known <span class="command">awk</span> implementations silently skip over zero-length files. 
This is a by-product of <span class="command">awk</span>'s implicit
read-a-record-and-match-against-the-rules loop: when <span class="command">awk</span>
tries to read a record from an empty file, it immediately receives an
end of file indication, closes the file, and proceeds on to the next
command-line data file, <em>without</em> executing any user-level
<span class="command">awk</span> program code.

   <p>Using <span class="command">gawk</span>'s <code>ARGIND</code> variable
(see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>), it is possible to detect when an empty
data file has been skipped.  Similar to the library file presented
in <a href="#Filetrans-Function">Filetrans Function</a>, the following library file calls a function named
<code>zerofile</code> that the user must provide.  The arguments passed are
the file name and the position in <code>ARGV</code> where it was found:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bzerofile_002eawk_007d-program-1683"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/zerofile.awk -->
     # zerofile.awk --- library file to process empty input files
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/zerofile.awk -->
     BEGIN { Argind = 0 }
     
     ARGIND &gt; Argind + 1 {
         for (Argind++; Argind &lt; ARGIND; Argind++)
             zerofile(ARGV[Argind], Argind)
     }
     
     ARGIND != Argind { Argind = ARGIND }
     
     END {
         if (ARGIND &gt; Argind)
             for (Argind++; Argind &lt;= ARGIND; Argind++)
                 zerofile(ARGV[Argind], Argind)
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The user-level variable <code>Argind</code> allows the <span class="command">awk</span> program
to track its progress through <code>ARGV</code>.  Whenever the program detects
that <code>ARGIND</code> is greater than <span class="samp">Argind + 1</span>, it means that one or
more empty files were skipped.  The action then calls <code>zerofile</code> for
each such file, incrementing <code>Argind</code> along the way.

   <p>The <span class="samp">Argind != ARGIND</span> rule simply keeps <code>Argind</code> up to date
in the normal case.

   <p>Finally, the <code>END</code> rule catches the case of any empty files at
the end of the command-line arguments.  Note that the test in the
condition of the <code>for</code> loop uses the <span class="samp">&lt;=</span> operator,
not <code>&lt;</code>.

   <p>As an exercise, you might consider whether this same problem can
be solved without relying on <span class="command">gawk</span>'s <code>ARGIND</code> variable.

   <p>As a second exercise, revise this code to handle the case where
an intervening value in <code>ARGV</code> is a variable assignment.

<h4 class="subsection">12.3.5 Treating Assignments as File Names</h4>

<p><a name="index-assignments-as-filenames-1684"></a><a name="index-filenames_002c-assignments-as-1685"></a>Occasionally, you might not want <span class="command">awk</span> to process command-line
variable assignments
(see <a href="#Assignment-Options">Assignment Options</a>). 
In particular, if you have file names that contain an <span class="samp">=</span> character,
<span class="command">awk</span> treats the file name as an assignment, and does not process it.

   <p>Some users have suggested an additional command-line option for <span class="command">gawk</span>
to disable command-line assignments.  However, some simple programming with
a library file does the trick:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bnoassign_002eawk_007d-program-1686"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/noassign.awk -->
     # noassign.awk --- library file to avoid the need for a
     # special option that disables command-line assignments
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/noassign.awk -->
     function disable_assigns(argc, argv,    i)
     {
         for (i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++)
             if (argv[i] ~ /^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z_0-9]*=.*/)
                 argv[i] = ("./" argv[i])
     }
     
     BEGIN {
         if (No_command_assign)
             disable_assigns(ARGC, ARGV)
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>You then run your program this way:

<pre class="example">     awk -v No_command_assign=1 -f noassign.awk -f yourprog.awk *
</pre>
   <p>The function works by looping through the arguments. 
It prepends <span class="samp">./</span> to
any argument that matches the form
of a variable assignment, turning that argument into a file name.

   <p>The use of <code>No_command_assign</code> allows you to disable command-line
assignments at invocation time, by giving the variable a true value. 
When not set, it is initially zero (i.e., false), so the command-line arguments
are left alone.

<a name="index-functions_002c-library_002c-C-library-1691"></a><a name="index-arguments_002c-processing-1692"></a>Most utilities on POSIX compatible systems take options, or &ldquo;switches,&rdquo; on
the command line that can be used to change the way a program behaves. 
<span class="command">awk</span> is an example of such a program
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>). 
Often, options take <dfn>arguments</dfn>; i.e., data that the program needs to
correctly obey the command-line option.  For example, <span class="command">awk</span>'s
<span class="option">-F</span> option requires a string to use as the field separator. 
The first occurrence on the command line of either <span class="option">--</span> or a
string that does not begin with <span class="samp">-</span> ends the options.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetopt_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1693"></a>Modern Unix systems provide a C function named <code>getopt</code> for processing
command-line arguments.  The programmer provides a string describing the
one-letter options. If an option requires an argument, it is followed in the
string with a colon.  <code>getopt</code> is also passed the
count and values of the command-line arguments and is called in a loop. 
<code>getopt</code> processes the command-line arguments for option letters. 
Each time around the loop, it returns a single character representing the
next option letter that it finds, or <span class="samp">?</span> if it finds an invalid option. 
When it returns &minus;1, there are no options left on the command line.

   <p>When using <code>getopt</code>, options that do not take arguments can be
grouped together.  Furthermore, options that take arguments require that the
argument is present.  The argument can immediately follow the option letter,
or it can be a separate command-line argument.

   <p>Given a hypothetical program that takes
three command-line options, <span class="option">-a</span>, <span class="option">-b</span>, and <span class="option">-c</span>, where
<span class="option">-b</span> requires an argument, all of the following are valid ways of
invoking the program:

<pre class="example">     prog -a -b foo -c data1 data2 data3
     prog -ac -bfoo -- data1 data2 data3
     prog -acbfoo data1 data2 data3
</pre>
   <p>Notice that when the argument is grouped with its option, the rest of
the argument is considered to be the option's argument. 
In this example, <span class="option">-acbfoo</span> indicates that all of the
<span class="option">-a</span>, <span class="option">-b</span>, and <span class="option">-c</span> options were supplied,
and that <span class="samp">foo</span> is the argument to the <span class="option">-b</span> option.

   <p><code>getopt</code> provides four external variables that the programmer can use:

     <dl>
<dt><code>optind</code><dd>The index in the argument value array (<code>argv</code>) where the first
nonoption command-line argument can be found.

     <br><dt><code>optarg</code><dd>The string value of the argument to an option.

     <br><dt><code>opterr</code><dd>Usually <code>getopt</code> prints an error message when it finds an invalid
option.  Setting <code>opterr</code> to zero disables this feature.  (An
application might want to print its own error message.)

     <br><dt><code>optopt</code><dd>The letter representing the command-line option. 
<!-- While not usually documented, most versions supply this variable. -->
</dl>

   <p>The following C fragment shows how <code>getopt</code> might process command-line
arguments for <span class="command">awk</span>:

<pre class="example">     int
     main(int argc, char *argv[])
     {
         ...
         /* print our own message */
         opterr = 0;
         while ((c = getopt(argc, argv, "v:f:F:W:")) != -1) {
             switch (c) {
             case 'f':    /* file */
                 ...
                 break;
             case 'F':    /* field separator */
                 ...
                 break;
             case 'v':    /* variable assignment */
                 ...
                 break;
             case 'W':    /* extension */
                 ...
                 break;
             case '?':
             default:
                 usage();
                 break;
             }
         }
         ...
     }
</pre>
   <p>As a side point, <span class="command">gawk</span> actually uses the GNU <code>getopt_long</code>
function to process both normal and GNU-style long options
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>).

   <p>The abstraction provided by <code>getopt</code> is very useful and is quite
handy in <span class="command">awk</span> programs as well.  Following is an <span class="command">awk</span>
version of <code>getopt</code>.  This function highlights one of the
greatest weaknesses in <span class="command">awk</span>, which is that it is very poor at
manipulating single characters.  Repeated calls to <code>substr</code> are
necessary for accessing individual characters
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>).<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-61" name="fnd-61"><sup>61</sup></a>

   <p>The discussion that follows walks through the code a bit at a time:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetopt_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1694"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/getopt.awk -->
     # getopt.awk --- do C library getopt(3) function in awk
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/getopt.awk -->
     # External variables:
     #    Optind -- index in ARGV of first nonoption argument
     #    Optarg -- string value of argument to current option
     #    Opterr -- if nonzero, print our own diagnostic
     #    Optopt -- current option letter
     
     # Returns:
     #    -1     at end of options
     #    ?      for unrecognized option
     #    &lt;c&gt;    a character representing the current option
     
     # Private Data:
     #    _opti  -- index in multi-flag option, e.g., -abc
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The function starts out with
a list of the global variables it uses,
what the return values are, what they mean, and any global variables that
are &ldquo;private&rdquo; to this library function.  Such documentation is essential
for any program, and particularly for library functions.

   <p>The <code>getopt</code> function first checks that it was indeed called with a string of options
(the <code>options</code> parameter).  If <code>options</code> has a zero length,
<code>getopt</code> immediately returns &minus;1:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetopt_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1695"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/getopt.awk -->
     function getopt(argc, argv, options,    thisopt, i)
     {
         if (length(options) == 0)    # no options given
             return -1
     
         if (argv[Optind] == "--") {  # all done
             Optind++
             _opti = 0
             return -1
         } else if (argv[Optind] !~ /^-[^: \t\n\f\r\v\b]/) {
             _opti = 0
             return -1
         }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The next thing to check for is the end of the options.  A <span class="option">--</span>
ends the command-line options, as does any command-line argument that
does not begin with a <span class="samp">-</span>.  <code>Optind</code> is used to step through
the array of command-line arguments; it retains its value across calls
to <code>getopt</code>, because it is a global variable.

   <p>The regular expression that is used, <code>/^-[^:&nbsp;\t\n\f\r\v\b]/<!-- /@w --></code>, is
perhaps a bit of overkill; it checks for a <span class="samp">-</span> followed by anything
that is not whitespace and not a colon. 
If the current command-line argument does not match this pattern,
it is not an option, and it ends option processing:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/getopt.awk -->
         if (_opti == 0)
             _opti = 2
         thisopt = substr(argv[Optind], _opti, 1)
         Optopt = thisopt
         i = index(options, thisopt)
         if (i == 0) {
             if (Opterr)
                 printf("%c -- invalid option\n",
                                       thisopt) &gt; "/dev/stderr"
             if (_opti &gt;= length(argv[Optind])) {
                 Optind++
                 _opti = 0
             } else
                 _opti++
             return "?"
         }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <code>_opti</code> variable tracks the position in the current command-line
argument (<code>argv[Optind]</code>).  If multiple options are
grouped together with one <span class="samp">-</span> (e.g., <span class="option">-abx</span>), it is necessary
to return them to the user one at a time.

   <p>If <code>_opti</code> is equal to zero, it is set to two, which is the index in
the string of the next character to look at (we skip the <span class="samp">-</span>, which
is at position one).  The variable <code>thisopt</code> holds the character,
obtained with <code>substr</code>.  It is saved in <code>Optopt</code> for the main
program to use.

   <p>If <code>thisopt</code> is not in the <code>options</code> string, then it is an
invalid option.  If <code>Opterr</code> is nonzero, <code>getopt</code> prints an error
message on the standard error that is similar to the message from the C
version of <code>getopt</code>.

   <p>Because the option is invalid, it is necessary to skip it and move on to the
next option character.  If <code>_opti</code> is greater than or equal to the
length of the current command-line argument, it is necessary to move on
to the next argument, so <code>Optind</code> is incremented and <code>_opti</code> is reset
to zero. Otherwise, <code>Optind</code> is left alone and <code>_opti</code> is merely
incremented.

   <p>In any case, because the option is invalid, <code>getopt</code> returns <span class="samp">?</span>. 
The main program can examine <code>Optopt</code> if it needs to know what the
invalid option letter actually is. Continuing on:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/getopt.awk -->
         if (substr(options, i + 1, 1) == ":") {
             # get option argument
             if (length(substr(argv[Optind], _opti + 1)) &gt; 0)
                 Optarg = substr(argv[Optind], _opti + 1)
             else
                 Optarg = argv[++Optind]
             _opti = 0
         } else
             Optarg = ""
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>If the option requires an argument, the option letter is followed by a colon
in the <code>options</code> string.  If there are remaining characters in the
current command-line argument (<code>argv[Optind]</code>), then the rest of that
string is assigned to <code>Optarg</code>.  Otherwise, the next command-line
argument is used (<span class="samp">-xFOO</span> versus <span class="samp">-x&nbsp;FOO<!-- /@w --></span>). In either case,
<code>_opti</code> is reset to zero, because there are no more characters left to
examine in the current command-line argument. Continuing:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/getopt.awk -->
         if (_opti == 0 || _opti &gt;= length(argv[Optind])) {
             Optind++
             _opti = 0
         } else
             _opti++
         return thisopt
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>Finally, if <code>_opti</code> is either zero or greater than the length of the
current command-line argument, it means this element in <code>argv</code> is
through being processed, so <code>Optind</code> is incremented to point to the
next element in <code>argv</code>.  If neither condition is true, then only
<code>_opti</code> is incremented, so that the next option letter can be processed
on the next call to <code>getopt</code>.

   <p>The <code>BEGIN</code> rule initializes both <code>Opterr</code> and <code>Optind</code> to one. 
<code>Opterr</code> is set to one, since the default behavior is for <code>getopt</code>
to print a diagnostic message upon seeing an invalid option.  <code>Optind</code>
is set to one, since there's no reason to look at the program name, which is
in <code>ARGV[0]</code>:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/getopt.awk -->
     BEGIN {
         Opterr = 1    # default is to diagnose
         Optind = 1    # skip ARGV[0]
     
         # test program
         if (_getopt_test) {
             while ((_go_c = getopt(ARGC, ARGV, "ab:cd")) != -1)
                 printf("c = &lt;%c&gt;, optarg = &lt;%s&gt;\n",
                                            _go_c, Optarg)
             printf("non-option arguments:\n")
             for (; Optind &lt; ARGC; Optind++)
                 printf("\tARGV[%d] = &lt;%s&gt;\n",
                                         Optind, ARGV[Optind])
         }
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The rest of the <code>BEGIN</code> rule is a simple test program.  Here is the
result of two sample runs of the test program:

<pre class="example">     $ awk -f getopt.awk -v _getopt_test=1 -- -a -cbARG bax -x
     -| c = &lt;a&gt;, optarg = &lt;&gt;
     -| c = &lt;c&gt;, optarg = &lt;&gt;
     -| c = &lt;b&gt;, optarg = &lt;ARG&gt;
     -| non-option arguments:
     -|         ARGV[3] = &lt;bax&gt;
     -|         ARGV[4] = &lt;-x&gt;
     
     $ awk -f getopt.awk -v _getopt_test=1 -- -a -x -- xyz abc
     -| c = &lt;a&gt;, optarg = &lt;&gt;
     error--&gt; x -- invalid option
     -| c = &lt;?&gt;, optarg = &lt;&gt;
     -| non-option arguments:
     -|         ARGV[4] = &lt;xyz&gt;
     -|         ARGV[5] = &lt;abc&gt;
</pre>
   <p>In both runs,
the first <span class="option">--</span> terminates the arguments to <span class="command">awk</span>, so that it does
not try to interpret the <span class="option">-a</span>, etc., as its own options.

   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> After <code>getopt</code> is through, it is the responsibility of the user level
code to
clear out all the elements of <code>ARGV</code> from 1 to <code>Optind</code>,
so that <span class="command">awk</span> does not try to process the command-line options
as file names. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Several of the sample programs presented in
<a href="#Sample-Programs">Sample Programs</a>,
use <code>getopt</code> to process their arguments.

(see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>)
provides access to the current user's real and effective user and group ID
numbers, and if available, the user's supplementary group set. 
However, because these are numbers, they do not provide very useful
information to the average user.  There needs to be some way to find the
user information associated with the user and group ID numbers.  This
section presents a suite of functions for retrieving information from the
user database.  See <a href="#Group-Functions">Group Functions</a>,
for a similar suite that retrieves information from the group database.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetpwent_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1701"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetpwent_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1702"></a><a name="index-users_002c-information-about_002c-retrieving-1703"></a><a name="index-login-information-1704"></a><a name="index-account-information-1705"></a><a name="index-password-file-1706"></a><a name="index-files_002c-password-1707"></a>The POSIX standard does not define the file where user information is
kept.  Instead, it provides the <code>&lt;pwd.h&gt;</code> header file
and several C language subroutines for obtaining user information. 
The primary function is <code>getpwent</code>, for &ldquo;get password entry.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;password&rdquo; comes from the original user database file,
<span class="file">/etc/passwd</span>, which stores user information, along with the
encrypted passwords (hence the name).

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bpwcat_007d-program-1708"></a>While an <span class="command">awk</span> program could simply read <span class="file">/etc/passwd</span>
directly, this file may not contain complete information about the
system's set of users.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-62" name="fnd-62"><sup>62</sup></a> To be sure you are able to
produce a readable and complete version of the user database, it is necessary
to write a small C program that calls <code>getpwent</code>.  <code>getpwent</code>
is defined as returning a pointer to a <code>struct passwd</code>.  Each time it
is called, it returns the next entry in the database.  When there are
no more entries, it returns <code>NULL</code>, the null pointer.  When this
happens, the C program should call <code>endpwent</code> to close the database. 
Following is <span class="command">pwcat</span>, a C program that &ldquo;cats&rdquo; the password database:

<!-- Use old style function header for portability to old systems (SunOS, HP/UX). -->
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/pwcat.c -->
     /*

      */
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/pwcat.c -->
     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;
     
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/pwcat.c -->
     int
     main(argc, argv)
     int argc;
     char **argv;
     {
         struct passwd *p;
     
         while ((p = getpwent()) != NULL)
             printf("%s:%s:%ld:%ld:%s:%s:%s\n",
                 p-&gt;pw_name, p-&gt;pw_passwd, (long) p-&gt;pw_uid,
                 (long) p-&gt;pw_gid, p-&gt;pw_gecos, p-&gt;pw_dir, p-&gt;pw_shell);
     
         endpwent();
         return 0;
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>If you don't understand C, don't worry about it. 
The output from <span class="command">pwcat</span> is the user database, in the traditional
<span class="file">/etc/passwd</span> format of colon-separated fields.  The fields are:

   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><td valign="top">Login name </td><td valign="top">The user's login name.

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">Encrypted password </td><td valign="top">The user's encrypted password.  This may not be available on some systems.

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">User-ID </td><td valign="top">The user's numeric user ID number.

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">Group-ID </td><td valign="top">The user's numeric group ID number.

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">Full name </td><td valign="top">The user's full name, and perhaps other information associated with the
user.

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">Home directory </td><td valign="top">The user's login (or &ldquo;home&rdquo;) directory (familiar to shell programmers as
<code>$HOME</code>).

shell, such as <span class="command">bash</span>.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern_002c-_0040code_007bpwcat_007d-program-1713"></a>The <code>BEGIN</code> rule sets a private variable to the directory where
<span class="command">pwcat</span> is stored.  Because it is used to help out an <span class="command">awk</span> library
routine, we have chosen to put it in <span class="file">/usr/local/libexec/awk</span>;
however, you might want it to be in a different directory on your system.

   <p>The function <code>_pw_init</code> keeps three copies of the user information
in three associative arrays.  The arrays are indexed by username
(<code>_pw_byname</code>), by user ID number (<code>_pw_byuid</code>), and by order of
occurrence (<code>_pw_bycount</code>). 
The variable <code>_pw_inited</code> is used for efficiency; <code>_pw_init</code>
needs only to be called once.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetline_007d-command_002c-_0040code_007b_005fpw_005finit_007d-function-1714"></a>Because this function uses <code>getline</code> to read information from
<span class="command">pwcat</span>, it first saves the values of <code>FS</code>, <code>RS</code>, and <code>$0</code>. 
It notes in the variable <code>using_fw</code> whether field splitting
with <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code> is in effect or not. 
Doing so is necessary, since these functions could be called
from anywhere within a user's program, and the user may have his
or her
own way of splitting records and fields.

   <p>The <code>using_fw</code> variable checks <code>PROCINFO["FS"]</code>, which
is <code>"FIELDWIDTHS"</code> if field splitting is being done with
<code>FIELDWIDTHS</code>.  This makes it possible to restore the correct
field-splitting mechanism later.  The test can only be true for
<span class="command">gawk</span>.  It is false if using <code>FS</code> or on some other
<span class="command">awk</span> implementation.

   <p>The main part of the function uses a loop to read database lines, split
the line into fields, and then store the line into each array as necessary. 
When the loop is done, <code>_pw_init<!-- /@w --></code> cleans up by closing the pipeline,
setting <code>_pw_inited<!-- /@w --></code> to one, and restoring <code>FS</code> (and <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code>
if necessary), <code>RS</code>, and <code>$0</code>. 
The use of <code>_pw_count<!-- /@w --></code> is explained shortly.

<!-- NEXT ED: All of these functions don't need the ... in ... test.  Just -->
<!-- return the array element, which will be "" if not already there.  Duh. -->
<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetpwnam_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1715"></a>The <code>getpwnam</code> function takes a username as a string argument. If that
user is in the database, it returns the appropriate line. Otherwise, it
returns the null string:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetpwnam_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1716"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/passwdawk.in -->
     function getpwnam(name)
     {
         _pw_init()
         if (name in _pw_byname)
             return _pw_byname[name]
         return ""
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetpwuid_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1717"></a>Similarly,
the <code>getpwuid</code> function takes a user ID number argument. If that
user number is in the database, it returns the appropriate line. Otherwise, it
returns the null string:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetpwuid_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1718"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/passwdawk.in -->
     function getpwuid(uid)
     {
         _pw_init()
         if (uid in _pw_byuid)
             return _pw_byuid[uid]
         return ""
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetpwent_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1719"></a>The <code>getpwent</code> function simply steps through the database, one entry at
a time.  It uses <code>_pw_count</code> to track its current position in the
<code>_pw_bycount</code> array:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetpwent_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1720"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/passwdawk.in -->
     function getpwent()
     {
         _pw_init()
         if (_pw_count &lt; _pw_total)
             return _pw_bycount[++_pw_count]
         return ""
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bendpwent_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1721"></a>The <code>endpwent<!-- /@w --></code> function resets <code>_pw_count<!-- /@w --></code> to zero, so that
subsequent calls to <code>getpwent</code> start over again:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bendpwent_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1722"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/passwdawk.in -->
     function endpwent()
     {
         _pw_count = 0
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>A conscious design decision in this suite was made that each subroutine calls
<code>_pw_init<!-- /@w --></code> to initialize the database arrays.  The overhead of running
a separate process to generate the user database, and the I/O to scan it,
are only incurred if the user's main program actually calls one of these
functions.  If this library file is loaded along with a user's program, but
none of the routines are ever called, then there is no extra runtime overhead. 
(The alternative is move the body of <code>_pw_init<!-- /@w --></code> into a
<code>BEGIN</code> rule, which always runs <span class="command">pwcat</span>.  This simplifies the
code but runs an extra process that may never be needed.)

   <p>In turn, calling <code>_pw_init</code> is not too expensive, because the
<code>_pw_inited</code> variable keeps the program from reading the data more than
once.  If you are worried about squeezing every last cycle out of your
<span class="command">awk</span> program, the check of <code>_pw_inited</code> could be moved out of
<code>_pw_init</code> and duplicated in all the other functions.  In practice,
this is not necessary, since most <span class="command">awk</span> programs are I/O-bound, and it
clutters up the code.

   <p>The <span class="command">id</span> program in <a href="#Id-Program">Id Program</a>,
uses these functions.

<a href="#Passwd-Functions">Passwd Functions</a>,
applies to the group database as well.  Although there has traditionally
been a well-known file (<span class="file">/etc/group</span>) in a well-known format, the POSIX
standard only provides a set of C library routines
(<code>&lt;grp.h&gt;</code> and <code>getgrent</code>)
for accessing the information. 
Even though this file may exist, it likely does not have
complete information.  Therefore, as with the user database, it is necessary
to have a small C program that generates the group database as its output.

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgrcat_007d-program-1734"></a><span class="command">grcat</span>, a C program that &ldquo;cats&rdquo; the group database,
is as follows:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/grcat.c -->
     /*
      * grcat.c
      *
      * Generate a printable version of the group database
      */
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/grcat.c -->
     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     #include &lt;grp.h&gt;
     
     int
     main(argc, argv)
     int argc;
     char **argv;
     {
         struct group *g;
         int i;
     
         while ((g = getgrent()) != NULL) {
             printf("%s:%s:%ld:", g-&gt;gr_name, g-&gt;gr_passwd,
                                          (long) g-&gt;gr_gid);
             for (i = 0; g-&gt;gr_mem[i] != NULL; i++) {
                 printf("%s", g-&gt;gr_mem[i]);
                 if (g-&gt;gr_mem[i+1] != NULL)
                     putchar(',');
             }
             putchar('\n');
         }
         endgrent();
         return 0;
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>Each line in the group database represents one group.  The fields are
separated with colons and represent the following information:

   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><td valign="top">Group name </td><td valign="top">The group's name.

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">Group password </td><td valign="top">The group's encrypted password. In practice, this field is never used;
it is usually empty or set to <span class="samp">*</span>.

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">Group-ID </td><td valign="top">
The group's numeric group ID number; this number should be unique within the file.

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">Group member list </td><td valign="top">
A comma-separated list of user names.  These users are members of the group. 
Modern Unix systems allow users to be members of several groups
simultaneously.  If your system does, then there are elements
<code>"group1"</code> through <code>"group</code><var>N</var><code>"</code> in <code>PROCINFO</code>
for those group ID numbers. 
(Note that <code>PROCINFO</code> is a <span class="command">gawk</span> extension;
see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>.)
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p>Here is what running <span class="command">grcat</span> might produce:

   <p>Here are the functions for obtaining information from the group database.

     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <code>BEGIN</code> rule sets a private variable to the directory where
<span class="command">grcat</span> is stored.  Because it is used to help out an <span class="command">awk</span> library
routine, we have chosen to put it in <span class="file">/usr/local/libexec/awk</span>.  You might
want it to be in a different directory on your system.

   <p>These routines follow the same general outline as the user database routines
(see <a href="#Passwd-Functions">Passwd Functions</a>). 
The <code>_gr_inited<!-- /@w --></code> variable is used to
ensure that the database is scanned no more than once. 
The <code>_gr_init<!-- /@w --></code> function first saves <code>FS</code>, <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code>, <code>RS</code>, and
<code>$0</code>, and then sets <code>FS</code> and <code>RS</code> to the correct values for
scanning the group information.

   <p>The group information is stored is several associative arrays. 
The arrays are indexed by group name (<code>_gr_byname<!-- /@w --></code>), by group ID number
(<code>_gr_bygid<!-- /@w --></code>), and by position in the database (<code>_gr_bycount<!-- /@w --></code>). 
There is an additional array indexed by user name (<code>_gr_groupsbyuser<!-- /@w --></code>),
which is a space-separated list of groups to which each user belongs.

   <p>Unlike the user database, it is possible to have multiple records in the
database for the same group.  This is common when a group has a large number
of members.  A pair of such entries might look like the following:

<pre class="example">     tvpeople:*:101:johnny,jay,arsenio
     tvpeople:*:101:david,conan,tom,joan
</pre>
   <p>For this reason, <code>_gr_init</code> looks to see if a group name or
group ID number is already seen.  If it is, then the user names are
simply concatenated onto the previous list of users.  (There is actually a
subtle problem with the code just presented.  Suppose that
the first time there were no names. This code adds the names with
a leading comma. It also doesn't check that there is a <code>$4</code>.)

   <p>Finally, <code>_gr_init</code> closes the pipeline to <span class="command">grcat</span>, restores
<code>FS</code> (and <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code> if necessary), <code>RS</code>, and <code>$0</code>,
initializes <code>_gr_count</code> to zero
(it is used later), and makes <code>_gr_inited</code> nonzero.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetgrnam_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1737"></a>The <code>getgrnam</code> function takes a group name as its argument, and if that
group exists, it is returned. Otherwise, <code>getgrnam</code> returns the null
string:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetgrnam_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1738"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/groupawk.in -->
     function getgrnam(group)
     {
         _gr_init()
         if (group in _gr_byname)
             return _gr_byname[group]
         return ""
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetgrgid_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1739"></a>The <code>getgrgid</code> function is similar, it takes a numeric group ID and
looks up the information associated with that group ID:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetgrgid_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1740"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/groupawk.in -->
     function getgrgid(gid)
     {
         _gr_init()
         if (gid in _gr_bygid)
             return _gr_bygid[gid]
         return ""
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetgruser_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1741"></a>The <code>getgruser</code> function does not have a C counterpart. It takes a
user name and returns the list of groups that have the user as a member:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetgruser_007d-function_002c-user_002ddefined-1742"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/groupawk.in -->
     function getgruser(user)
     {
         _gr_init()
         if (user in _gr_groupsbyuser)
             return _gr_groupsbyuser[user]
         return ""
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetgrent_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1743"></a>The <code>getgrent</code> function steps through the database one entry at a time. 
It uses <code>_gr_count</code> to track its position in the list:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgetgrent_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1744"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/groupawk.in -->
     function getgrent()
     {
         _gr_init()
         if (++_gr_count in _gr_bycount)
             return _gr_bycount[_gr_count]
         return ""
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <!-- ENDOFRANGE clibf -->
<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bendgrent_007d-function-_0028C-library_0029-1745"></a>The <code>endgrent</code> function resets <code>_gr_count</code> to zero so that <code>getgrent</code> can
start over again:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bendgrent_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1746"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/groupawk.in -->
     function endgrent()
     {
         _gr_count = 0
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>As with the user database routines, each function calls <code>_gr_init</code> to
initialize the arrays.  Doing so only incurs the extra overhead of running
<span class="command">grcat</span> if these functions are used (as opposed to moving the body of
<code>_gr_init</code> into a <code>BEGIN</code> rule).

   <p>Most of the work is in scanning the database and building the various
associative arrays.  The functions that the user calls are themselves very
simple, relying on <span class="command">awk</span>'s associative arrays to do work.

   <p>The <span class="command">id</span> program in <a href="#Id-Program">Id Program</a>,
uses these functions.

<p><a name="index-_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-examples-of-1747"></a>
<a href="#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>,
presents the idea that reading programs in a language contributes to
learning that language.  This chapter continues that theme,
presenting a potpourri of <span class="command">awk</span> programs for your reading
enjoyment. 
There are three sections. 
The first describes how to run the programs presented
in this chapter.

   <p>The second presents <span class="command">awk</span>
versions of several common POSIX utilities. 
These are programs that you are hopefully already familiar with,
and therefore, whose problems are understood. 
By reimplementing these programs in <span class="command">awk</span>,
you can focus on the <span class="command">awk</span>-related aspects of solving
the programming problem.

   <p>The third is a grab bag of interesting programs. 
These solve a number of different data-manipulation and management
problems.  Many of the programs are short, which emphasizes <span class="command">awk</span>'s
ability to do a lot in just a few lines of code.

   <p>Many of these programs use the library functions presented in
<a href="#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>.

<h3 class="section">13.1 Running the Example Programs</h3>

<p>To run a given program, you would typically do something like this:

<pre class="example">     awk -f <var>program</var> -- <var>options</var> <var>files</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, <var>program</var> is the name of the <span class="command">awk</span> program (such as
<span class="file">cut.awk</span>), <var>options</var> are any command-line options for the
program that start with a <span class="samp">-</span>, and <var>files</var> are the actual data files.

   <p>If your system supports the <span class="samp">#!</span> executable interpreter mechanism
(see <a href="#Executable-Scripts">Executable Scripts</a>),
you can instead run your program directly:

<pre class="example">     cut.awk -c1-8 myfiles &gt; results
</pre>
   <p>If your <span class="command">awk</span> is not <span class="command">gawk</span>, you may instead need to use this:

This section presents a number of POSIX utilities that are implemented in
<span class="command">awk</span>.  Reinventing these programs in <span class="command">awk</span> is often enjoyable,
because the algorithms can be very clearly expressed, and the code is usually
very concise and simple.  This is true because <span class="command">awk</span> does so much for you.

   <p>It should be noted that these programs are not necessarily intended to
replace the installed versions on your system.  Instead, their
purpose is to illustrate <span class="command">awk</span> language programming for &ldquo;real world&rdquo;
tasks.

<a name="index-fields_002c-cutting-1751"></a><!-- STARTOFRANGE colcut -->
<a name="index-columns_002c-cutting-1752"></a>The <span class="command">cut</span> utility selects, or &ldquo;cuts,&rdquo; characters or fields
from its standard input and sends them to its standard output. 
Fields are separated by tabs by default,
but you may supply a command-line option to change the field
<dfn>delimiter</dfn> (i.e., the field-separator character). <span class="command">cut</span>'s
definition of fields is less general than <span class="command">awk</span>'s.

   <p>A common use of <span class="command">cut</span> might be to pull out just the login name of
logged-on users from the output of <span class="command">who</span>.  For example, the following
pipeline generates a sorted, unique list of the logged-on users:

<pre class="example">     who | cut -c1-8 | sort | uniq
</pre>
   <p>The options for <span class="command">cut</span> are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-c </code><var>list</var><dd>Use <var>list</var> as the list of characters to cut out.  Items within the list
may be separated by commas, and ranges of characters can be separated with
dashes.  The list <span class="samp">1-8,15,22-35</span> specifies characters 1 through
8, 15, and 22 through 35.

     <br><dt><code>-f </code><var>list</var><dd>Use <var>list</var> as the list of fields to cut out.

     <br><dt><code>-d </code><var>delim</var><dd>Use <var>delim</var> as the field-separator character instead of the tab
character.

     <br><dt><code>-s</code><dd>Suppress printing of lines that do not contain the field delimiter. 
</dl>

   <p>The <span class="command">awk</span> implementation of <span class="command">cut</span> uses the <code>getopt</code> library
function (see <a href="#Getopt-Function">Getopt Function</a>)
and the <code>join</code> library function
(see <a href="#Join-Function">Join Function</a>).

   <p>The program begins with a comment describing the options, the library
functions needed, and a <code>usage</code> function that prints out a usage
message and exits.  <code>usage</code> is called if invalid arguments are
supplied:

It sets <code>FS</code> to a single TAB character, because that is <span class="command">cut</span>'s
default field separator.  The output field separator is also set to be the
same as the input field separator.  Then <code>getopt</code> is used to step
through the command-line options.  Exactly one of the variables
<code>by_fields</code> or <code>by_chars</code> is set to true, to indicate that
processing should be done by fields or by characters, respectively. 
When cutting by characters, the output field separator is set to the null
string:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/cut.awk -->
     BEGIN    \
     {
         FS = "\t"    # default
         OFS = FS
         while ((c = getopt(ARGC, ARGV, "sf:c:d:")) != -1) {
             if (c == "f") {
                 by_fields = 1
                 fieldlist = Optarg
             } else if (c == "c") {
                 by_chars = 1
                 fieldlist = Optarg
                 OFS = ""
             } else if (c == "d") {
                 if (length(Optarg) &gt; 1) {
                     printf("Using first character of %s" \
                     " for delimiter\n", Optarg) &gt; "/dev/stderr"
                     Optarg = substr(Optarg, 1, 1)
                 }
                 FS = Optarg
                 OFS = FS
                 if (FS == " ")    # defeat awk semantics
                     FS = "[ ]"
             } else if (c == "s")
                 suppress++
             else
                 usage()
         }
     
         for (i = 1; i &lt; Optind; i++)
             ARGV[i] = ""
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-field-separators_002c-spaces-as-1756"></a>Special care is taken when the field delimiter is a space.  Using
a single space (<code>"&nbsp;"<!-- /@w --></code>) for the value of <code>FS</code> is
incorrect&mdash;<span class="command">awk</span> would separate fields with runs of spaces,
tabs, and/or newlines, and we want them to be separated with individual
spaces.  Also remember that after <code>getopt</code> is through
(as described in <a href="#Getopt-Function">Getopt Function</a>),
we have to
clear out all the elements of <code>ARGV</code> from 1 to <code>Optind</code>,
so that <span class="command">awk</span> does not try to process the command-line options
as file names.

   <p>After dealing with the command-line options, the program verifies that the
options make sense.  Only one or the other of <span class="option">-c</span> and <span class="option">-f</span>
should be used, and both require a field list.  Then the program calls
either <code>set_fieldlist</code> or <code>set_charlist</code> to pull apart the
list of fields or characters:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/cut.awk -->
         if (by_fields &amp;&amp; by_chars)
             usage()
     
         if (by_fields == 0 &amp;&amp; by_chars == 0)
             by_fields = 1    # default
     
         if (fieldlist == "") {
             print "cut: needs list for -c or -f" &gt; "/dev/stderr"
             exit 1
         }
     
         if (by_fields)
             set_fieldlist()
         else
             set_charlist()
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p><code>set_fieldlist</code>  is used to split the field list apart at the commas
and into an array.  Then, for each element of the array, it looks to
see if it is actually a range, and if so, splits it apart. The range
is verified to make sure the first number is smaller than the second. 
Each number in the list is added to the <code>flist</code> array, which
simply lists the fields that will be printed.  Normal field splitting
is used.  The program lets <span class="command">awk</span> handle the job of doing the
field splitting:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/cut.awk -->
     function set_fieldlist(        n, m, i, j, k, f, g)
     {
         n = split(fieldlist, f, ",")
         j = 1    # index in flist
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
             if (index(f[i], "-") != 0) { # a range
                 m = split(f[i], g, "-")
                 if (m != 2 || g[1] &gt;= g[2]) {
                     printf("bad field list: %s\n",
                                       f[i]) &gt; "/dev/stderr"
                     exit 1
                 }
                 for (k = g[1]; k &lt;= g[2]; k++)
                     flist[j++] = k
             } else
                 flist[j++] = f[i]
         }
         nfields = j - 1
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <code>set_charlist</code> function is more complicated than <code>set_fieldlist</code>. 
The idea here is to use <span class="command">gawk</span>'s <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code> variable
(see <a href="#Constant-Size">Constant Size</a>),
which describes constant-width input.  When using a character list, that is
exactly what we have.

   <p>Setting up <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code> is more complicated than simply listing the
fields that need to be printed.  We have to keep track of the fields to
print and also the intervening characters that have to be skipped. 
For example, suppose you wanted characters 1 through 8, 15, and
22 through 35.  You would use <span class="samp">-c 1-8,15,22-35</span>.  The necessary value
for <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code> is <code>"8&nbsp;6&nbsp;1&nbsp;6&nbsp;14"<!-- /@w --></code>.  This yields five
fields, and the fields to print
are <code>$1</code>, <code>$3</code>, and <code>$5</code>. 
The intermediate fields are <dfn>filler</dfn>,
which is stuff in between the desired data. 
<code>flist</code> lists the fields to print, and <code>t</code> tracks the
complete field list, including filler fields:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/cut.awk -->
     function set_charlist(    field, i, j, f, g, t,
                               filler, last, len)
     {
         field = 1   # count total fields
         n = split(fieldlist, f, ",")
         j = 1       # index in flist
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
             if (index(f[i], "-") != 0) { # range
                 m = split(f[i], g, "-")
                 if (m != 2 || g[1] &gt;= g[2]) {
                     printf("bad character list: %s\n",
                                    f[i]) &gt; "/dev/stderr"
                     exit 1
                 }
                 len = g[2] - g[1] + 1
                 if (g[1] &gt; 1)  # compute length of filler
                     filler = g[1] - last - 1
                 else
                     filler = 0
                 if (filler)
                     t[field++] = filler
                 t[field++] = len  # length of field
                 last = g[2]
                 flist[j++] = field - 1
             } else {
                 if (f[i] &gt; 1)
                     filler = f[i] - last - 1
                 else
                     filler = 0
                 if (filler)
                     t[field++] = filler
                 t[field++] = 1
                 last = f[i]
                 flist[j++] = field - 1
             }
         }
         FIELDWIDTHS = join(t, 1, field - 1)
         nfields = j - 1
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>Next is the rule that actually processes the data.  If the <span class="option">-s</span> option
is given, then <code>suppress</code> is true.  The first <code>if</code> statement
makes sure that the input record does have the field separator.  If
<span class="command">cut</span> is processing fields, <code>suppress</code> is true, and the field
separator character is not in the record, then the record is skipped.

   <p>If the record is valid, then <span class="command">gawk</span> has split the data
into fields, either using the character in <code>FS</code> or using fixed-length
fields and <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code>.  The loop goes through the list of fields
that should be printed.  The corresponding field is printed if it contains data. 
If the next field also has data, then the separator character is
written out between the fields:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/cut.awk -->
     {
         if (by_fields &amp;&amp; suppress &amp;&amp; index($0, FS) != 0)
             next
     
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= nfields; i++) {
             if ($flist[i] != "") {
                 printf "%s", $flist[i]
                 if (i &lt; nfields &amp;&amp; $flist[i+1] != "")
                     printf "%s", OFS
             }
         }
         print ""
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>This version of <span class="command">cut</span> relies on <span class="command">gawk</span>'s <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code>
variable to do the character-based cutting.  While it is possible in
other <span class="command">awk</span> implementations to use <code>substr</code>
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>),
it is also extremely painful. 
The <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code> variable supplies an elegant solution to the problem
of picking the input line apart by characters.

<a name="index-files_002c-searching-for-regular-expressions-1759"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007begrep_007d-utility-1760"></a>The <span class="command">egrep</span> utility searches files for patterns.  It uses regular
expressions that are almost identical to those available in <span class="command">awk</span>
(see <a href="#Regexp">Regexp</a>). 
It is used in the following manner:

<pre class="example">     egrep <span class="roman">[</span> <var>options</var> <span class="roman">]</span> '<var>pattern</var>' <var>files</var> ...
</pre>
   <p>The <var>pattern</var> is a regular expression.  In typical usage, the regular
expression is quoted to prevent the shell from expanding any of the
special characters as file name wildcards.  Normally, <span class="command">egrep</span>
prints the lines that matched.  If multiple file names are provided on
the command line, each output line is preceded by the name of the file
and a colon.

   <p>The options to <span class="command">egrep</span> are as follows:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-c</code><dd>Print out a count of the lines that matched the pattern, instead of the
lines themselves.

     <br><dt><code>-s</code><dd>Be silent.  No output is produced and the exit value indicates whether
the pattern was matched.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dd>Invert the sense of the test. <span class="command">egrep</span> prints the lines that do
<em>not</em> match the pattern and exits successfully if the pattern is not
matched.

     <br><dt><code>-i</code><dd>Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the input data.

     <br><dt><code>-l</code><dd>Only print (list) the names of the files that matched, not the lines that matched.

     <br><dt><code>-e </code><var>pattern</var><dd>Use <var>pattern</var> as the regexp to match.  The purpose of the <span class="option">-e</span>
option is to allow patterns that start with a <span class="samp">-</span>. 
</dl>

   <p>This version uses the <code>getopt</code> library function
(see <a href="#Getopt-Function">Getopt Function</a>)
and the file transition library program
(see <a href="#Filetrans-Function">Filetrans Function</a>).

   <p>The program begins with a descriptive comment and then a <code>BEGIN</code> rule
that processes the command-line arguments with <code>getopt</code>.  The <span class="option">-i</span>
(ignore case) option is particularly easy with <span class="command">gawk</span>; we just use the
<code>IGNORECASE</code> built-in variable
(see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>):

     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>Next comes the code that handles the <span class="command">egrep</span>-specific behavior. If no
pattern is supplied with <span class="option">-e</span>, the first nonoption on the
command line is used.  The <span class="command">awk</span> command-line arguments up to <code>ARGV[Optind]</code>
are cleared, so that <span class="command">awk</span> won't try to process them as files.  If no
files are specified, the standard input is used, and if multiple files are
specified, we make sure to note this so that the file names can precede the
matched lines in the output:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/egrep.awk -->
         if (pattern == "")
             pattern = ARGV[Optind++]
     
         for (i = 1; i &lt; Optind; i++)
             ARGV[i] = ""
         if (Optind &gt;= ARGC) {
             ARGV[1] = "-"
             ARGC = 2
         } else if (ARGC - Optind &gt; 1)
             do_filenames++
     
     #    if (IGNORECASE)
     #        pattern = tolower(pattern)
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The last two lines are commented out, since they are not needed in
<span class="command">gawk</span>.  They should be uncommented if you have to use another version
of <span class="command">awk</span>.

   <p>The next set of lines should be uncommented if you are not using
<span class="command">gawk</span>.  This rule translates all the characters in the input line
into lowercase if the <span class="option">-i</span> option is specified.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-63" name="fnd-63"><sup>63</sup></a>
The rule is
commented out since it is not necessary with <span class="command">gawk</span>:

<!-- Exercise: Fix this, w/array and new line as key to original line -->
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/egrep.awk -->
     #{
     #    if (IGNORECASE)
     #        $0 = tolower($0)
     #}
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <code>beginfile</code> function is called by the rule in <span class="file">ftrans.awk</span>
when each new file is processed.  In this case, it is very simple; all it
does is initialize a variable <code>fcount</code> to zero. <code>fcount</code> tracks
how many lines in the current file matched the pattern
(naming the parameter <code>junk</code> shows we know that <code>beginfile</code>
is called with a parameter, but that we're not interested in its value):

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/egrep.awk -->
     function beginfile(junk)
     {
         fcount = 0
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <code>endfile</code> function is called after each file has been processed. 
It affects the output only when the user wants a count of the number of lines that
matched.  <code>no_print</code> is true only if the exit status is desired. 
<code>count_only</code> is true if line counts are desired.  <span class="command">egrep</span>
therefore only prints line counts if printing and counting are enabled. 
The output format must be adjusted depending upon the number of files to
process.  Finally, <code>fcount</code> is added to <code>total</code>, so that we
know the total number of lines that matched the pattern:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/egrep.awk -->
     function endfile(file)
     {
         if (! no_print &amp;&amp; count_only)
             if (do_filenames)
                 print file ":" fcount
             else
                 print fcount
     
         total += fcount
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The following rule does most of the work of matching lines. The variable
<code>matches</code> is true if the line matched the pattern. If the user
wants lines that did not match, the sense of <code>matches</code> is inverted
using the <span class="samp">!</span> operator. <code>fcount</code> is incremented with the value of
<code>matches</code>, which is either one or zero, depending upon a
successful or unsuccessful match.  If the line does not match, the
<code>next</code> statement just moves on to the next record.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0021_007d-_0028exclamation-point_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_0021_007d-operator-1762"></a><a name="index-exclamation-point-_0028_0040code_007b_0021_007d_0029_002c-_0040code_007b_0021_007d-operator-1763"></a>A number of additional tests are made, but they are only done if we
are not counting lines.  First, if the user only wants exit status
(<code>no_print</code> is true), then it is enough to know that <em>one</em>
line in this file matched, and we can skip on to the next file with
<code>nextfile</code>.  Similarly, if we are only printing file names, we can
print the file name, and then skip to the next file with <code>nextfile</code>. 
Finally, each line is printed, with a leading file name and colon
if necessary:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0021_007d-operator-1764"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/egrep.awk -->

         matches = ($0 ~ pattern)
         if (invert)
             matches = ! matches
     
         fcount += matches    # 1 or 0
     
         if (! matches)
             next
     
         if (! count_only) {
             if (no_print)
                 nextfile

     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <code>END</code> rule takes care of producing the correct exit status. If
there are no matches, the exit status is one; otherwise it is zero:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/egrep.awk -->
     END    \
     {
         if (total == 0)
             exit 1
         exit 0
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <code>usage</code> function prints a usage message in case of invalid options,
and then exits:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/egrep.awk -->
     function usage(    e)
     {
         e = "Usage: egrep [-csvil] [-e pat] [files ...]"
         e = e "\n\tegrep [-csvil] pat [files ...]"
         print e &gt; "/dev/stderr"
         exit 1
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The variable <code>e</code> is used so that the function fits nicely
on the printed page.

rule uses backslash continuation, with the open brace on a line by
itself.  This is so that it more closely resembles the way functions
are written.  Many of the examples
in this chapter
use this style. You can decide for yourself if you like writing
your <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules this way
or not.

real and effective group ID numbers, and the user's group set, if any. 
<span class="command">id</span> only prints the effective user ID and group ID if they are
different from the real ones.  If possible, <span class="command">id</span> also supplies the
corresponding user and group names.  The output might look like this:

<pre class="example">     $ id
     -| uid=2076(arnold) gid=10(staff) groups=10(staff),4(tty)
</pre>
   <p>This information is part of what is provided by <span class="command">gawk</span>'s
<code>PROCINFO</code> array (see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>). 
However, the <span class="command">id</span> utility provides a more palatable output than just
individual numbers.

   <p>Here is a simple version of <span class="command">id</span> written in <span class="command">awk</span>. 
It uses the user database library functions
(see <a href="#Passwd-Functions">Passwd Functions</a>)
and the group database library functions
(see <a href="#Group-Functions">Group Functions</a>):

   <p>The program is fairly straightforward.  All the work is done in the
<code>BEGIN</code> rule.  The user and group ID numbers are obtained from
<code>PROCINFO</code>. 
The code is repetitive.  The entry in the user database for the real user ID
number is split into parts at the <span class="samp">:</span>. The name is the first field. 
Similar code is used for the effective user ID number and the group
numbers:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bid_002eawk_007d-program-1771"></a>

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bin_007d-operator-1772"></a>The test in the <code>for</code> loop is worth noting. 
Any supplementary groups in the <code>PROCINFO</code> array have the
indices <code>"group1"</code> through <code>"group</code><var>N</var><code>"</code> for some
<var>N</var>, i.e., the total number of supplementary groups. 
However, we don't know in advance how many of these groups
there are.

   <p>This loop works by starting at one, concatenating the value with
<code>"group"</code>, and then using <code>in</code> to see if that value is
in the array.  Eventually, <code>i</code> is incremented past
the last group in the array and the loop exits.

   <p>The loop is also correct if there are <em>no</em> supplementary
groups; then the condition is false the first time it's
tested, and the loop body never executes.

<h4 class="subsection">13.2.4 Splitting a Large File into Pieces</h4>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE filspl -->
<p><a name="index-files_002c-splitting-1773"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bsplit_007d-utility-1774"></a>The <code>split</code> program splits large text files into smaller pieces. 
Usage is as follows:

<pre class="example">     split <span class="roman">[</span>-<var>count</var><span class="roman">]</span> file <span class="roman">[</span> <var>prefix</var> <span class="roman">]</span>
</pre>
   <p>By default,
the output files are named <span class="file">xaa</span>, <span class="file">xab</span>, and so on. Each file has
1000 lines in it, with the likely exception of the last file. To change the
number of lines in each file, supply a number on the command line
preceded with a minus; e.g., <span class="samp">-500</span> for files with 500 lines in them
instead of 1000.  To change the name of the output files to something like
<span class="file">myfileaa</span>, <span class="file">myfileab</span>, and so on, supply an additional
argument that specifies the file name prefix.

   <p>Here is a version of <code>split</code> in <span class="command">awk</span>. It uses the <code>ord</code> and
<code>chr</code> functions presented in
<a href="#Ordinal-Functions">Ordinal Functions</a>.

   <p>The program first sets its defaults, and then tests to make sure there are
not too many arguments.  It then looks at each argument in turn.  The
first argument could be a minus sign followed by a number. If it is, this happens
to look like a negative number, so it is made positive, and that is the
count of lines.  The data file name is skipped over and the final argument
is used as the prefix for the output file names:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bsplit_002eawk_007d-program-1775"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/split.awk -->
     # split.awk --- do split in awk
     #
     # Requires ord and chr library functions
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/prog/split.awk -->
     # usage: split [-num] [file] [outname]
     
     BEGIN {
         outfile = "x"    # default
         count = 1000
         if (ARGC &gt; 4)
             usage()
     
         i = 1
         if (ARGV[i] ~ /^-[0-9]+$/) {
             count = -ARGV[i]
             ARGV[i] = ""
             i++
         }
         # test argv in case reading from stdin instead of file
         if (i in ARGV)
             i++    # skip data file name
         if (i in ARGV) {
             outfile = ARGV[i]
             ARGV[i] = ""
         }
     
         s1 = s2 = "a"
         out = (outfile s1 s2)
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The next rule does most of the work. <code>tcount</code> (temporary count) tracks
how many lines have been printed to the output file so far. If it is greater
than <code>count</code>, it is time to close the current file and start a new one. 
<code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> track the current suffixes for the file name. If
they are both <span class="samp">z</span>, the file is just too big.  Otherwise, <code>s1</code>
moves to the next letter in the alphabet and <code>s2</code> starts over again at
<span class="samp">a</span>:

<!-- else on separate line here for page breaking -->
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/split.awk -->
     {
         if (++tcount &gt; count) {
             close(out)
             if (s2 == "z") {
                 if (s1 == "z") {
                     printf("split: %s is too large to split\n",
                            FILENAME) &gt; "/dev/stderr"
                     exit 1
                 }
                 s1 = chr(ord(s1) + 1)
                 s2 = "a"
             }
             else
                 s2 = chr(ord(s2) + 1)
             out = (outfile s1 s2)
             tcount = 1
         }
         print &gt; out
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <!-- Exercise: do this with just awk builtin functions, index("abc..."), substr, etc. -->
<p class="noindent">The <code>usage</code> function simply prints an error message and exits:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/split.awk -->
     function usage(   e)
     {
         e = "usage: split [-num] [file] [outname]"
         print e &gt; "/dev/stderr"
         exit 1
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The variable <code>e</code> is used so that the function
fits nicely on the
page.

   <p>This program is a bit sloppy; it relies on <span class="command">awk</span> to automatically close the last file
instead of doing it in an <code>END</code> rule. 
It also assumes that letters are contiguous in the character set,
which isn't true for EBCDIC systems.

its standard input to its standard output and also duplicates it to the
files named on the command line.  Its usage is as follows:

<pre class="example">     tee <span class="roman">[</span>-a<span class="roman">]</span> file ...
</pre>
   <p>The <span class="option">-a</span> option tells <code>tee</code> to append to the named files, instead of
truncating them and starting over.

   <p>The <code>BEGIN</code> rule first makes a copy of all the command-line arguments
into an array named <code>copy</code>. 
<code>ARGV[0]</code> is not copied, since it is not needed. 
<code>tee</code> cannot use <code>ARGV</code> directly, since <span class="command">awk</span> attempts to
process each file name in <code>ARGV</code> as input data.

   <p><a name="index-flag-variables-1779"></a>If the first argument is <span class="option">-a</span>, then the flag variable
<code>append</code> is set to true, and both <code>ARGV[1]</code> and
<code>copy[1]</code> are deleted. If <code>ARGC</code> is less than two, then no
file names were supplied and <code>tee</code> prints a usage message and exits. 
Finally, <span class="command">awk</span> is forced to read the standard input by setting
<code>ARGV[1]</code> to <code>"-"</code> and <code>ARGC</code> to two:

<!-- NEXT ED: Add more leading commentary in this program -->
<p><a name="index-_0040code_007btee_002eawk_007d-program-1780"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/tee.awk -->
     # tee.awk --- tee in awk
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/prog/tee.awk -->
     BEGIN    \
     {
         for (i = 1; i &lt; ARGC; i++)
             copy[i] = ARGV[i]
     
         if (ARGV[1] == "-a") {
             append = 1
             delete ARGV[1]
             delete copy[1]
             ARGC--
         }
         if (ARGC &lt; 2) {
             print "usage: tee [-a] file ..." &gt; "/dev/stderr"
             exit 1
         }
         ARGV[1] = "-"
         ARGC = 2
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The single rule does all the work.  Since there is no pattern, it is
executed for each line of input.  The body of the rule simply prints the
line into each file on the command line, and then to the standard output:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/tee.awk -->
     {
         # moving the if outside the loop makes it run faster
         if (append)
             for (i in copy)
                 print &gt;&gt; copy[i]
         else
             for (i in copy)
                 print &gt; copy[i]
         print
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It is also possible to write the loop this way:

<pre class="example">     for (i in copy)
         if (append)
             print &gt;&gt; copy[i]
         else
             print &gt; copy[i]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is more concise but it is also less efficient.  The <span class="samp">if</span> is
tested for each record and for each output file.  By duplicating the loop
body, the <span class="samp">if</span> is only tested once for each input record.  If there are
<var>N</var> input records and <var>M</var> output files, the first method only
executes <var>N</var> <span class="samp">if</span> statements, while the second executes
<var>N</var><code>*</code><var>M</var> <span class="samp">if</span> statements.

   <p>Finally, the <code>END</code> rule cleans up by closing all the output files:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/tee.awk -->
     END    \
     {
         for (i in copy)
             close(copy[i])

input, and by default removes duplicate lines.  In other words, it only
prints unique lines&mdash;hence the name.  <span class="command">uniq</span> has a number of
options. The usage is as follows:

<pre class="example">     uniq <span class="roman">[</span>-udc <span class="roman">[</span>-<var>n</var><span class="roman">]]</span> <span class="roman">[</span>+<var>n</var><span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">[</span> <var>input file</var> <span class="roman">[</span> <var>output file</var> <span class="roman">]]</span>
</pre>
   <p>The options for <span class="command">uniq</span> are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-d</code><dd>Pnly print only repeated lines.

     <br><dt><code>-u</code><dd>Print only nonrepeated lines.

     <br><dt><code>-c</code><dd>Count lines. This option overrides <span class="option">-d</span> and <span class="option">-u</span>.  Both repeated
and nonrepeated lines are counted.

     <br><dt><code>-</code><var>n</var><dd>Skip <var>n</var> fields before comparing lines.  The definition of fields
is similar to <span class="command">awk</span>'s default: nonwhitespace characters separated
by runs of spaces and/or tabs.

     <br><dt><code>+</code><var>n</var><dd>Skip <var>n</var> characters before comparing lines.  Any fields specified with
<span class="samp">-</span><var>n</var> are skipped first.

     <br><dt><var>input file</var><dd>Data is read from the input file named on the command line, instead of from
the standard input.

     <br><dt><var>output file</var><dd>The generated output is sent to the named output file, instead of to the
standard output. 
</dl>

   <p>Normally <span class="command">uniq</span> behaves as if both the <span class="option">-d</span> and
<span class="option">-u</span> options are provided.

   <p><span class="command">uniq</span> uses the
<code>getopt</code> library function
(see <a href="#Getopt-Function">Getopt Function</a>)
and the <code>join</code> library function
(see <a href="#Join-Function">Join Function</a>).

   <p>The program begins with a <code>usage</code> function and then a brief outline of
the options and their meanings in a comment. 
The <code>BEGIN</code> rule deals with the command-line arguments and options. It
uses a trick to get <code>getopt</code> to handle options of the form <span class="samp">-25</span>,
treating such an option as the option letter <span class="samp">2</span> with an argument of
<span class="samp">5</span>. If indeed two or more digits are supplied (<code>Optarg</code> looks
like a number), <code>Optarg</code> is
concatenated with the option digit and then the result is added to zero to make
it into a number.  If there is only one digit in the option, then
<code>Optarg</code> is not needed. In this case, <code>Optind</code> must be decremented so that
<code>getopt</code> processes it next time.  This code is admittedly a bit
tricky.

   <p>If no options are supplied, then the default is taken, to print both
repeated and nonrepeated lines.  The output file, if provided, is assigned
to <code>outputfile</code>.  Early on, <code>outputfile</code> is initialized to the
standard output, <span class="file">/dev/stdout</span>:

   <p>The following function, <code>are_equal</code>, compares the current line,
<code>$0</code>, to the
previous line, <code>last</code>.  It handles skipping fields and characters. 
If no field count and no character count are specified, <code>are_equal</code>
simply returns one or zero depending upon the result of a simple string
comparison of <code>last</code> and <code>$0</code>.  Otherwise, things get more
complicated. 
If fields have to be skipped, each line is broken into an array using
<code>split</code>
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>);
the desired fields are then joined back into a line using <code>join</code>. 
The joined lines are stored in <code>clast</code> and <code>cline</code>. 
If no fields are skipped, <code>clast</code> and <code>cline</code> are set to
<code>last</code> and <code>$0</code>, respectively. 
Finally, if characters are skipped, <code>substr</code> is used to strip off the
leading <code>charcount</code> characters in <code>clast</code> and <code>cline</code>.  The
two strings are then compared and <code>are_equal</code> returns the result:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/uniq.awk -->
     function are_equal(    n, m, clast, cline, alast, aline)
     {
         if (fcount == 0 &amp;&amp; charcount == 0)
             return (last == $0)
     
         if (fcount &gt; 0) {
             n = split(last, alast)
             m = split($0, aline)
             clast = join(alast, fcount+1, n)
             cline = join(aline, fcount+1, m)
         } else {
             clast = last
             cline = $0
         }
         if (charcount) {
             clast = substr(clast, charcount + 1)
             cline = substr(cline, charcount + 1)
         }
     
         return (clast == cline)
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The following two rules are the body of the program.  The first one is
executed only for the very first line of data.  It sets <code>last</code> equal to
<code>$0</code>, so that subsequent lines of text have something to be compared to.

   <p>The second rule does the work. The variable <code>equal</code> is one or zero,
depending upon the results of <code>are_equal</code>'s comparison. If <span class="command">uniq</span>
is counting repeated lines, and the lines are equal, then it increments the <code>count</code> variable. 
Otherwise, it prints the line and resets <code>count</code>,
since the two lines are not equal.

   <p>If <span class="command">uniq</span> is not counting, and if the lines are equal, <code>count</code> is incremented. 
Nothing is printed, since the point is to remove duplicates. 
Otherwise, if <span class="command">uniq</span> is counting repeated lines and more than
one line is seen, or if <span class="command">uniq</span> is counting nonrepeated lines
and only one line is seen, then the line is printed, and <code>count</code>
is reset.

   <p>Finally, similar logic is used in the <code>END</code> rule to print the final
line of input data:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/uniq.awk -->
     NR == 1 {
         last = $0
         next
     }
     
     {
         equal = are_equal()
     
         if (do_count) {    # overrides -d and -u
             if (equal)
                 count++
             else {
                 printf("%4d %s\n", count, last) &gt; outputfile
                 last = $0
                 count = 1    # reset
             }
             next
         }
     
         if (equal)
             count++
         else {
             if ((repeated_only &amp;&amp; count &gt; 1) ||
                 (non_repeated_only &amp;&amp; count == 1))
                     print last &gt; outputfile
             last = $0
             count = 1
         }
     }
     
     END {
         if (do_count)
             printf("%4d %s\n", count, last) &gt; outputfile
         else if ((repeated_only &amp;&amp; count &gt; 1) ||
                 (non_repeated_only &amp;&amp; count == 1))

<a name="index-lines_002c-counting-1789"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bwc_007d-utility-1790"></a>The <span class="command">wc</span> (word count) utility counts lines, words, and characters in
one or more input files. Its usage is as follows:

<pre class="example">     wc <span class="roman">[</span>-lwc<span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">[</span> <var>files</var> ... <span class="roman">]</span>
</pre>
   <p>If no files are specified on the command line, <span class="command">wc</span> reads its standard
input. If there are multiple files, it also prints total counts for all
the files.  The options and their meanings are shown in the following list:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-l</code><dd>Count only lines.

     <br><dt><code>-w</code><dd>Count only words. 
A &ldquo;word&rdquo; is a contiguous sequence of nonwhitespace characters, separated
by spaces and/or tabs.  Luckily, this is the normal way <span class="command">awk</span> separates
fields in its input data.

     <br><dt><code>-c</code><dd>Count only characters. 
</dl>

   <p>Implementing <span class="command">wc</span> in <span class="command">awk</span> is particularly elegant,
since <span class="command">awk</span> does a lot of the work for us; it splits lines into
words (i.e., fields) and counts them, it counts lines (i.e., records),
and it can easily tell us how long a line is.

   <p>This uses the <code>getopt</code> library function
(see <a href="#Getopt-Function">Getopt Function</a>)
and the file-transition functions
(see <a href="#Filetrans-Function">Filetrans Function</a>).

   <p>This version has one notable difference from traditional versions of
<span class="command">wc</span>: it always prints the counts in the order lines, words,
and characters.  Traditional versions note the order of the <span class="option">-l</span>,
<span class="option">-w</span>, and <span class="option">-c</span> options on the command line, and print the
counts in that order.

   <p>The <code>BEGIN</code> rule does the argument processing.  The variable
<code>print_total</code> is true if more than one file is named on the
command line:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bwc_002eawk_007d-program-1791"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/wc.awk -->
     # wc.awk --- count lines, words, characters
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/prog/wc.awk -->
     
     # Options:
     #    -l    only count lines
     #    -w    only count words
     #    -c    only count characters
     #
     # Default is to count lines, words, characters
     #
     # Requires getopt and file transition library functions
     
     BEGIN {
         # let getopt print a message about
         # invalid options. we ignore them
         while ((c = getopt(ARGC, ARGV, "lwc")) != -1) {
             if (c == "l")
                 do_lines = 1
             else if (c == "w")
                 do_words = 1
             else if (c == "c")
                 do_chars = 1
         }
         for (i = 1; i &lt; Optind; i++)
             ARGV[i] = ""
     
         # if no options, do all
         if (! do_lines &amp;&amp; ! do_words &amp;&amp; ! do_chars)
             do_lines = do_words = do_chars = 1
     
         print_total = (ARGC - i &gt; 2)
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <code>beginfile</code> function is simple; it just resets the counts of lines,
words, and characters to zero, and saves the current file name in
<code>fname</code>:

<!-- NEXT ED: make it lines = words = chars = 0 -->
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/wc.awk -->
     function beginfile(file)
     {
         chars = lines = words = 0
         fname = FILENAME
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <code>endfile</code> function adds the current file's numbers to the running
totals of lines, words, and characters.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-64" name="fnd-64"><sup>64</sup></a>  It then prints out those numbers
for the file that was just read. It relies on <code>beginfile</code> to reset the
numbers for the following data file:
<!-- ONE DAY: make the above footnote an exercise, instead of giving away the answer. -->

<!-- NEXT ED: make order for += be lines, words, chars -->
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/wc.awk -->
     function endfile(file)
     {
         tchars += chars
         tlines += lines
         twords += words
         if (do_lines)
             printf "\t%d", lines
         if (do_words)
             printf "\t%d", words
         if (do_chars)
             printf "\t%d", chars
         printf "\t%s\n", fname
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>There is one rule that is executed for each line. It adds the length of
the record, plus one, to <code>chars</code>.  Adding one plus the record length
is needed because the newline character separating records (the value
of <code>RS</code>) is not part of the record itself, and thus not included
in its length.  Next, <code>lines</code> is incremented for each line read,
and <code>words</code> is incremented by the value of <code>NF</code>, which is the
number of &ldquo;words&rdquo; on this line:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/wc.awk -->
     # do per line
     {
         chars += length($0) + 1    # get newline
         lines++
         words += NF
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>Finally, the <code>END</code> rule simply prints the totals for all the files:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/wc.awk -->
     END {
         if (print_total) {
             if (do_lines)
                 printf "\t%d", tlines
             if (do_words)
                 printf "\t%d", twords
             if (do_chars)
                 printf "\t%d", tchars
             print "\ttotal"
         }
     }
     <!-- endfile -->

duplicate words.  Typically you will see this in text as something like &ldquo;the
the program does the following<small class="dots">...</small>&rdquo;  When the text is online, often
the duplicated words occur at the end of one line and the beginning of
another, making them very difficult to spot. 
<!-- as here! -->

   <p>This program, <span class="file">dupword.awk</span>, scans through a file one line at a time
and looks for adjacent occurrences of the same word.  It also saves the last
word on a line (in the variable <code>prev</code>) for comparison with the first
word on the next line.

   <p><a name="index-Texinfo-1795"></a>The first two statements make sure that the line is all lowercase,
so that, for example, &ldquo;The&rdquo; and &ldquo;the&rdquo; compare equal to each other. 
The next statement replaces nonalphanumeric and nonwhitespace characters
with spaces, so that punctuation does not affect the comparison either. 
The characters are replaced with spaces so that formatting controls
don't create nonsense words (e.g., the Texinfo <span class="samp">@code{NF}</span>
becomes <span class="samp">codeNF</span> if punctuation is simply deleted).  The record is
then resplit into fields, yielding just the actual words on the line,
and ensuring that there are no empty fields.

   <p>If there are no fields left after removing all the punctuation, the
current record is skipped.  Otherwise, the program loops through each
word, comparing it to the previous one:

<p><a name="index-time_002c-alarm-clock-example-program-1799"></a><!-- STARTOFRANGE alaex -->
<a name="index-alarm-clock-example-program-1800"></a>The following program is a simple &ldquo;alarm clock&rdquo; program. 
You give it a time of day and an optional message.  At the specified time,
it prints the message on the standard output. In addition, you can give it
the number of times to repeat the message as well as a delay between
repetitions.

   <p>This program uses the <code>gettimeofday</code> function from
<a href="#Gettimeofday-Function">Gettimeofday Function</a>.

   <p>All the work is done in the <code>BEGIN</code> rule.  The first part is argument
checking and setting of defaults: the delay, the count, and the message to
print.  If the user supplied a message without the ASCII BEL
character (known as the &ldquo;alert&rdquo; character, <code>"\a"</code>), then it is added to
the message.  (On many systems, printing the ASCII BEL generates an
audible alert. Thus when the alarm goes off, the system calls attention
to itself in case the user is not looking at the computer or terminal.) 
Here is the program:

   <p>The next section of code turns the alarm time into hours and minutes,
converts it (if necessary) to a 24-hour clock, and then turns that
time into a count of the seconds since midnight.  Next it turns the current
time into a count of seconds since midnight.  The difference between the two
is how long to wait before setting off the alarm:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/alarm.awk -->
         # split up alarm time
         split(ARGV[1], atime, ":")
         hour = atime[1] + 0    # force numeric
         minute = atime[2] + 0  # force numeric
     
         # get current broken down time
         gettimeofday(now)
     
         # if time given is 12-hour hours and it's after that
         # hour, e.g., `alarm 5:30' at 9 a.m. means 5:30 p.m.,
         # then add 12 to real hour
         if (hour &lt; 12 &amp;&amp; now["hour"] &gt; hour)
             hour += 12
     
         # set target time in seconds since midnight
         target = (hour * 60 * 60) + (minute * 60)
     
         # get current time in seconds since midnight
         current = (now["hour"] * 60 * 60) + \
                    (now["minute"] * 60) + now["second"]
     
         # how long to sleep for
         naptime = target - current
         if (naptime &lt;= 0) {
             print "time is in the past!" &gt; "/dev/stderr"
             exit 1
         }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bsleep_007d-utility-1802"></a>Finally, the program uses the <code>system</code> function
(see <a href="#I_002fO-Functions">I/O Functions</a>)
to call the <span class="command">sleep</span> utility.  The <span class="command">sleep</span> utility simply pauses
for the given number of seconds.  If the exit status is not zero,
the program assumes that <span class="command">sleep</span> was interrupted and exits. If
<span class="command">sleep</span> exited with an OK status (zero), then the program prints the

<h4 class="subsection">13.3.3 Transliterating Characters</h4>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE chtra -->
<p><a name="index-characters_002c-transliterating-1803"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007btr_007d-utility-1804"></a>The system <span class="command">tr</span> utility transliterates characters.  For example, it is
often used to map uppercase letters into lowercase for further processing:

<pre class="example">     <var>generate data</var> | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | <var>process data</var> ...
</pre>
   <p><span class="command">tr</span> requires two lists of characters.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-65" name="fnd-65"><sup>65</sup></a>  When processing the input, the first character in the
first list is replaced with the first character in the second list,
the second character in the first list is replaced with the second
character in the second list, and so on.  If there are more characters
in the &ldquo;from&rdquo; list than in the &ldquo;to&rdquo; list, the last character of the
&ldquo;to&rdquo; list is used for the remaining characters in the &ldquo;from&rdquo; list.

   <p>Some time ago,
<!-- early or mid-1989! -->
a user proposed that a transliteration function should
be added to <span class="command">gawk</span>. 
<!-- Wishing to avoid gratuitous new features, -->
<!-- at least theoretically -->
The following program was written to
prove that character transliteration could be done with a user-level
function.  This program is not as complete as the system <span class="command">tr</span> utility
but it does most of the job.

   <p>The <span class="command">translate</span> program demonstrates one of the few weaknesses
of standard <span class="command">awk</span>: dealing with individual characters is very
painful, requiring repeated use of the <code>substr</code>, <code>index</code>,
and <code>gsub</code> built-in functions
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>).<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-66" name="fnd-66"><sup>66</sup></a>
<!-- Exercise: How might you use this new feature to simplify the program? -->
There are two functions.  The first, <code>stranslate</code>, takes three
arguments:

     <dl>
<dt><code>from</code><dd>A list of characters from which to translate.

     <br><dt><code>to</code><dd>A list of characters to which to translate.

     <br><dt><code>target</code><dd>The string on which to do the translation. 
</dl>

   <p>Associative arrays make the translation part fairly easy. <code>t_ar</code> holds
the &ldquo;to&rdquo; characters, indexed by the &ldquo;from&rdquo; characters.  Then a simple
loop goes through <code>from</code>, one character at a time.  For each character
in <code>from</code>, if the character appears in <code>target</code>, <code>gsub</code>
is used to change it to the corresponding <code>to</code> character.

   <p>The <code>translate</code> function simply calls <code>stranslate</code> using <code>$0</code>
as the target.  The main program sets two global variables, <code>FROM</code> and
<code>TO</code>, from the command line, and then changes <code>ARGV</code> so that
<span class="command">awk</span> reads from the standard input.

   <p>Finally, the processing rule simply calls <code>translate</code> for each record:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007btranslate_002eawk_007d-program-1805"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/translate.awk -->
     # translate.awk --- do tr-like stuff
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/prog/translate.awk -->
     # Bugs: does not handle things like: tr A-Z a-z, it has
     # to be spelled out. However, if `to' is shorter than `from',
     # the last character in `to' is used for the rest of `from'.
     
     function stranslate(from, to, target,     lf, lt, t_ar, i, c)
     {
         lf = length(from)
         lt = length(to)
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= lt; i++)
             t_ar[substr(from, i, 1)] = substr(to, i, 1)
         if (lt &lt; lf)
             for (; i &lt;= lf; i++)
                 t_ar[substr(from, i, 1)] = substr(to, lt, 1)
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= lf; i++) {
             c = substr(from, i, 1)
             if (index(target, c) &gt; 0)
                 gsub(c, t_ar[c], target)
         }
         return target
     }
     
     function translate(from, to)
     {
         return $0 = stranslate(from, to, $0)
     }
     
     # main program
     BEGIN {
         if (ARGC &lt; 3) {
             print "usage: translate from to" &gt; "/dev/stderr"
             exit
         }
         FROM = ARGV[1]
         TO = ARGV[2]
         ARGC = 2
         ARGV[1] = "-"
     }
     
     {
         translate(FROM, TO)
         print
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>While it is possible to do character transliteration in a user-level
function, it is not necessarily efficient, and we (the <span class="command">gawk</span>
authors) started to consider adding a built-in function.  However,
shortly after writing this program, we learned that the System V Release 4
<span class="command">awk</span> had added the <code>toupper</code> and <code>tolower</code> functions
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>). 
These functions handle the vast majority of the
cases where character transliteration is necessary, and so we chose to
simply add those functions to <span class="command">gawk</span> as well and then leave well
enough alone.

   <p>An obvious improvement to this program would be to set up the
<code>t_ar</code> array only once, in a <code>BEGIN</code> rule. However, this
assumes that the &ldquo;from&rdquo; and &ldquo;to&rdquo; lists
will never change throughout the lifetime of the program.

<h4 class="subsection">13.3.4 Printing Mailing Labels</h4>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE prml -->
<p><a name="index-printing_002c-mailing-labels-1806"></a><!-- STARTOFRANGE mlprint -->
<a name="index-mailing-labels_0040comma_007b_007d-printing-1807"></a>Here is a &ldquo;real world&rdquo;<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-67" name="fnd-67"><sup>67</sup></a>
program.  This
script reads lists of names and
addresses and generates mailing labels.  Each page of labels has 20 labels
on it, 2 across and 10 down.  The addresses are guaranteed to be no more
than 5 lines of data.  Each address is separated from the next by a blank
line.

   <p>The basic idea is to read 20 labels worth of data.  Each line of each label
is stored in the <code>line</code> array.  The single rule takes care of filling
the <code>line</code> array and printing the page when 20 labels have been read.

   <p>The <code>BEGIN</code> rule simply sets <code>RS</code> to the empty string, so that
<span class="command">awk</span> splits records at blank lines
(see <a href="#Records">Records</a>). 
It sets <code>MAXLINES</code> to 100, since 100 is the maximum number
of lines on the page (20 * 5 = 100).

   <p>Most of the work is done in the <code>printpage</code> function. 
The label lines are stored sequentially in the <code>line</code> array.  But they
have to print horizontally; <code>line[1]</code> next to <code>line[6]</code>,
<code>line[2]</code> next to <code>line[7]</code>, and so on.  Two loops are used to
accomplish this.  The outer loop, controlled by <code>i</code>, steps through
every 10 lines of data; this is each row of labels.  The inner loop,
controlled by <code>j</code>, goes through the lines within the row. 
As <code>j</code> goes from 0 to 4, <span class="samp">i+j</span> is the <code>j</code>-th line in
the row, and <span class="samp">i+j+5</span> is the entry next to it.  The output ends up
looking something like this:

<pre class="example">     line 1          line 6
     line 2          line 7
     line 3          line 8
     line 4          line 9
     line 5          line 10
     ...
</pre>
   <p>As a final note, an extra blank line is printed at lines 21 and 61, to keep
the output lined up on the labels.  This is dependent on the particular
brand of labels in use when the program was written.  You will also note
that there are 2 blank lines at the top and 2 blank lines at the bottom.

   <p>The <code>END</code> rule arranges to flush the final page of labels; there may
not have been an even multiple of 20 labels in the data:

The following <span class="command">awk</span> program prints
the number of occurrences of each word in its input.  It illustrates the
associative nature of <span class="command">awk</span> arrays by using strings as subscripts.  It
also demonstrates the <span class="samp">for </span><var>index</var><span class="samp"> in </span><var>array</var> mechanism. 
Finally, it shows how <span class="command">awk</span> is used in conjunction with other
utility programs to do a useful task of some complexity with a minimum of
effort.  Some explanations follow the program listing:

<pre class="example">     # Print list of word frequencies
     {
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i++)
             freq[$i]++
     }
     
     END {
         for (word in freq)
             printf "%s\t%d\n", word, freq[word]
     }
</pre>
   <!-- Exercise: Use asort() here -->
<p>This program has two rules.  The
first rule, because it has an empty pattern, is executed for every input line. 
It uses <span class="command">awk</span>'s field-accessing mechanism
(see <a href="#Fields">Fields</a>) to pick out the individual words from
the line, and the built-in variable <code>NF</code> (see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>)
to know how many fields are available. 
For each input word, it increments an element of the array <code>freq</code> to
reflect that the word has been seen an additional time.

   <p>The second rule, because it has the pattern <code>END</code>, is not executed
until the input has been exhausted.  It prints out the contents of the
<code>freq</code> table that has been built up inside the first action. 
This program has several problems that would prevent it from being
useful by itself on real text files:

     <ul>
<li>Words are detected using the <span class="command">awk</span> convention that fields are
separated just by whitespace.  Other characters in the input (except
newlines) don't have any special meaning to <span class="command">awk</span>.  This means that
punctuation characters count as part of words.

     <li>The <span class="command">awk</span> language considers upper- and lowercase characters to be
distinct.  Therefore, &ldquo;bartender&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bartender&rdquo; are not treated
as the same word.  This is undesirable, since in normal text, words
are capitalized if they begin sentences, and a frequency analyzer should not
be sensitive to capitalization.

     <li>The output does not come out in any useful order.  You're more likely to be
interested in which words occur most frequently or in having an alphabetized
table of how frequently each word occurs. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bsort_007d-utility-1810"></a>The way to solve these problems is to use some of <span class="command">awk</span>'s more advanced
features.  First, we use <code>tolower</code> to remove
case distinctions.  Next, we use <code>gsub</code> to remove punctuation
characters.  Finally, we use the system <span class="command">sort</span> utility to process the
output of the <span class="command">awk</span> script.  Here is the new version of
the program:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bwordfreq_002eawk_007d-program-1811"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/wordfreq.awk -->
     # wordfreq.awk --- print list of word frequencies
     
     {
         $0 = tolower($0)    # remove case distinctions
         # remove punctuation
         gsub(/[^[:alnum:]_[:blank:]]/, "", $0)
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i++)
             freq[$i]++
     }
     
     END {
         for (word in freq)
             printf "%s\t%d\n", word, freq[word]
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>Assuming we have saved this program in a file named <span class="file">wordfreq.awk</span>,
and that the data is in <span class="file">file1</span>, the following pipeline:

<pre class="example">     awk -f wordfreq.awk file1 | sort -k 2nr
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">produces a table of the words appearing in <span class="file">file1</span> in order of
decreasing frequency.  The <span class="command">awk</span> program suitably massages the
data and produces a word frequency table, which is not ordered.

   <p>The <span class="command">awk</span> script's output is then sorted by the <span class="command">sort</span>
utility and printed on the terminal.  The options given to <span class="command">sort</span>
specify a sort that uses the second field of each input line (skipping
one field), that the sort keys should be treated as numeric quantities
(otherwise <span class="samp">15</span> would come before <span class="samp">5</span>), and that the sorting
should be done in descending (reverse) order.

   <p>The <span class="command">sort</span> could even be done from within the program, by changing
the <code>END</code> action to:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/wordfreq.awk -->
     END {
         sort = "sort -k 2nr"
         for (word in freq)
             printf "%s\t%d\n", word, freq[word] | sort
         close(sort)
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>This way of sorting must be used on systems that do not
have true pipes at the command-line (or batch-file) level. 
See the general operating system documentation for more information on how
to use the <span class="command">sort</span> program.

<!-- STARTOFRANGE lidu -->
<p><a name="index-lines_002c-duplicate_0040comma_007b_007d-removing-1812"></a>The <span class="command">uniq</span> program
(see <a href="#Uniq-Program">Uniq Program</a>),
removes duplicate lines from <em>sorted</em> data.

   <p>Suppose, however, you need to remove duplicate lines from a data file but
that you want to preserve the order the lines are in.  A good example of
this might be a shell history file.  The history file keeps a copy of all
the commands you have entered, and it is not unusual to repeat a command
several times in a row.  Occasionally you might want to compact the history
by removing duplicate entries.  Yet it is desirable to maintain the order
of the original commands.

   <p>This simple program does the job.  It uses two arrays.  The <code>data</code>
array is indexed by the text of each line. 
For each line, <code>data[$0]</code> is incremented. 
If a particular line has not
been seen before, then <code>data[$0]</code> is zero. 
In this case, the text of the line is stored in <code>lines[count]</code>. 
Each element of <code>lines</code> is a unique command, and the indices of
<code>lines</code> indicate the order in which those lines are encountered. 
The <code>END</code> rule simply prints out the lines, in order:

   <p>This works because <code>data[$0]</code> is incremented each time a line is

<h4 class="subsection">13.3.7 Extracting Programs from Texinfo Source Files</h4>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE texse -->
<p><a name="index-Texinfo_002c-extracting-programs-from-source-files-1815"></a><!-- STARTOFRANGE fitex -->
<a name="index-files_002c-Texinfo_0040comma_007b_007d-extracting-programs-from-1816"></a>Both this chapter and the previous chapter
(<a href="#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>)
present a large number of <span class="command">awk</span> programs. 
If you want to experiment with these programs, it is tedious to have to type
them in by hand.  Here we present a program that can extract parts of a
Texinfo input file into separate files.

   <p><a name="index-Texinfo-1817"></a>This Web page is written in Texinfo, the GNU project's document
formatting
language. 
A single Texinfo source file can be used to produce both
printed and online documentation. 
Texinfo is fully documented in the book
<cite>Texinfo&mdash;The GNU Documentation Format</cite>,
available from the Free Software Foundation.

   <p>For our purposes, it is enough to know three things about Texinfo input
files:

     <ul>
<li>The &ldquo;at&rdquo; symbol (<span class="samp">@</span>) is special in Texinfo, much as
the backslash (<span class="samp">\</span>) is in C
or <span class="command">awk</span>.  Literal <span class="samp">@</span> symbols are represented in Texinfo source
files as <span class="samp">@@</span>.

     <li>Comments start with either <span class="samp">@c</span> or <span class="samp">@comment</span>. 
The file-extraction program works by using special comments that start
at the beginning of a line.

     <li>Lines containing <span class="samp">@group</span> and <span class="samp">@end group</span> commands bracket
example text that should not be split across a page boundary. 
(Unfortunately, TeX isn't always smart enough to do things exactly right,
and we have to give it some help.) 
</ul>

   <p>The following program, <span class="file">extract.awk</span>, reads through a Texinfo source
file and does two things, based on the special comments. 
Upon seeing <span class="samp">@c&nbsp;system&nbsp;...<!-- /@w --></span>,
it runs a command, by extracting the command text from the
control line and passing it on to the <code>system</code> function
(see <a href="#I_002fO-Functions">I/O Functions</a>). 
Upon seeing <span class="samp">@c file </span><var>filename</var>, each subsequent line is sent to
the file <var>filename</var>, until <span class="samp">@c endfile</span> is encountered. 
The rules in <span class="file">extract.awk</span> match either <span class="samp">@c</span> or
<span class="samp">@comment</span> by letting the <span class="samp">omment</span> part be optional. 
Lines containing <span class="samp">@group</span> and <span class="samp">@end group</span> are simply removed. 
<span class="file">extract.awk</span> uses the <code>join</code> library function
(see <a href="#Join-Function">Join Function</a>).

   <p>The example programs in the online Texinfo source for <cite>GAWK: Effective AWK Programming</cite>
(<span class="file">gawk.texi</span>) have all been bracketed inside <span class="samp">file</span> and
<span class="samp">endfile</span> lines.  The <span class="command">gawk</span> distribution uses a copy of
<span class="file">extract.awk</span> to extract the sample programs and install many
of them in a standard directory where <span class="command">gawk</span> can find them. 
The Texinfo file looks something like this:

<pre class="example">     ...
     This program has a @code{BEGIN} rule,
     that prints a nice message:
     
     @example
     @c file examples/messages.awk
     BEGIN @{ print "Don't panic!" @}
     @c end file
     @end example
     
     It also prints some final advice:
     
     @example
     @c file examples/messages.awk
     END @{ print "Always avoid bored archeologists!" @}
     @c end file
     @end example
     ...
</pre>
   <p><span class="file">extract.awk</span> begins by setting <code>IGNORECASE</code> to one, so that
mixed upper- and lowercase letters in the directives won't matter.

   <p>The first rule handles calling <code>system</code>, checking that a command is
given (<code>NF</code> is at least three) and also checking that the command
exits with a zero exit status, signifying OK:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bextract_002eawk_007d-program-1818"></a>
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/extract.awk -->
     # extract.awk --- extract files and run programs
     #                 from texinfo files
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/prog/extract.awk -->
     BEGIN    { IGNORECASE = 1 }
     
     /^@c(omment)?[ \t]+system/    \
     {
         if (NF &lt; 3) {
             e = (FILENAME ":" FNR)
             e = (e  ": badly formed `system' line")
             print e &gt; "/dev/stderr"
             next
         }
         $1 = ""
         $2 = ""
         stat = system($0)
         if (stat != 0) {
             e = (FILENAME ":" FNR)
             e = (e ": warning: system returned " stat)
             print e &gt; "/dev/stderr"
         }
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The variable <code>e</code> is used so that the function
fits nicely on the
page. 
screen.

   <p>The second rule handles moving data into files.  It verifies that a
file name is given in the directive.  If the file named is not the
current file, then the current file is closed.  Keeping the current file
open until a new file is encountered allows the use of the <span class="samp">&gt;</span>
redirection for printing the contents, keeping open file management
simple.

   <p>The <span class="samp">for</span> loop does the work.  It reads lines using <code>getline</code>
(see <a href="#Getline">Getline</a>). 
For an unexpected end of file, it calls the <code>unexpected_eof<!-- /@w --></code>
function.  If the line is an &ldquo;endfile&rdquo; line, then it breaks out of
the loop. 
If the line is an <span class="samp">@group</span> or <span class="samp">@end group</span> line, then it
ignores it and goes on to the next line. 
Similarly, comments within examples are also ignored.

   <p>Most of the work is in the following few lines.  If the line has no <span class="samp">@</span>
symbols, the program can print it directly. 
Otherwise, each leading <span class="samp">@</span> must be stripped off. 
To remove the <span class="samp">@</span> symbols, the line is split into separate elements of
the array <code>a</code>, using the <code>split</code> function
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>). 
The <span class="samp">@</span> symbol is used as the separator character. 
Each element of <code>a</code> that is empty indicates two successive <span class="samp">@</span>
symbols in the original line.  For each two empty elements (<span class="samp">@@</span> in
the original file), we have to add a single <span class="samp">@</span> symbol back in.

   <p>When the processing of the array is finished, <code>join</code> is called with the
value of <code>SUBSEP</code>, to rejoin the pieces back into a single
line.  That line is then printed to the output file:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/extract.awk -->
     /^@c(omment)?[ \t]+file/    \
     {
         if (NF != 3) {
             e = (FILENAME ":" FNR ": badly formed `file' line")
             print e &gt; "/dev/stderr"
             next
         }
         if ($3 != curfile) {
             if (curfile != "")
                 close(curfile)
             curfile = $3
         }
     
         for (;;) {
             if ((getline line) &lt;= 0)
                 unexpected_eof()
             if (line ~ /^@c(omment)?[ \t]+endfile/)
                 break
             else if (line ~ /^@(end[ \t]+)?group/)
                 continue
             else if (line ~ /^@c(omment+)?[ \t]+/)
                 continue
             if (index(line, "@") == 0) {
                 print line &gt; curfile
                 continue
             }
             n = split(line, a, "@")
             # if a[1] == "", means leading @,
             # don't add one back in.
             for (i = 2; i &lt;= n; i++) {
                 if (a[i] == "") { # was an @@
                     a[i] = "@"
                     if (a[i+1] == "")
                         i++
                 }
             }
             print join(a, 1, n, SUBSEP) &gt; curfile
         }
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>An important thing to note is the use of the <span class="samp">&gt;</span> redirection. 
Output done with <span class="samp">&gt;</span> only opens the file once; it stays open and
subsequent output is appended to the file
(see <a href="#Redirection">Redirection</a>). 
This makes it easy to mix program text and explanatory prose for the same
sample source file (as has been done here!) without any hassle.  The file is
only closed when a new data file name is encountered or at the end of the
input file.

   <p>Finally, the function <code>unexpected_eof<!-- /@w --></code> prints an appropriate
error message and then exits. 
The <code>END</code> rule handles the final cleanup, closing the open file:

<!-- function lb put on same line for page breaking. sigh -->
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/extract.awk -->
     function unexpected_eof() {
         printf("%s:%d: unexpected EOF or error\n",
             FILENAME, FNR) &gt; "/dev/stderr"
         exit 1
     }
     
     END {
         if (curfile)
             close(curfile)
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>

<h4 class="subsection">13.3.8 A Simple Stream Editor</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040command_007bsed_007d-utility-1819"></a><a name="index-stream-editors-1820"></a>The <span class="command">sed</span> utility is a stream editor, a program that reads a
stream of data, makes changes to it, and passes it on. 
It is often used to make global changes to a large file or to a stream
of data generated by a pipeline of commands. 
While <span class="command">sed</span> is a complicated program in its own right, its most common
use is to perform global substitutions in the middle of a pipeline:

<pre class="example">     command1 &lt; orig.data | sed 's/old/new/g' | command2 &gt; result
</pre>
   <p>Here, <span class="samp">s/old/new/g</span> tells <span class="command">sed</span> to look for the regexp
<span class="samp">old</span> on each input line and globally replace it with the text
<span class="samp">new</span>, i.e., all the occurrences on a line.  This is similar to
<span class="command">awk</span>'s <code>gsub</code> function
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>).

   <p>The following program, <span class="file">awksed.awk</span>, accepts at least two command-line
arguments: the pattern to look for and the text to replace it with. Any
additional arguments are treated as data file names to process. If none
are provided, the standard input is used:

   <p><a name="index-Brennan_002c-Michael-1821"></a><a name="index-_0040command_007bawksed_002eawk_007d-program-1822"></a><!-- @cindex simple stream editor -->
<!-- @cindex stream editor, simple -->
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/awksed.awk -->
     # awksed.awk --- do s/foo/bar/g using just print
     #    Thanks to Michael Brennan for the idea
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/prog/awksed.awk -->
     function usage()
     {
         print "usage: awksed pat repl [files...]" &gt; "/dev/stderr"
         exit 1
     }
     
     BEGIN {
         # validate arguments
         if (ARGC &lt; 3)
             usage()
     
         RS = ARGV[1]
         ORS = ARGV[2]
     
         # don't use arguments as files
         ARGV[1] = ARGV[2] = ""
     }
     
     # look ma, no hands!
     {
         if (RT == "")
             printf "%s", $0
         else
             print
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The program relies on <span class="command">gawk</span>'s ability to have <code>RS</code> be a regexp,
as well as on the setting of <code>RT</code> to the actual text that terminates the
record (see <a href="#Records">Records</a>).

   <p>The idea is to have <code>RS</code> be the pattern to look for. <span class="command">gawk</span>
automatically sets <code>$0</code> to the text between matches of the pattern. 
This is text that we want to keep, unmodified.  Then, by setting <code>ORS</code>
to the replacement text, a simple <code>print</code> statement outputs the
text we want to keep, followed by the replacement text.

   <p>There is one wrinkle to this scheme, which is what to do if the last record
doesn't end with text that matches <code>RS</code>.  Using a <code>print</code>
statement unconditionally prints the replacement text, which is not correct. 
However, if the file did not end in text that matches <code>RS</code>, <code>RT</code>
is set to the null string.  In this case, we can print <code>$0</code> using
<code>printf</code>
(see <a href="#Printf">Printf</a>).

   <p>The <code>BEGIN</code> rule handles the setup, checking for the right number
of arguments and calling <code>usage</code> if there is a problem. Then it sets
<code>RS</code> and <code>ORS</code> from the command-line arguments and sets
<code>ARGV[1]</code> and <code>ARGV[2]</code> to the null string, so that they are
not treated as file names
(see <a href="#ARGC-and-ARGV">ARGC and ARGV</a>).

   <p>The <code>usage</code> function prints an error message and exits. 
Finally, the single rule handles the printing scheme outlined above,
using <code>print</code> or <code>printf</code> as appropriate, depending upon the
value of <code>RT</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">13.3.9 An Easy Way to Use Library Functions</h4>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE libfex -->
<p><a name="index-libraries-of-_0040command_007bawk_007d-functions_002c-example-program-for-using-1823"></a><!-- STARTOFRANGE flibex -->
<a name="index-functions_002c-library_002c-example-program-for-using-1824"></a>Using library functions in <span class="command">awk</span> can be very beneficial. It
encourages code reuse and the writing of general functions. Programs are
smaller and therefore clearer. 
However, using library functions is only easy when writing <span class="command">awk</span>
programs; it is painful when running them, requiring multiple <span class="option">-f</span>
options.  If <span class="command">gawk</span> is unavailable, then so too is the <span class="env">AWKPATH</span>
environment variable and the ability to put <span class="command">awk</span> functions into a
library directory (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>). 
It would be nice to be able to write programs in the following manner:

<pre class="example">     # library functions
     @include getopt.awk
     @include join.awk
     ...
     
     # main program
     BEGIN {
         while ((c = getopt(ARGC, ARGV, "a:b:cde")) != -1)
             ...
         ...
     }
</pre>
   <p>The following program, <span class="file">igawk.sh</span>, provides this service. 
It simulates <span class="command">gawk</span>'s searching of the <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> variable
and also allows <dfn>nested</dfn> includes; i.e., a file that is included
with <span class="samp">@include</span> can contain further <span class="samp">@include</span> statements. 
<span class="command">igawk</span> makes an effort to only include files once, so that nested
includes don't accidentally include a library function twice.

   <p><span class="command">igawk</span> should behave just like <span class="command">gawk</span> externally.  This
means it should accept all of <span class="command">gawk</span>'s command-line arguments,
including the ability to have multiple source files specified via
<span class="option">-f</span>, and the ability to mix command-line and library source files.

   <p>The program is written using the POSIX Shell (<span class="command">sh</span>) command
language.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-68" name="fnd-68"><sup>68</sup></a> It works as follows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Loop through the arguments, saving anything that doesn't represent
<span class="command">awk</span> source code for later, when the expanded program is run.

     <li>For any arguments that do represent <span class="command">awk</span> text, put the arguments into
a shell variable that will be expanded.  There are two cases:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Literal text, provided with <span class="option">--source</span> or <span class="option">--source=</span>.  This
text is just appended directly.

          <li>Source file names, provided with <span class="option">-f</span>.  We use a neat trick and append
<span class="samp">@include </span><var>filename</var> to the shell variable's contents.  Since the file-inclusion
program works the way <span class="command">gawk</span> does, this gets the text
of the file included into the program at the correct point.
          </ol>

     <li>Run an <span class="command">awk</span> program (naturally) over the shell variable's contents to expand
<span class="samp">@include</span> statements.  The expanded program is placed in a second
shell variable.

     <li>Run the expanded program with <span class="command">gawk</span> and any other original command-line
arguments that the user supplied (such as the data file names).
        </ol>

   <p>This program uses shell variables extensively; for storing command line arguments,
the text of the <span class="command">awk</span> program that will expand the user's program, for the
user's original program, and for the expanded program.  Doing so removes some
potential problems that might arise were we to use temporary files instead,
at the cost of making the script somewhat more complicated.

   <p>The initial part of the program turns on shell tracing if the first
argument is <span class="samp">debug</span>.

   <p>The next part loops through all the command-line arguments. 
There are several cases of interest:

     <dl>
<dt><code>--</code><dd>This ends the arguments to <span class="command">igawk</span>.  Anything else should be passed on
to the user's <span class="command">awk</span> program without being evaluated.

     <br><dt><code>-W</code><dd>This indicates that the next option is specific to <span class="command">gawk</span>.  To make
argument processing easier, the <span class="option">-W</span> is appended to the front of the
remaining arguments and the loop continues.  (This is an <span class="command">sh</span>
programming trick.  Don't worry about it if you are not familiar with
<span class="command">sh</span>.)

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><span class="roman">,</span><code> -F</code><dd>These are saved and passed on to <span class="command">gawk</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-f</code><span class="roman">,</span><code> --file</code><span class="roman">,</span><code> --file=</code><span class="roman">,</span><code> -Wfile=</code><dd>The file name is appended to the shell variable <code>program</code> with an
<span class="samp">@include</span> statement. 
The <span class="command">expr</span> utility is used to remove the leading option part of the
argument (e.g., <span class="samp">--file=</span>). 
(Typical <span class="command">sh</span> usage would be to use the <span class="command">echo</span> and <span class="command">sed</span>
utilities to do this work.  Unfortunately, some versions of <span class="command">echo</span> evaluate
escape sequences in their arguments, possibly mangling the program text. 
Using <span class="command">expr</span> avoids this problem.)

     <br><dt><code>--source</code><span class="roman">,</span><code> --source=</code><span class="roman">,</span><code> -Wsource=</code><dd>The source text is appended to <code>program</code>.

     <br><dt><code>--version</code><span class="roman">,</span><code> -Wversion</code><dd><span class="command">igawk</span> prints its version number, runs <span class="samp">gawk --version</span>
to get the <span class="command">gawk</span> version information, and then exits. 
</dl>

   <p>If none of the <span class="option">-f</span>, <span class="option">--file</span>, <span class="option">-Wfile</span>, <span class="option">--source</span>,
or <span class="option">-Wsource</span> arguments are supplied, then the first nonoption argument
should be the <span class="command">awk</span> program.  If there are no command-line
arguments left, <span class="command">igawk</span> prints an error message and exits. 
Otherwise, the first argument is appended to <code>program</code>. 
In any case, after the arguments have been processed,
<code>program</code> contains the complete text of the original <span class="command">awk</span>
program.

   <p>The program is as follows:

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bigawk_002esh_007d-program-1825"></a>

</pre>
   <p>The <span class="command">awk</span> program to process <span class="samp">@include</span> directives
is stored in the shell variable <code>expand_prog</code>.  Doing this keeps
the shell script readable.  The <span class="command">awk</span> program
reads through the user's program, one line at a time, using <code>getline</code>
(see <a href="#Getline">Getline</a>).  The input
file names and <span class="samp">@include</span> statements are managed using a stack. 
As each <span class="samp">@include</span> is encountered, the current file name is
&ldquo;pushed&rdquo; onto the stack and the file named in the <span class="samp">@include</span>
directive becomes the current file name.  As each file is finished,
the stack is &ldquo;popped,&rdquo; and the previous input file becomes the current
input file again.  The process is started by making the original file
the first one on the stack.

   <p>The <code>pathto</code> function does the work of finding the full path to
a file.  It simulates <span class="command">gawk</span>'s behavior when searching the
<span class="env">AWKPATH</span> environment variable
(see <a href="#AWKPATH-Variable">AWKPATH Variable</a>). 
If a file name has a <span class="samp">/</span> in it, no path search is done. Otherwise,
the file name is concatenated with the name of each directory in
the path, and an attempt is made to open the generated file name. 
The only way to test if a file can be read in <span class="command">awk</span> is to go
ahead and try to read it with <code>getline</code>; this is what <code>pathto</code>
does.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-69" name="fnd-69"><sup>69</sup></a> If the file can be read, it is closed and the file name
is returned:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/igawk.sh -->
     expand_prog='
     
     function pathto(file,    i, t, junk)
     {
         if (index(file, "/") != 0)
             return file
     
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= ndirs; i++) {
             t = (pathlist[i] "/" file)
             if ((getline junk &lt; t) &gt; 0) {
                 # found it
                 close(t)
                 return t
             }
         }
         return ""
     }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The main program is contained inside one <code>BEGIN</code> rule.  The first thing it
does is set up the <code>pathlist</code> array that <code>pathto</code> uses.  After
splitting the path on <span class="samp">:</span>, null elements are replaced with <code>"."</code>,
which represents the current directory:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/igawk.sh -->
     BEGIN {
         path = ENVIRON["AWKPATH"]
         ndirs = split(path, pathlist, ":")
         for (i = 1; i &lt;= ndirs; i++) {
             if (pathlist[i] == "")
                 pathlist[i] = "."
         }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The stack is initialized with <code>ARGV[1]</code>, which will be <span class="file">/dev/stdin</span>. 
The main loop comes next.  Input lines are read in succession. Lines that
do not start with <span class="samp">@include</span> are printed verbatim. 
If the line does start with <span class="samp">@include</span>, the file name is in <code>$2</code>. 
<code>pathto</code> is called to generate the full path.  If it cannot, then we
print an error message and continue.

   <p>The next thing to check is if the file is included already.  The
<code>processed</code> array is indexed by the full file name of each included
file and it tracks this information for us.  If the file is
seen again, a warning message is printed. Otherwise, the new file name is
pushed onto the stack and processing continues.

   <p>Finally, when <code>getline</code> encounters the end of the input file, the file
is closed and the stack is popped.  When <code>stackptr</code> is less than zero,
the program is done:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/igawk.sh -->
         stackptr = 0
         input[stackptr] = ARGV[1] # ARGV[1] is first file
     
         for (; stackptr &gt;= 0; stackptr--) {
             while ((getline &lt; input[stackptr]) &gt; 0) {
                 if (tolower($1) != "@include") {
                     print
                     continue
                 }
                 fpath = pathto($2)
                 if (fpath == "") {
                     printf("igawk:%s:%d: cannot find %s\n",
                         input[stackptr], FNR, $2) &gt; "/dev/stderr"
                     continue
                 }
                 if (! (fpath in processed)) {
                     processed[fpath] = input[stackptr]
                     input[++stackptr] = fpath  # push onto stack
                 } else
                     print $2, "included in", input[stackptr],
                         "already included in",
                         processed[fpath] &gt; "/dev/stderr"
             }
             close(input[stackptr])
         }
     }'  # close quote ends `expand_prog' variable

</pre>
   <p>The shell construct <var>command</var><span class="samp"> &lt;&lt; </span><var>marker</var> is called a <dfn>here document</dfn>. 
Everything in the shell script up to the <var>marker</var> is fed to <var>command</var> as input. 
The shell processes the contents of the here document for variable and command substitution
(and possibly other things as well, depending upon the shell).

   <p>The shell construct <span class="samp">`...`</span> is called <dfn>command substitution</dfn>. 
The output of the command between the two backquotes (grave accents) is substituted
into the command line.  It is saved as a single string, even if the results
contain whitespace.

   <p>The expanded program is saved in the variable <code>processed_program</code>. 
It's done in these steps:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Run <span class="command">gawk</span> with the <span class="samp">@include</span>-processing program (the
value of the <code>expand_prog</code> shell variable) on standard input.

     <li>Standard input is the contents of the user's program, from the shell variable <code>program</code>. 
Its contents are fed to <span class="command">gawk</span> via a here document.

     <li>The results of this processing are saved in the shell variable <code>processed_program</code> by using command substitution.
        </ol>

   <p>The last step is to call <span class="command">gawk</span> with the expanded program,
along with the original
options and command-line arguments that the user supplied.

<!-- this causes more problems than it solves, so leave it out. -->
<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/prog/igawk.sh -->
     eval gawk $opts -- '"$processed_program"' '"$@"'
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>
   <p>The <span class="command">eval</span> command is a shell construct that reruns the shell's parsing
process.  This keeps things properly quoted.

   <p>This version of <span class="command">igawk</span> represents my fourth attempt at this program. 
There are four key simplifications that make the program work better:

     <ul>
<li>Using <span class="samp">@include</span> even for the files named with <span class="option">-f</span> makes building
the initial collected <span class="command">awk</span> program much simpler; all the
<span class="samp">@include</span> processing can be done once.

     <li>Not trying to save the line read with <code>getline</code>
in the <code>pathto</code> function when testing for the
file's accessibility for use with the main program simplifies things
considerably. 
<!-- what problem does this engender though - exercise -->
<!-- answer, reading from "-" or /dev/stdin -->

     <li>Using a <code>getline</code> loop in the <code>BEGIN</code> rule does it all in one
place.  It is not necessary to call out to a separate loop for processing
nested <span class="samp">@include</span> statements.

     <li>Instead of saving the expanded program in a temporary file, putting it in a shell variable
avoids some potential security problems. 
This has the disadvantage that the script relies upon more features
of the <span class="command">sh</span> language, making it harder to follow for those who
aren't familiar with <span class="command">sh</span>. 
</ul>

   <p>Also, this program illustrates that it is often worthwhile to combine
<span class="command">sh</span> and <span class="command">awk</span> programming together.  You can usually
accomplish quite a lot, without having to resort to low-level programming
in C or C++, and it is frequently easier to do certain kinds of string
and argument manipulation using the shell than it is in <span class="command">awk</span>.

   <p>Finally, <span class="command">igawk</span> shows that it is not always necessary to add new
features to a program; they can often be layered on top.  With <span class="command">igawk</span>,
there is no real reason to build <span class="samp">@include</span> processing into
<span class="command">gawk</span> itself.

files in a directory in the search path:

     <dl>
<dt><span class="file">default.awk</span><dd>This file contains a set of default library functions, such
as <code>getopt</code> and <code>assert</code>.

     <br><dt><span class="file">site.awk</span><dd>This file contains library functions that are specific to a site or
installation; i.e., locally developed functions. 
Having a separate file allows <span class="file">default.awk</span> to change with
new <span class="command">gawk</span> releases, without requiring the system administrator to
update it each time by adding the local functions. 
</dl>

   <p>One user
<!-- Karl Berry, karl@ileaf.com, 10/95 -->
suggested that <span class="command">gawk</span> be modified to automatically read these files
upon startup.  Instead, it would be very simple to modify <span class="command">igawk</span>
to do this. Since <span class="command">igawk</span> can process nested <span class="samp">@include</span>
directives, <span class="file">default.awk</span> could simply contain <span class="samp">@include</span>
statements for the desired library functions.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A The Evolution of the <span class="command">awk</span> Language</h2>

<p>This Web page describes the GNU implementation of <span class="command">awk</span>, which follows
the POSIX specification. 
Many long-time <span class="command">awk</span> users learned <span class="command">awk</span> programming
with the original <span class="command">awk</span> implementation in Version 7 Unix. 
(This implementation was the basis for <span class="command">awk</span> in Berkeley Unix,
through 4.3-Reno.  Subsequent versions of Berkeley Unix, and systems
derived from 4.4BSD-Lite, use various versions of <span class="command">gawk</span>
for their <span class="command">awk</span>.) 
This chapter briefly describes the
evolution of the <span class="command">awk</span> language, with cross-references to other parts
of the Web page where you can find more information.

The <span class="command">awk</span> language evolved considerably between the release of
Version 7 Unix (1978) and the new version that was first made generally available in
System V Release 3.1 (1987).  This section summarizes the changes, with
cross-references to further details:

     <ul>
<li>The requirement for <span class="samp">;</span> to separate rules on a line
(see <a href="#Statements_002fLines">Statements/Lines</a>).

     <li>User-defined functions and the <code>return</code> statement
(see <a href="#User_002ddefined">User-defined</a>).

     <li>The <code>delete</code> statement (see <a href="#Delete">Delete</a>).

     <li>The <code>do</code>-<code>while</code> statement
(see <a href="#Do-Statement">Do Statement</a>).

     <li>The built-in functions <code>atan2</code>, <code>cos</code>, <code>sin</code>, <code>rand</code>, and
<code>srand</code> (see <a href="#Numeric-Functions">Numeric Functions</a>).

     <li>The built-in functions <code>gsub</code>, <code>sub</code>, and <code>match</code>
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>).

     <li>The built-in functions <code>close</code> and <code>system</code>
(see <a href="#I_002fO-Functions">I/O Functions</a>).

     <li>The <code>ARGC</code>, <code>ARGV</code>, <code>FNR</code>, <code>RLENGTH</code>, <code>RSTART</code>,
and <code>SUBSEP</code> built-in variables (see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>).

     <li>Assignable <code>$0</code>.

     <li>The conditional expression using the ternary operator <span class="samp">?:</span>
(see <a href="#Conditional-Exp">Conditional Exp</a>).

     <li>The expression <var>index</var><span class="samp"> in </span><var>array</var> outside of <span class="samp">for</span>
statements (see <a href="#Reference-to-Elements">Reference to Elements</a>).

     <li>The exponentiation operator <span class="samp">^</span>
(see <a href="#Arithmetic-Ops">Arithmetic Ops</a>) and its assignment operator
form <span class="samp">^=</span> (see <a href="#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Ops</a>).

     <li>C-compatible operator precedence, which breaks some old <span class="command">awk</span>
programs (see <a href="#Precedence">Precedence</a>).

     <li>Regexps as the value of <code>FS</code>
(see <a href="#Field-Separators">Field Separators</a>) and as the
third argument to the <code>split</code> function
(see <a href="#String-Functions">String Functions</a>), rather than using only the first character
of <code>FS</code>.

     <li>Dynamic regexps as operands of the <span class="samp">~</span> and <span class="samp">!~</span> operators
(see <a href="#Regexp-Usage">Regexp Usage</a>).

     <li>The escape sequences <span class="samp">\b</span>, <span class="samp">\f</span>, and <span class="samp">\r</span>
(see <a href="#Escape-Sequences">Escape Sequences</a>). 
(Some vendors have updated their old versions of <span class="command">awk</span> to
recognize <span class="samp">\b</span>, <span class="samp">\f</span>, and <span class="samp">\r</span>, but this is not
something you can rely on.)

     <li>Redirection of input for the <code>getline</code> function
(see <a href="#Getline">Getline</a>).

     <li>Multiple <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>).

     <li>Multidimensional arrays
(see <a href="#Multi_002ddimensional">Multi-dimensional</a>).

     <ul>
<li>The use of <span class="option">-W</span> for implementation-specific options
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>).

     <li>The use of <code>CONVFMT</code> for controlling the conversion of numbers
to strings (see <a href="#Conversion">Conversion</a>).

     <li>The concept of a numeric string and tighter comparison rules to go
with it (see <a href="#Typing-and-Comparison">Typing and Comparison</a>).

     <li>More complete documentation of many of the previously undocumented
features of the language. 
</ul>

   <p>The following common extensions are not permitted by the POSIX
standard:

<!-- IMPORTANT! Keep this list in sync with the one in node Options -->
<ul>
<li><code>\x</code> escape sequences are not recognized
(see <a href="#Escape-Sequences">Escape Sequences</a>).

     <li>Newlines do not act as whitespace to separate fields when <code>FS</code> is
equal to a single space
(see <a href="#Fields">Fields</a>).

     <li>Newlines are not allowed after <span class="samp">?</span> or <span class="samp">:</span>
(see <a href="#Conditional-Exp">Conditional Exp</a>).

     <li>The synonym <code>func</code> for the keyword <code>function</code> is not
recognized (see <a href="#Definition-Syntax">Definition Syntax</a>).

     <li>The operators <span class="samp">**</span> and <span class="samp">**=</span> cannot be used in
place of <span class="samp">^</span> and <span class="samp">^=</span> (see <a href="#Arithmetic-Ops">Arithmetic Ops</a>,
and <a href="#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Ops</a>).

     <li>Specifying <span class="samp">-Ft</span> on the command line does not set the value
of <code>FS</code> to be a single TAB character
(see <a href="#Field-Separators">Field Separators</a>).

     <li>The locale's decimal point character is used for parsing input
data (see <a href="#Locales">Locales</a>).

     <li>The <code>fflush</code> built-in function is not supported
(see <a href="#I_002fO-Functions">I/O Functions</a>).

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">B.1.2 Extracting the Distribution</h4>

<p><span class="command">gawk</span> is distributed as a <code>tar</code> file compressed with the
GNU Zip program, <code>gzip</code>.

   <p>Once you have the distribution (for example,
<span class="file">gawk-3.1.6.tar.gz</span>),
use <code>gzip</code> to expand the
file and then use <code>tar</code> to extract it.  You can use the following
pipeline to produce the <span class="command">gawk</span> distribution:

<pre class="example">     # Under System V, add 'o' to the tar options
     gzip -d -c gawk-3.1.6.tar.gz | tar -xvpf -
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This creates a directory named <span class="file">gawk-3.1.6</span>
in the current directory.

   <p>The distribution file name is of the form
<span class="file">gawk-</span><var>V</var><span class="file">.</span><var>R</var><span class="file">.</span><var>P</var><span class="file">.tar.gz</span>. 
The <var>V</var> represents the major version of <span class="command">gawk</span>,
the <var>R</var> represents the current release of version <var>V</var>, and
the <var>P</var> represents a <dfn>patch level</dfn>, meaning that minor bugs have
been fixed in the release.  The current patch level is 6,
but when retrieving distributions, you should get the version with the highest
version, release, and patch level.  (Note, however, that patch levels greater than
or equal to 80 denote &ldquo;beta&rdquo; or nonproduction software; you might not want
to retrieve such a version unless you don't mind experimenting.) 
If you are not on a Unix system, you need to make other arrangements
for getting and extracting the <span class="command">gawk</span> distribution.  You should consult
a local expert.

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">B.2.1 Compiling <span class="command">gawk</span> for Unix</h4>

<!-- @cindex installation, unix -->
<p>After you have extracted the <span class="command">gawk</span> distribution, <span class="command">cd</span>
to <span class="file">gawk-3.1.6</span>.  Like most GNU software,
<span class="command">gawk</span> is configured
automatically for your Unix system by running the <span class="command">configure</span> program. 
This program is a Bourne shell script that is generated automatically using
GNU <span class="command">autoconf</span>. 
(The <span class="command">autoconf</span> software is
described fully in
<cite>Autoconf&mdash;Generating Automatic Configuration Scripts</cite>,
which is available from the Free Software Foundation.)

   <p>To configure <span class="command">gawk</span>, simply run <span class="command">configure</span>:

<pre class="example">     sh ./configure
</pre>
   <p>This produces a <span class="file">Makefile</span> and <span class="file">config.h</span> tailored to your system. 
The <span class="file">config.h</span> file describes various facts about your system. 
You might want to edit the <span class="file">Makefile</span> to
change the <code>CFLAGS</code> variable, which controls
the command-line options that are passed to the C compiler (such as
optimization levels or compiling for debugging).

   <p>Alternatively, you can add your own values for most <span class="command">make</span>
variables on the command line, such as <code>CC</code> and <code>CFLAGS</code>, when
running <span class="command">configure</span>:

<pre class="example">     CC=cc CFLAGS=-g sh ./configure
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">See the file <span class="file">INSTALL</span> in the <span class="command">gawk</span> distribution for
all the details.

   <p>After you have run <span class="command">configure</span> and possibly edited the <span class="file">Makefile</span>,
type:

<pre class="example">     make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Shortly thereafter, you should have an executable version of <span class="command">gawk</span>. 
That's all there is to it! 
To verify that <span class="command">gawk</span> is working properly,
run <span class="samp">make check</span>.  All of the tests should succeed. 
If these steps do not work, or if any of the tests fail,
check the files in the <span class="file">README_d</span> directory to see if you've
found a known problem.  If the failure is not described there,
please send in a bug report
(see <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>.)

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">B.2.3 The Configuration Process</h4>

<p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-configuring-1897"></a>This section is of interest only if you know something about using the
C language and the Unix operating system.

   <p>The source code for <span class="command">gawk</span> generally attempts to adhere to formal
standards wherever possible.  This means that <span class="command">gawk</span> uses library
routines that are specified by the ISO C standard and by the POSIX
operating system interface standard.  When using an ISO C compiler,
function prototypes are used to help improve the compile-time checking.

   <p>Many Unix systems do not support all of either the ISO or the
POSIX standards.  The <span class="file">missing_d</span> subdirectory in the <span class="command">gawk</span>
distribution contains replacement versions of those functions that are
most likely to be missing.

   <p>The <span class="file">config.h</span> file that <span class="command">configure</span> creates contains
definitions that describe features of the particular operating system
where you are attempting to compile <span class="command">gawk</span>.  The three things
described by this file are: what header files are available, so that
they can be correctly included, what (supposedly) standard functions
are actually available in your C libraries, and various miscellaneous
facts about your variant of Unix.  For example, there may not be an

<span class="samp">HAVE_ST_BLKSIZE</span> is undefined.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bcustom_002eh_007d-file-1898"></a>It is possible for your C compiler to lie to <span class="command">configure</span>. It may
do so by not exiting with an error when a library function is not
available.  To get around this, edit the file <span class="file">custom.h</span>. 
Use an <span class="samp">#ifdef</span> that is appropriate for your system, and either
<code>#define</code> any constants that <span class="command">configure</span> should have defined but
didn't, or <code>#undef</code> any constants that <span class="command">configure</span> defined and
should not have.  <span class="file">custom.h</span> is automatically included by
<span class="file">config.h</span>.

   <p>It is also possible that the <span class="command">configure</span> program generated by
<span class="command">autoconf</span> will not work on your system in some other fashion. 
If you do have a problem, the file <span class="file">configure.in</span> is the input for
<span class="command">autoconf</span>.  You may be able to change this file and generate a
new version of <span class="command">configure</span> that works on your system
(see <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>,
for information on how to report problems in configuring <span class="command">gawk</span>). 
The same mechanism may be used to send in updates to <span class="file">configure.in</span>
and/or <span class="file">custom.h</span>.

<p><a name="index-amiga-1899"></a><a name="index-installation_002c-amiga-1900"></a>You can install <span class="command">gawk</span> on an Amiga system using a Unix emulation
environment, available via anonymous <span class="command">ftp</span> from
<code>ftp.ninemoons.com</code> in the directory <span class="file">pub/ade/current</span>. 
This includes a shell based on <span class="command">pdksh</span>.  The primary component of
this environment is a Unix emulation library, <span class="file">ixemul.lib</span>. 
<!-- could really use more background here, who wrote this, etc. -->

   <p>A more complete distribution for the Amiga is available on
the Geek Gadgets CD-ROM, available from:

<!-- From email contributed by Martin Brown, mc@whoever.com -->
Since BeOS DR9, all the tools that you should need to build <code>gawk</code> are
included with BeOS. The process is basically identical to the Unix process
of running <span class="command">configure</span> and then <span class="command">make</span>. Full instructions are given below.

   <p>You can compile <span class="command">gawk</span> under BeOS by extracting the standard sources
and running <span class="command">configure</span>. You <em>must</em> specify the location
prefix for the installation directory. For BeOS DR9 and beyond, the best directory to
use is <span class="file">/boot/home/config</span>, so the <span class="command">configure</span> command is:

<pre class="example">     configure --prefix=/boot/home/config
</pre>
   <p>This installs the compiled application into <span class="file">/boot/home/config/bin</span>,
which is already specified in the standard <span class="env">PATH</span>.

   <p>Once the configuration process is completed, you can run <span class="command">make</span>,
and then <span class="samp">make install</span>:

<pre class="example">     $ make
     ...
     $ make install
</pre>
   <p>BeOS uses <span class="command">bash</span> as its shell; thus, you use <span class="command">gawk</span> the same way you would
under Unix. 
If these steps do not work, please send in a bug report
(see <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>).

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">B.3.3.1 Installing a Prepared Distribution for PC Systems</h5>

<p>If you have received a binary distribution prepared by the DOS
maintainers, then <span class="command">gawk</span> and the necessary support files appear
under the <span class="file">gnu</span> directory, with executables in <span class="file">gnu/bin</span>,
libraries in <span class="file">gnu/lib/awk</span>, and manual pages under <span class="file">gnu/man</span>. 
This is designed for easy installation to a <span class="file">/gnu</span> directory on your
drive&mdash;however, the files can be installed anywhere provided <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> is
set properly.  Regardless of the installation directory, the first line of
<span class="file">igawk.cmd</span> and <span class="file">igawk.bat</span> (in <span class="file">gnu/bin</span>) may need to be
edited.

   <p>The binary distribution contains a separate file describing the
contents. In particular, it may include more than one version of the
<span class="command">gawk</span> executable.

   <p>OS/2 (32 bit, EMX) binary distributions are prepared for the <span class="file">/usr</span>
directory of your preferred drive. Set <span class="env">UNIXROOT</span> to your installation
drive (e.g., <span class="samp">e:</span>) if you want to install <span class="command">gawk</span> onto another drive
than the hardcoded default <span class="samp">c:</span>. Executables appear in <span class="file">/usr/bin</span>,
libraries under <span class="file">/usr/share/awk</span>, manual pages under <span class="file">/usr/man</span>,
Texinfo documentation under <span class="file">/usr/info</span> and NLS files under <span class="file">/usr/share/locale</span>. 
If you already have a file <span class="file">/usr/info/dir</span> from another package
<em>do not overwrite it!</em> Instead enter the following commands at your prompt
(replace <span class="samp">x:</span> by your installation drive):

<pre class="example">     install-info --info-dir=x:/usr/info x:/usr/info/gawk.info
     install-info --info-dir=x:/usr/info x:/usr/info/gawkinet.info
</pre>
   <p>However, the files can be installed anywhere provided <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> is
set properly.

   <p>The binary distribution may contain a separate file containing additional
or more detailed installation instructions.

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">B.3.3.2 Compiling <span class="command">gawk</span> for PC Operating Systems</h5>

<p><span class="command">gawk</span> can be compiled for MS-DOS, Windows32, and OS/2 using the GNU
development tools from DJ Delorie (DJGPP; MS-DOS only) or Eberhard
Mattes (EMX; MS-DOS, Windows32 and OS/2).  Microsoft Visual C/C++ can be used
to build a Windows32 version, and Microsoft C/C++ can be
used to build 16-bit versions for MS-DOS and OS/2. 
<!-- FIXME: -->
(As of <span class="command">gawk</span> 3.1.2, the MSC version doesn't work. However,
the maintainer is working on fixing it.) 
The file
<span class="file">README_d/README.pc</span> in the <span class="command">gawk</span> distribution contains
additional notes, and <span class="file">pc/Makefile</span> contains important information on
compilation options.

   <p>To build <span class="command">gawk</span> for MS-DOS, Windows32, and OS/2 (16 bit only; for 32 bit
(EMX) you can use the <span class="command">configure</span> script and skip the following paragraphs;
for details see below), copy the files in the <span class="file">pc</span> directory (<em>except</em>
for <span class="file">ChangeLog</span>) to the directory with the rest of the <span class="command">gawk</span>
sources. The <span class="file">Makefile</span> contains a configuration section with comments and
may need to be edited in order to work with your <span class="command">make</span> utility.

   <p>The <span class="file">Makefile</span> contains a number of targets for building various MS-DOS,
Windows32, and OS/2 versions. A list of targets is printed if the <span class="command">make</span>
command is given without a target. As an example, to build <span class="command">gawk</span>
using the DJGPP tools, enter <span class="samp">make djgpp</span>. 
(The DJGPP tools may be found at
<a href="ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2gnu/">ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2gnu/</a>.)

   <p>Using <span class="command">make</span> to run the standard tests and to install <span class="command">gawk</span>
requires additional Unix-like tools, including <span class="command">sh</span>, <span class="command">sed</span>, and
<span class="command">cp</span>. In order to run the tests, the <span class="file">test/*.ok</span> files may need to
be converted so that they have the usual DOS-style end-of-line markers. Most
of the tests work properly with Stewartson's shell along with the
companion utilities or appropriate GNU utilities.  However, some editing of
<span class="file">test/Makefile</span> is required. It is recommended that you copy the file
<span class="file">pc/Makefile.tst</span> over the file <span class="file">test/Makefile</span> as a
replacement. Details can be found in <span class="file">README_d/README.pc</span>
and in the file <span class="file">pc/Makefile.tst</span>.

   <p>The 32 bit EMX version of <span class="command">gawk</span> works &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; under OS/2. 
In principle, it is possible to compile <span class="command">gawk</span> the following way:

<pre class="example">     $ ./configure
     $ make
</pre>
   <p>This is not recommended, though. To get an OMF executable you should
use the following commands at your <span class="command">sh</span> prompt:

<pre class="example">     $ CPPFLAGS="-D__ST_MT_ERRNO__"
     $ export CPPFLAGS
     $ CFLAGS="-O2 -Zomf -Zmt"
     $ export CFLAGS
     $ LDFLAGS="-s -Zcrtdll -Zlinker /exepack:2 -Zlinker /pm:vio -Zstack 0x6000"
     $ export LDFLAGS
     $ RANLIB="echo"
     $ export RANLIB
     $ ./configure --prefix=c:/usr --without-included-gettext
     $ make AR=emxomfar
</pre>
   <p>These are just suggestions. You may use any other set of (self-consistent)
environment variables and compiler flags.

   <p>To get an FHS-compliant file hierarchy it is recommended to use the additional
<span class="command">configure</span> options <span class="option">--infodir=c:/usr/share/info</span>, <span class="option">--mandir=c:/usr/share/man</span>
and <span class="option">--libexecdir=c:/usr/lib</span>.

   <p>If you use GCC 2.95 it is recommended to use also:

<pre class="example">     $ LIBS="-lgcc"
     $ export LIBS
</pre>
   <p>You can also get an <code>a.out</code> executable if you prefer:

<pre class="example">     $ CPPFLAGS="-D__ST_MT_ERRNO__"
     $ export CPPFLAGS
     $ CFLAGS="-O2 -Zmt"
     $ export CFLAGS
     $ LDFLAGS="-s -Zstack 0x6000"
     $ LIBS="-lgcc"
     $ unset RANLIB
     <!-- $ ./configure -prefix=c:/usr -without-included-gettext -->
     $ ./configure --prefix=c:/usr
     $ make
</pre>
   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> Versions later than GCC 2.95, i.e., GCC 3.x using the Innotek libc were not tested. 
</blockquote>

   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> Even if the compiled <span class="command">gawk.exe</span> (<code>a.out</code>) executable
contains a DOS header, it does <em>not</em> work under DOS. To compile an executable
that runs under DOS, <code>"-DPIPES_SIMULATED"</code> must be added to <span class="env">CPPFLAGS</span>. 
But then some nonstandard extensions of <span class="command">gawk</span> (e.g., <span class="samp">|&amp;</span>) do not work! 
</blockquote>

   <p>After compilation the internal tests can be performed. Enter
<span class="samp">make check CMP="diff -a"</span> at your command prompt. All tests
except for the <code>pid</code> test are expected to work properly. 
The <code>pid</code> test fails because child processes are not started by
<code>fork()</code>.

   <p><span class="samp">make install</span> works as expected.

   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> Most OS/2 ports of GNU <span class="command">make</span> are not able to handle
the Makefiles of this package. If you encounter any problems with <span class="command">make</span>
try GNU Make 3.79.1 or later versions. You should find the latest
version on <a href="http://www.unixos2.org/sw/pub/binary/make/">http://www.unixos2.org/sw/pub/binary/make/</a> or on
<a href="ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/">ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/</a>.

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">B.3.3.3 Compiling <span class="command">gawk</span> For Dynamic Libraries</h5>

<!-- From README_d/README.pcdynamic -->
<!-- 11 June 2003 -->
<p>To compile <span class="command">gawk</span> with dynamic extension support,
uncomment the definitions of <code>DYN_FLAGS</code>, <code>DYN_EXP</code>,
<code>DYN_OBJ</code>, and <code>DYN_MAKEXP</code> in the configuration section of
the <span class="file">Makefile</span>. There are two definitions for <code>DYN_MAKEXP</code>:
pick the one that matches your target.

   <p>To build some of the example extension libraries, <span class="command">cd</span> to the
extension directory and copy <span class="file">Makefile.pc</span> to <span class="file">Makefile</span>. You
can then build using the same two targets. To run the example
<span class="command">awk</span> scripts, you'll need to either change the call to
the <code>extension</code> function to match the name of the library (for
instance, change <code>"./ordchr.so"</code> to <code>"ordchr.dll"</code> or simply
<code>"ordchr"</code>), or rename the library to match the call (for instance,
rename <span class="file">ordchr.dll</span> to <span class="file">ordchr.so</span>).

   <p>If you build <span class="command">gawk.exe</span> with one compiler but want to build
an extension library with the other, you need to copy the import
library. Visual C uses a library called <span class="file">gawk.lib</span>, while MinGW uses
a library called <span class="file">libgawk.a</span>. These files are equivalent and will
interoperate if you give them the correct name.  The resulting shared
libraries are also interoperable.

   <p>To create your own extension library, you can use the examples as models,
but you're essentially on your own. Post to <code>comp.lang.awk</code> or
send electronic mail to <a href="mailto:ptjm@interlog.com">ptjm@interlog.com</a> if you have problems getting
started. If you need to access functions or variables which are not
exported by <span class="command">gawk.exe</span>, add them to <span class="file">gawkw32.def</span> and
rebuild. You should also add <code>ATTRIBUTE_EXPORTED</code> to the declaration
in <span class="file">awk.h</span> of any variables you add to <span class="file">gawkw32.def</span>.

   <p>Note that extension libraries have the name of the <span class="command">awk</span>
executable embedded in them at link time, so they will work only
with <span class="command">gawk.exe</span>. In particular, they won't work if you
rename <span class="command">gawk.exe</span> to <span class="command">awk.exe</span> or if you try to use
<span class="command">pgawk.exe</span>. You can perform profiling by temporarily renaming
<span class="command">pgawk.exe</span> to <span class="command">gawk.exe</span>. You can resolve this problem
by changing the program name in the definition of <code>DYN_MAKEXP</code>
for your compiler.

   <p>On Windows32, libraries are sought first in the current directory, then in
the directory containing <span class="command">gawk.exe</span>, and finally through the
<span class="env">PATH</span> environment variable.

the <span class="samp">|&amp;</span> operator and TCP/IP networking
(see <a href="#TCP_002fIP-Networking">TCP/IP Networking</a>)

described in <a href="#AWKPATH-Variable">AWKPATH Variable</a>. 
However, semicolons (rather than colons) separate elements
in the <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> variable. If <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> is not set or is empty,
then the default search path for OS/2 (16 bit) and MS-DOS versions is
<code>".;c:/lib/awk;c:/gnu/lib/awk"<!-- /@w --></code>.

   <p>The search path for OS/2 (32 bit, EMX) is determined by the prefix directory
(most likely <span class="file">/usr</span> or <span class="file">c:/usr</span>) that has been specified as an option of
the <span class="command">configure</span> script like it is the case for the Unix versions. 
If <span class="file">c:/usr</span> is the prefix directory then the default search path contains <span class="file">.</span>
and <span class="file">c:/usr/share/awk</span>. 
Additionally, to support binary distributions of <span class="command">gawk</span> for OS/2
systems whose drive <span class="samp">c:</span> might not support long file names or might not exist
at all, there is a special environment variable. If <span class="env">UNIXROOT</span> specifies
a drive then this specific drive is also searched for program files. 
E.g., if <span class="env">UNIXROOT</span> is set to <span class="file">e:</span> the complete default search path is
<code>".;c:/usr/share/awk;e:/usr/share/awk"<!-- /@w --></code>.

   <p>An <span class="command">sh</span>-like shell (as opposed to <span class="command">command.com</span> under MS-DOS
or <span class="command">cmd.exe</span> under OS/2) may be useful for <span class="command">awk</span> programming. 
Ian Stewartson has written an excellent shell for MS-DOS and OS/2,
Daisuke Aoyama has ported GNU <span class="command">bash</span> to MS-DOS using the DJGPP tools,
and several shells are available for OS/2, including <span class="command">ksh</span>.  The file
<span class="file">README_d/README.pc</span> in the <span class="command">gawk</span> distribution contains
information on these shells.  Users of Stewartson's shell on DOS should
examine its documentation for handling command lines; in particular,
the setting for <span class="command">gawk</span> in the shell configuration may need to be
changed and the <code>ignoretype</code> option may also be of interest.

   <p><a name="index-differences-in-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-_0040code_007bBINMODE_007d-variable-1913"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bBINMODE_007d-variable-1914"></a>Under OS/2 and DOS, <span class="command">gawk</span> (and many other text programs) silently
translate end-of-line <code>"\r\n"</code> to <code>"\n"</code> on input and <code>"\n"</code>
to <code>"\r\n"</code> on output.  A special <code>BINMODE</code> variable allows
control over these translations and is interpreted as follows:

     <ul>
<li>If <code>BINMODE</code> is <span class="samp">"r"</span>, or
<code>(BINMODE &amp; 1)</code> is nonzero, then
binary mode is set on read (i.e., no translations on reads).

     <li>If <code>BINMODE</code> is <code>"w"</code>, or
<code>(BINMODE &amp; 2)</code> is nonzero, then
binary mode is set on write (i.e., no translations on writes).

     <li>If <code>BINMODE</code> is <code>"rw"</code> or <code>"wr"</code>,
binary mode is set for both read and write
(same as <code>(BINMODE &amp; 3)</code>).

     <li><code>BINMODE=</code><var>non-null-string</var> is
the same as <span class="samp">BINMODE=3</span> (i.e., no translations on
reads or writes).  However, <span class="command">gawk</span> issues a warning
message if the string is not one of <code>"rw"</code> or <code>"wr"</code>. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The modes for standard input and standard output are set one time
only (after the
command line is read, but before processing any of the <span class="command">awk</span> program). 
Setting <code>BINMODE</code> for standard input or
standard output is accomplished by using an
appropriate <span class="samp">-v BINMODE=</span><var>N</var> option on the command line. 
<code>BINMODE</code> is set at the time a file or pipe is opened and cannot be
changed mid-stream.

   <p>The name <code>BINMODE</code> was chosen to match <span class="command">mawk</span>
(see <a href="#Other-Versions">Other Versions</a>). 
Both <span class="command">mawk</span> and <span class="command">gawk</span> handle <code>BINMODE</code> similarly; however,
<span class="command">mawk</span> adds a <span class="samp">-W BINMODE=</span><var>N</var> option and an environment
variable that can set <code>BINMODE</code>, <code>RS</code>, and <code>ORS</code>.  The
files <span class="file">binmode[1-3].awk</span> (under <span class="file">gnu/lib/awk</span> in some of the
prepared distributions) have been chosen to match <span class="command">mawk</span>'s <span class="samp">-W
BINMODE=</span><var>N</var> option.  These can be changed or discarded; in particular,
the setting of <code>RS</code> giving the fewest &ldquo;surprises&rdquo; is open to debate. 
<span class="command">mawk</span> uses <span class="samp">RS = "\r\n"</span> if binary mode is set on read, which is
appropriate for files with the DOS-style end-of-line.

   <p>To illustrate, the following examples set binary mode on writes for standard
output and other files, and set <code>ORS</code> as the &ldquo;usual&rdquo; DOS-style
end-of-line:

<pre class="example">     gawk -v BINMODE=2 -v ORS="\r\n" ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or:

<pre class="example">     gawk -v BINMODE=w -f binmode2.awk ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">These give the same result as the <span class="samp">-W BINMODE=2</span> option in
<span class="command">mawk</span>. 
The following changes the record separator to <code>"\r\n"</code> and sets binary
mode on reads, but does not affect the mode on standard input:

<pre class="example">     gawk -v RS="\r\n" --source "BEGIN { BINMODE = 1 }" ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or:

<pre class="example">     gawk -f binmode1.awk ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">With proper quoting, in the first example the setting of <code>RS</code> can be
moved into the <code>BEGIN</code> rule.

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">B.3.4.1 Compiling <span class="command">gawk</span> on VMS</h5>

<p>To compile <span class="command">gawk</span> under VMS, there is a <code>DCL</code> command procedure that
issues all the necessary <code>CC</code> and <code>LINK</code> commands. There is
also a <span class="file">Makefile</span> for use with the <code>MMS</code> utility.  From the source
directory, use either:

<pre class="example">     $ @[.VMS]VMSBUILD.COM
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or:

<pre class="example">     $ MMS/DESCRIPTION=[.VMS]DESCRIP.MMS GAWK
</pre>
   <p>Depending upon which C compiler you are using, follow one of the sets
of instructions in this table:

     <dl>
<dt>VAX C V3.x<dd>Use either <span class="file">vmsbuild.com</span> or <span class="file">descrip.mms</span> as is.  These use
<code>CC/OPTIMIZE=NOLINE</code>, which is essential for Version 3.0.

     <br><dt>VAX C V2.x<dd>You must have Version 2.3 or 2.4; older ones won't work.  Edit either
<span class="file">vmsbuild.com</span> or <span class="file">descrip.mms</span> according to the comments in them. 
For <span class="file">vmsbuild.com</span>, this just entails removing two <span class="samp">!</span> delimiters. 
Also edit <span class="file">config.h</span> (which is a copy of file <span class="file">[.config]vms-conf.h</span>)
and comment out or delete the two lines <span class="samp">#define __STDC__ 0</span> and
<span class="samp">#define VAXC_BUILTINS</span> near the end.

     <br><dt>GNU C<dd>Edit <span class="file">vmsbuild.com</span> or <span class="file">descrip.mms</span>; the changes are different
from those for VAX C V2.x but equally straightforward.  No changes to
<span class="file">config.h</span> are needed.

     <br><dt>DEC C<dd>Edit <span class="file">vmsbuild.com</span> or <span class="file">descrip.mms</span> according to their comments. 
No changes to <span class="file">config.h</span> are needed. 
</dl>

   <p><span class="command">gawk</span> has been tested under VAX/VMS 5.5-1 using VAX C V3.2, and
GNU C 1.40 and 2.3.  It should work without modifications for VMS V4.6 and up.

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">B.3.4.2 Installing <span class="command">gawk</span> on VMS</h5>

<p>To install <span class="command">gawk</span>, all you need is a &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; command, which is
a <code>DCL</code> symbol whose value begins with a dollar sign. For example:

<pre class="example">     $ GAWK :== $disk1:[gnubin]GAWK
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Substitute the actual location of <span class="command">gawk.exe</span> for
<span class="samp">$disk1:[gnubin]</span>. The symbol should be placed in the
<span class="file">login.com</span> of any user who wants to run <span class="command">gawk</span>,
so that it is defined every time the user logs on. 
Alternatively, the symbol may be placed in the system-wide
<span class="file">sylogin.com</span> procedure, which allows all users
to run <span class="command">gawk</span>.

   <p>Optionally, the help entry can be loaded into a VMS help library:

<pre class="example">     $ LIBRARY/HELP SYS$HELP:HELPLIB [.VMS]GAWK.HLP
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(You may want to substitute a site-specific help library rather than
the standard VMS library <span class="samp">HELPLIB</span>.)  After loading the help text,
the command:

<pre class="example">     $ HELP GAWK
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">provides information about both the <span class="command">gawk</span> implementation and the
<span class="command">awk</span> programming language.

   <p>The logical name <span class="samp">AWK_LIBRARY</span> can designate a default location
for <span class="command">awk</span> program files.  For the <span class="option">-f</span> option, if the specified
file name has no device or directory path information in it, <span class="command">gawk</span>
looks in the current directory first, then in the directory specified
by the translation of <span class="samp">AWK_LIBRARY</span> if the file is not found. 
If, after searching in both directories, the file still is not found,
<span class="command">gawk</span> appends the suffix <span class="samp">.awk</span> to the filename and retries
the file search.  If <span class="samp">AWK_LIBRARY</span> is not defined, that
portion of the file search fails benignly.

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">B.3.4.3 Running <span class="command">gawk</span> on VMS</h5>

<p>Command-line parsing and quoting conventions are significantly different
on VMS, so examples in this Web page or from other sources often need minor
changes.  They <em>are</em> minor though, and all <span class="command">awk</span> programs
should run correctly.

   <p>Here are a couple of trivial tests:

<pre class="example">     $ gawk -- "BEGIN {print ""Hello, World!""}"
     $ gawk -"W" version
     ! could also be -"W version" or "-W version"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that uppercase and mixed-case text must be quoted.

   <p>The VMS port of <span class="command">gawk</span> includes a <code>DCL</code>-style interface in addition
to the original shell-style interface (see the help entry for details). 
One side effect of dual command-line parsing is that if there is only a
single parameter (as in the quoted string program above), the command
becomes ambiguous.  To work around this, the normally optional <span class="option">--</span>
flag is required to force Unix style rather than <code>DCL</code> parsing.  If any
other dash-type options (or multiple parameters such as data files to
process) are present, there is no ambiguity and <span class="option">--</span> can be omitted.

<!-- @cindex directory search -->
<!-- @cindex path, search -->
<p><a name="index-search-paths-1916"></a><a name="index-search-paths_002c-for-source-files-1917"></a>The default search path, when looking for <span class="command">awk</span> program files specified
by the <span class="option">-f</span> option, is <code>"SYS$DISK:[],AWK_LIBRARY:"</code>.  The logical
name <span class="samp">AWKPATH</span> can be used to override this default.  The format
of <span class="samp">AWKPATH</span> is a comma-separated list of directory specifications. 
When defining it, the value should be quoted so that it retains a single
translation and not a multitranslation <code>RMS</code> searchlist.

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">B.3.4.4 Building and Using <span class="command">gawk</span> on VMS POSIX</h5>

<p>Ignore the instructions above, although <span class="file">vms/gawk.hlp</span> should still
be made available in a help library.  The source tree should be unpacked
into a container file subsystem rather than into the ordinary VMS filesystem. 
Make sure that the two scripts, <span class="file">configure</span> and
<span class="file">vms/posix-cc.sh</span>, are executable; use <span class="samp">chmod +x</span> on them if
necessary.  Then execute the following two commands:

<pre class="example">     psx&gt; CC=vms/posix-cc.sh configure
     psx&gt; make CC=c89 gawk
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first command constructs files <span class="file">config.h</span> and <span class="file">Makefile</span> out
of templates, using a script to make the C compiler fit <span class="command">configure</span>'s
expectations.  The second command compiles and links <span class="command">gawk</span> using
the C compiler directly; ignore any warnings from <span class="command">make</span> about being
unable to redefine <code>CC</code>.  <span class="command">configure</span> takes a very long
time to execute, but at least it provides incremental feedback as it runs.

   <p>This has been tested with VAX/VMS V6.2, VMS POSIX V2.0, and DEC C V5.2.

   <p>Once built, <span class="command">gawk</span> works like any other shell utility.  Unlike
the normal VMS port of <span class="command">gawk</span>, no special command-line manipulation is
needed in the VMS POSIX environment.

<p>Some versions of VMS have an old version of <span class="command">gawk</span>.  To access it,

<p>The Atari port is no longer supported.  It is
included for those who might want to use it but it is no longer being
actively maintained.

<!-- based on material from Michal Jaegermann <michal@gortel.phys.ualberta.ca> -->
<p><a name="index-atari-1918"></a><a name="index-installation_002c-atari-1919"></a>There are no substantial differences when installing <span class="command">gawk</span> on
various Atari models.  Compiled <span class="command">gawk</span> executables do not require
a large amount of memory with most <span class="command">awk</span> programs, and should run on all
Motorola processor-based models (called further ST, even if that is not
exactly right).

   <p>In order to use <span class="command">gawk</span>, you need to have a shell, either text or
graphics, that does not map all the characters of a command line to
uppercase.  Maintaining case distinction in option flags is very
important (see <a href="#Options">Options</a>). 
These days this is the default and it may only be a problem for some
very old machines.  If your system does not preserve the case of option
flags, you need to upgrade your tools.  Support for I/O
redirection is necessary to make it easy to import <span class="command">awk</span> programs
from other environments.  Pipes are nice to have but not vital.

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">B.4.1.1 Compiling <span class="command">gawk</span> on the Atari ST</h5>

<p>A proper compilation of <span class="command">gawk</span> sources when <code>sizeof(int)</code>
differs from <code>sizeof(void *)</code> requires an ISO C compiler. An initial
port was done with <span class="command">gcc</span>.  You may actually prefer executables
where <code>int</code>s are four bytes wide but the other variant works as well.

   <p>You may need quite a bit of memory when trying to recompile the <span class="command">gawk</span>
sources, as some source files (<span class="file">regex.c</span> in particular) are quite
big.  If you run out of memory compiling such a file, try reducing the
optimization level for this particular file, which may help.

   <p><a name="index-Linux-1920"></a><a name="index-GNU_002fLinux-1921"></a>With a reasonable shell (<span class="command">bash</span> will do), you have a pretty good chance
that the <span class="command">configure</span> utility will succeed, and in particular if
you run GNU/Linux, MiNT or a similar operating system.  Otherwise
sample versions of <span class="file">config.h</span> and <span class="file">Makefile.st</span> are given in the
<span class="file">atari</span> subdirectory and can be edited and copied to the
corresponding files in the main source directory.  Even if
<span class="command">configure</span> produces something, it might be advisable to compare
its results with the sample versions and possibly make adjustments.

   <p>Some <span class="command">gawk</span> source code fragments depend on a preprocessor define
<span class="samp">atarist</span>.  This basically assumes the TOS environment with <span class="command">gcc</span>. 
Modify these sections as appropriate if they are not right for your
environment.  Also see the remarks about <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> and <code>envsep</code> in
<a href="#Atari-Using">Atari Using</a>.

   <p>As shipped, the sample <span class="file">config.h</span> claims that the <code>system</code>
function is missing from the libraries, which is not true, and an
alternative implementation of this function is provided in
<span class="file">unsupported/atari/system.c</span>. 
Depending upon your particular combination of
shell and operating system, you might want to change the file to indicate
that <code>system</code> is available.

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">B.4.1.2 Running <span class="command">gawk</span> on the Atari ST</h5>

<p>An executable version of <span class="command">gawk</span> should be placed, as usual,
anywhere in your <span class="env">PATH</span> where your shell can find it.

   <p>While executing, the Atari version of <span class="command">gawk</span> creates a number of temporary files.  When
using <span class="command">gcc</span> libraries for TOS, <span class="command">gawk</span> looks for either of
the environment variables, <span class="env">TEMP</span> or <span class="env">TMPDIR</span>, in that order. 
If either one is found, its value is assumed to be a directory for
temporary files.  This directory must exist, and if you can spare the
memory, it is a good idea to put it on a RAM drive.  If neither
<span class="env">TEMP</span> nor <span class="env">TMPDIR</span> are found, then <span class="command">gawk</span> uses the
current directory for its temporary files.

   <p>The ST version of <span class="command">gawk</span> searches for its program files, as described in
<a href="#AWKPATH-Variable">AWKPATH Variable</a>. 
The default value for the <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> variable is taken from
<code>DEFPATH</code> defined in <span class="file">Makefile</span>. The sample <span class="command">gcc</span>/TOS
<span class="file">Makefile</span> for the ST in the distribution sets <code>DEFPATH</code> to
<code>".,c:\lib\awk,c:\gnu\lib\awk"<!-- /@w --></code>.  The search path can be
modified by explicitly setting <span class="env">AWKPATH</span> to whatever you want. 
Note that colons cannot be used on the ST to separate elements in the
<span class="env">AWKPATH</span> variable, since they have another reserved meaning. 
Instead, you must use a comma to separate elements in the path.  When
recompiling, the separating character can be modified by initializing
the <code>envsep</code> variable in <span class="file">unsupported/atari/gawkmisc.atr</span> to another
value.

   <p>Although <span class="command">awk</span> allows great flexibility in doing I/O redirections
from within a program, this facility should be used with care on the ST
running under TOS.  In some circumstances, the OS routines for file-handle
pool processing lose track of certain events, causing the
computer to crash and requiring a reboot.  Often a warm reboot is
sufficient.  Fortunately, this happens infrequently and in rather
esoteric situations.  In particular, avoid having one part of an
<span class="command">awk</span> program using <code>print</code> statements explicitly redirected
to <span class="file">/dev/stdout</span>, while other <code>print</code> statements use the
default standard output, and a calling shell has redirected standard
output to a file. 
<!-- 10/2000: Is this still true, now that gawk does /dev/stdout internally? -->

   <p>When <span class="command">gawk</span> is compiled with the ST version of <span class="command">gcc</span> and its
usual libraries, it accepts both <span class="samp">/</span> and <span class="samp">\</span> as path separators. 
While this is convenient, it should be remembered that this removes one
technically valid character (<span class="samp">/</span>) from your file name. 
It may also create problems for external programs called via the <code>system</code>
function, which may not support this convention.  Whenever it is possible
that a file created by <span class="command">gawk</span> will be used by some other program,
use only backslashes.  Also remember that in <span class="command">awk</span>, backslashes in
strings have to be doubled in order to get literal backslashes
(see <a href="#Escape-Sequences">Escape Sequences</a>).

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">B.4.2 Installing <span class="command">gawk</span> on a Tandem</h4>

<p><a name="index-tandem-1922"></a><a name="index-installation_002c-tandem-1923"></a>
The Tandem port is only minimally supported. 
The port's contributor no longer has access to a Tandem system.

<!-- This section based on README.Tandem by Stephen Davies (scldad@sdc.com.au) -->
<p>The Tandem port was done on a Cyclone machine running D20. 
The port is pretty clean and all facilities seem to work except for
the I/O piping facilities
(see <a href="#Getline_002fPipe">Getline/Pipe</a>,
<a href="#Getline_002fVariable_002fPipe">Getline/Variable/Pipe</a>,
and
<a href="#Redirection">Redirection</a>),
which is just too foreign a concept for Tandem.

   <p>To build a Tandem executable from source, download all of the files so
that the file names on the Tandem box conform to the restrictions of D20. 
For example, <span class="file">array.c</span> becomes <span class="file">ARRAYC</span>, and <span class="file">awk.h</span>
becomes <span class="file">AWKH</span>.  The totally Tandem-specific files are in the
<span class="file">tandem</span> &ldquo;subvolume&rdquo; (<span class="file">unsupported/tandem</span> in the <span class="command">gawk</span>
distribution) and should be copied to the main source directory before
building <span class="command">gawk</span>.

   <p>The file <span class="file">compit</span> can then be used to compile and bind an executable. 
Alas, there is no <span class="command">configure</span> or <span class="command">make</span>.

   <p>Usage is the same as for Unix, except that D20 requires all <span class="samp">{</span> and
<span class="samp">}</span> characters to be escaped with <span class="samp">~</span> on the command line
(but <em>not</em> in script files). Also, the standard Tandem syntax for
<span class="samp">/in filename,out filename/</span> must be used instead of the usual
Unix <span class="samp">&lt;</span> and <span class="samp">&gt;</span> for file redirection.  (Redirection options
on <code>getline</code>, <code>print</code> etc., are supported.)

   <p>The <span class="samp">-mr </span><var>val</var> option
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>)
has been &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; to enable Tandem users to process fixed-length
records with no &ldquo;end-of-line&rdquo; character. That is, <span class="samp">-mr 74</span> tells
<span class="command">gawk</span> to read the input file as fixed 74-byte records.

please report it to the developers; we cannot promise to do anything
but we might well want to fix it.

   <p>Before reporting a bug, make sure you have actually found a real bug. 
Carefully reread the documentation and see if it really says you can do
what you're trying to do.  If it's not clear whether you should be able
to do something or not, report that too; it's a bug in the documentation!

   <p>Before reporting a bug or trying to fix it yourself, try to isolate it
to the smallest possible <span class="command">awk</span> program and input data file that
reproduces the problem.  Then send us the program and data file,
some idea of what kind of Unix system you're using,
the compiler you used to compile <span class="command">gawk</span>, and the exact results
<span class="command">gawk</span> gave you.  Also say what you expected to occur; this helps
us decide whether the problem is really in the documentation.

See <a href="#POSIX_002fGNU">POSIX/GNU</a>,
for a summary of the GNU extensions to the <span class="command">awk</span> language and program. 
All of these features can be turned off by invoking <span class="command">gawk</span> with the

   <p>If <span class="command">gawk</span> is compiled for debugging with <span class="samp">-DDEBUG</span>, then there
is one more option available on the command line:

<dt><code>-W parsedebug</code><dt><code>--parsedebug</code><dd>Prints out the parse stack information as the program is being parsed. 
</dl>

   <p>This option is intended only for serious <span class="command">gawk</span> developers
and not for the casual user.  It probably has not even been compiled into
your version of <span class="command">gawk</span>, since it slows down execution.

<a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-features_002c-adding-1964"></a>You are free to add any new features you like to <span class="command">gawk</span>. 
However, if you want your changes to be incorporated into the <span class="command">gawk</span>
distribution, there are several steps that you need to take in order to
make it possible for me to include your changes:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Before building the new feature into <span class="command">gawk</span> itself,
consider writing it as an extension module
(see <a href="#Dynamic-Extensions">Dynamic Extensions</a>). 
If that's not possible, continue with the rest of the steps in this list.

     <li>Get the latest version. 
It is much easier for me to integrate changes if they are relative to
the most recent distributed version of <span class="command">gawk</span>.  If your version of
<span class="command">gawk</span> is very old, I may not be able to integrate them at all. 
(See <a href="#Getting">Getting</a>,
for information on getting the latest version of <span class="command">gawk</span>.)

     <li>Follow the <cite>GNU Coding Standards</cite>. 
This document describes how GNU software should be written. If you haven't
read it, please do so, preferably <em>before</em> starting to modify <span class="command">gawk</span>. 
(The <cite>GNU Coding Standards</cite> are available from
the GNU Project's
<span class="command">ftp</span>
site, at
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/GNUinfo/standards.text">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/GNUinfo/standards.text</a>. 
An HTML version, suitable for reading with a WWW browser, is
available at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html">http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html</a>. 
Texinfo, Info, and DVI versions are also available.)

     <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-coding-style-in-1965"></a><li>Use the <span class="command">gawk</span> coding style. 
The C code for <span class="command">gawk</span> follows the instructions in the
<cite>GNU Coding Standards</cite>, with minor exceptions.  The code is formatted
using the traditional &ldquo;K&amp;R&rdquo; style, particularly as regards to the placement
of braces and the use of tabs.  In brief, the coding rules for <span class="command">gawk</span>
are as follows:

          <ul>
<li>Use ANSI/ISO style (prototype) function headers when defining functions.

          <li>Put the name of the function at the beginning of its own line.

          <li>Put the return type of the function, even if it is <code>int</code>, on the
line above the line with the name and arguments of the function.

          <li>Put spaces around parentheses used in control structures
(<code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>do</code>, <code>switch</code>,
and <code>return</code>).

          <li>Do not put spaces in front of parentheses used in function calls.

          <li>Put spaces around all C operators and after commas in function calls.

          <li>Do not use the comma operator to produce multiple side effects, except
in <code>for</code> loop initialization and increment parts, and in macro bodies.

          <li>Use real tabs for indenting, not spaces.

          <li>Use the &ldquo;K&amp;R&rdquo; brace layout style.

          <li>Use comparisons against <code>NULL</code> and <code>'\0'</code> in the conditions of
<code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code> statements, as well as in the <code>case</code>s
of <code>switch</code> statements, instead of just the
plain pointer or character value.

          <li>Use the <code>TRUE</code>, <code>FALSE</code> and <code>NULL</code> symbolic constants
and the character constant <code>'\0'</code> where appropriate, instead of <code>1</code>
and <code>0</code>.

          <li>Use the <code>ISALPHA</code>, <code>ISDIGIT</code>, etc. macros, instead of the
traditional lowercase versions; these macros are better behaved for
non-ASCII character sets.

          <li>Provide one-line descriptive comments for each function.

          <li>Do not use <span class="samp">#elif</span>. Many older Unix C compilers cannot handle it.

          <li>Do not use the <code>alloca</code> function for allocating memory off the stack. 
Its use causes more portability trouble than is worth the minor benefit of not having
to free the storage. Instead, use <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>. 
</ul>

     <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> If I have to reformat your code to follow the coding style used in
<span class="command">gawk</span>, I may not bother to integrate your changes at all. 
</blockquote>

     <li>Be prepared to sign the appropriate paperwork. 
In order for the FSF to distribute your changes, you must either place
those changes in the public domain and submit a signed statement to that
effect, or assign the copyright in your changes to the FSF. 
Both of these actions are easy to do and <em>many</em> people have done so
already. If you have questions, please contact me
(see <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>),
or <a href="mailto:gnu@gnu.org">gnu@gnu.org</a>.

     <p><a name="index-Texinfo-1966"></a><li>Update the documentation. 
Along with your new code, please supply new sections and/or chapters
for this Web page.  If at all possible, please use real
Texinfo, instead of just supplying unformatted ASCII text (although
even that is better than no documentation at all). 
Conventions to be followed in <cite>GAWK: Effective AWK Programming</cite> are provided
after the <span class="samp">@bye</span> at the end of the Texinfo source file. 
If possible, please update the <span class="command">man</span> page as well.

     <p>You will also have to sign paperwork for your documentation changes.

     <li>Submit changes as context diffs or unified diffs. 
Use <span class="samp">diff -c -r -N</span> or <span class="samp">diff -u -r -N</span> to compare
the original <span class="command">gawk</span> source tree with your version. 
(I find context diffs to be more readable but unified diffs are
more compact.) 
I recommend using the GNU version of <span class="command">diff</span>. 
Send the output produced by either run of <span class="command">diff</span> to me when you
submit your changes. 
(See <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>, for the electronic mail
information.)

     <p>Using this format makes it easy for me to apply your changes to the
master version of the <span class="command">gawk</span> source code (using <code>patch</code>). 
If I have to apply the changes manually, using a text editor, I may
not do so, particularly if there are lots of changes.

     <li>Include an entry for the <span class="file">ChangeLog</span> file with your submission. 
This helps further minimize the amount of work I have to do,
making it easier for me to accept patches.
        </ol>

   <p>Although this sounds like a lot of work, please remember that while you
may write the new code, I have to maintain it and support it. If it
isn't possible for me to do that with a minimum of extra work, then I
probably will not.

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.2.2 Porting <span class="command">gawk</span> to a New Operating System</h4>

<p><a name="index-portability_002c-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-1967"></a><a name="index-operating-systems_002c-porting-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-to-1968"></a>
<a name="index-porting-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-1969"></a>If you want to port <span class="command">gawk</span> to a new operating system, there are
several steps:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Follow the guidelines in
the previous section
concerning coding style, submission of diffs, and so on.

     <li>When doing a port, bear in mind that your code must coexist peacefully
with the rest of <span class="command">gawk</span> and the other ports. Avoid gratuitous
changes to the system-independent parts of the code. If at all possible,
avoid sprinkling <span class="samp">#ifdef</span>s just for your port throughout the
code.

     <p>If the changes needed for a particular system affect too much of the
code, I probably will not accept them.  In such a case, you can, of course,
distribute your changes on your own, as long as you comply
with the GPL
(see <a href="#Copying">Copying</a>).

     <li>A number of the files that come with <span class="command">gawk</span> are maintained by other
people at the Free Software Foundation.  Thus, you should not change them
unless it is for a very good reason; i.e., changes are not out of the
question, but changes to these files are scrutinized extra carefully. 
The files are <span class="file">getopt.h</span>, <span class="file">getopt.c</span>, <span class="file">getopt1.c</span>,
<span class="file">regex.h</span>, <span class="file">regex.c</span>, <span class="file">regcomp.c</span>, <span class="file">regex_internal.c</span>,
<span class="file">regex_internal.h</span>, <span class="file">regexec.c</span>, <span class="file">dfa.h</span>, <span class="file">dfa.c</span>,
<span class="file">install-sh</span>, and <span class="file">mkinstalldirs</span>.

     <li>Be willing to continue to maintain the port. 
Non-Unix operating systems are supported by volunteers who maintain
the code needed to compile and run <span class="command">gawk</span> on their systems. If noone
volunteers to maintain a port, it becomes unsupported and it may
be necessary to remove it from the distribution.

     <li>Supply an appropriate <span class="file">gawkmisc.???</span> file. 
Each port has its own <span class="file">gawkmisc.???</span> that implements certain
operating system specific functions. This is cleaner than a plethora of
<span class="samp">#ifdef</span>s scattered throughout the code.  The <span class="file">gawkmisc.c</span> in
the main source directory includes the appropriate
<span class="file">gawkmisc.???</span> file from each subdirectory. 
Be sure to update it as well.

     <p>Each port's <span class="file">gawkmisc.???</span> file has a suffix reminiscent of the machine
or operating system for the port&mdash;for example, <span class="file">pc/gawkmisc.pc</span> and
<span class="file">vms/gawkmisc.vms</span>. The use of separate suffixes, instead of plain
<span class="file">gawkmisc.c</span>, makes it possible to move files from a port's subdirectory
into the main subdirectory, without accidentally destroying the real
<span class="file">gawkmisc.c</span> file.  (Currently, this is only an issue for the
PC operating system ports.)

     <li>Supply a <span class="file">Makefile</span> as well as any other C source and header files that are
necessary for your operating system.  All your code should be in a
separate subdirectory, with a name that is the same as, or reminiscent
of, either your operating system or the computer system.  If possible,
try to structure things so that it is not necessary to move files out
of the subdirectory into the main source directory.  If that is not
possible, then be sure to avoid using names for your files that
duplicate the names of files in the main source directory.

     <li>Update the documentation. 
Please write a section (or sections) for this Web page describing the
installation and compilation steps needed to compile and/or install
<span class="command">gawk</span> for your system.

     <li>Be prepared to sign the appropriate paperwork. 
In order for the FSF to distribute your code, you must either place
your code in the public domain and submit a signed statement to that
effect, or assign the copyright in your code to the FSF.
        </ol>

   <p>Following these steps makes it much easier to integrate your changes
into <span class="command">gawk</span> and have them coexist happily with other
operating systems' code that is already there.

   <p>In the code that you supply and maintain, feel free to use a
coding style and brace layout that suits your taste.

<a name="index-functions_002c-built_002din_002c-adding-to-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-1975"></a>Beginning with <span class="command">gawk</span> 3.1, it is possible to add new built-in
functions to <span class="command">gawk</span> using dynamically loaded libraries. This
facility is available on systems (such as GNU/Linux) that support
the <code>dlopen</code> and <code>dlsym</code> functions. 
This section describes how to write and use dynamically
loaded extensions for <span class="command">gawk</span>. 
Experience with programming in
C or C++ is necessary when reading this section.

   <p><strong>Caution:</strong> The facilities described in this section
are very much subject to change in a future <span class="command">gawk</span> release. 
Be aware that you may have to re-do everything, perhaps from scratch,
at some future time.

   <p><strong>Caution:</strong> If you have written your own dynamic extensions,
be sure to recompile them for each new <span class="command">gawk</span> release. 
There is no guarantee of binary compatibility between different
releases, nor will there ever be such a guarantee.

<p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-internals-1976"></a>
The truth is that <span class="command">gawk</span> was not designed for simple extensibility. 
The facilities for adding functions using shared libraries work, but
are something of a &ldquo;bag on the side.&rdquo;  Thus, this tour is
brief and simplistic; would-be <span class="command">gawk</span> hackers are encouraged to
spend some time reading the source code before trying to write
extensions based on the material presented here.  Of particular note
are the files <span class="file">awk.h</span>, <span class="file">builtin.c</span>, and <span class="file">eval.c</span>. 
Reading <span class="file">awkgram.y</span> in order to see how the parse tree is built
would also be of use.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bawk_002eh_007d-file-_0028internal_0029-1977"></a>With the disclaimers out of the way, the following types, structure
members, functions, and macros are declared in <span class="file">awk.h</span> and are of
use when writing extensions.  The next section
shows how they are used:

<dl><dt><code>AWKNUM</code><dd>An <code>AWKNUM</code> is the internal type of <span class="command">awk</span>
floating-point numbers.  Typically, it is a C <code>double</code>.

this can be used to determine the maximum index which is
safe to use with <code>stack_ptr</code>.  If this value is
greater than <code>tree-&gt;param_cnt</code>, the function was
called incorrectly from the <span class="command">awk</span> program.

the value in <code>n-&gt;stptr[n-&gt;stlen]</code>, assign <code>'\0'</code> to it,
call the routine, and then restore the value.

function registered is called first) each open hook until one returns
non-NULL.  If any hook returns a non-NULL value, that value is assigned
to the <code>IOBUF</code>'s <code>opaque</code> field (which will presumably point

up any state associated with the input.

     <p>Finally, hook functions should be prepared to receive an <code>IOBUF</code>

meaning that <span class="command">gawk</span> was not able to open the file itself. In
this case, the hook function must be able to successfully open the file

</dl>

   <p>An argument that is supposed to be an array needs to be handled with
some extra code, in case the array being passed in is actually
from a function parameter.

   <p>In versions of <span class="command">gawk</span> up to and including 3.1.2, the
following boilerplate code shows how to do this:

<pre class="smallexample">     NODE *the_arg;
     
     the_arg = get_argument(tree, 2); /* assume need 3rd arg, 0-based */
     
     /* if a parameter, get it off the stack */
     if (the_arg-&gt;type == Node_param_list)
         the_arg = stack_ptr[the_arg-&gt;param_cnt];
     
     /* parameter referenced an array, get it */
     if (the_arg-&gt;type == Node_array_ref)
         the_arg = the_arg-&gt;orig_array;
     
     /* check type */
     if (the_arg-&gt;type != Node_var &amp;&amp; the_arg-&gt;type != Node_var_array)
         fatal("newfunc: third argument is not an array");
     
     /* force it to be an array, if necessary, clear it */
     the_arg-&gt;type = Node_var_array;
     assoc_clear(the_arg);
</pre>
   <p>For versions 3.1.3 and later, the internals changed.  In particular,
the interface was actually <em>simplified</em> drastically.  The
following boilerplate code now suffices:

<pre class="smallexample">     NODE *the_arg;
     
     the_arg = get_argument(tree, 2); /* assume need 3rd arg, 0-based */
     
     /* force it to be an array: */
     the_arg = get_array(the_arg);
     
     /* if necessary, clear it: */
     assoc_clear(the_arg);
</pre>
   <p>As of version 3.1.4, the internals improved again, and became
even simpler:

<pre class="smallexample">     NODE *the_arg;
     
     the_arg = get_array_argument(tree, 2, FALSE); /* assume need 3rd arg, 0-based */
</pre>
   <p>Again, you should spend time studying the <span class="command">gawk</span> internals;
don't just blindly copy this code.

Two useful functions that are not in <span class="command">awk</span> are <code>chdir</code>

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">C.3.2.1 Using <code>chdir</code> and <code>stat</code></h5>

<p>This section shows how to use the new functions at the <span class="command">awk</span>
level once they've been integrated into the running <span class="command">gawk</span>
interpreter. 
Using <code>chdir</code> is very straightforward. It takes one argument,
the new directory to change to:

<pre class="example">     ...
     newdir = "/home/arnold/funstuff"
     ret = chdir(newdir)
     if (ret &lt; 0) {
         printf("could not change to %s: %s\n",
                        newdir, ERRNO) &gt; "/dev/stderr"
         exit 1
     }
     ...
</pre>
   <p>The return value is negative if the <code>chdir</code> failed,
and <code>ERRNO</code>
(see <a href="#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>)
is set to a string indicating the error.

   <p>Using <code>stat</code> is a bit more complicated. 
The C <code>stat</code> function fills in a structure that has a fair
amount of information. 
The right way to model this in <span class="command">awk</span> is to fill in an associative
array with the appropriate information:

<!-- broke printf for page breaking -->
<pre class="example">     file = "/home/arnold/.profile"
     fdata[1] = "x"    # force `fdata' to be an array
     ret = stat(file, fdata)
     if (ret &lt; 0) {
         printf("could not stat %s: %s\n",
                  file, ERRNO) &gt; "/dev/stderr"
         exit 1
     }
     printf("size of %s is %d bytes\n", file, fdata["size"])
</pre>
   <p>The <code>stat</code> function always clears the data array, even if
the <code>stat</code> fails.  It fills in the following elements:

     <dl>
<dt><code>"name"</code><dd>The name of the file that was <code>stat</code>'ed.

     <br><dt><code>"dev"</code><dt><code>"ino"</code><dd>The file's device and inode numbers, respectively.

     <br><dt><code>"mode"</code><dd>The file's mode, as a numeric value. This includes both the file's
type and its permissions.

     <br><dt><code>"nlink"</code><dd>The number of hard links (directory entries) the file has.

     <br><dt><code>"uid"</code><dt><code>"gid"</code><dd>The numeric user and group ID numbers of the file's owner.

     <br><dt><code>"size"</code><dd>The size in bytes of the file.

     <br><dt><code>"blocks"</code><dd>The number of disk blocks the file actually occupies. This may not
be a function of the file's size if the file has holes.

     <br><dt><code>"atime"</code><dt><code>"mtime"</code><dt><code>"ctime"</code><dd>The file's last access, modification, and inode update times,
respectively.  These are numeric timestamps, suitable for formatting
with <code>strftime</code>
(see <a href="#Built_002din">Built-in</a>).

     <br><dt><code>"pmode"</code><dd>The file's &ldquo;printable mode.&rdquo;  This is a string representation of
the file's type and permissions, such as what is produced by
<span class="samp">ls -l</span>&mdash;for example, <code>"drwxr-xr-x"</code>.

     <br><dt><code>"type"</code><dd>A printable string representation of the file's type.  The value
is one of the following:

          <dl>
<dt><code>"blockdev"</code><dt><code>"chardev"</code><dd>The file is a block or character device (&ldquo;special file&rdquo;).

          <br><dt><code>"directory"</code><dd>The file is a directory.

          <br><dt><code>"fifo"</code><dd>The file is a named-pipe (also known as a FIFO).

          <br><dt><code>"file"</code><dd>The file is just a regular file.

          <br><dt><code>"socket"</code><dd>The file is an <code>AF_UNIX</code> (&ldquo;Unix domain&rdquo;) socket in the
filesystem.

          <br><dt><code>"symlink"</code><dd>The file is a symbolic link. 
</dl>
     </dl>

   <p>Several additional elements may be present depending upon the operating
system and the type of the file.  You can test for them in your <span class="command">awk</span>
program by using the <code>in</code> operator
(see <a href="#Reference-to-Elements">Reference to Elements</a>):

     <dl>
<dt><code>"blksize"</code><dd>The preferred block size for I/O to the file. This field is not
present on all POSIX-like systems in the C <code>stat</code> structure.

     <br><dt><code>"linkval"</code><dd>If the file is a symbolic link, this element is the name of the
file the link points to (i.e., the value of the link).

     <br><dt><code>"rdev"</code><dt><code>"major"</code><dt><code>"minor"</code><dd>If the file is a block or character device file, then these values
represent the numeric device number and the major and minor components
of that number, respectively. 
</dl>

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">C.3.2.2 C Code for <code>chdir</code> and <code>stat</code></h5>

<p>Here is the C code for these extensions.  They were written for
GNU/Linux.  The code needs some more work for complete portability
to other POSIX-compliant systems:<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-74" name="fnd-74"><sup>74</sup></a>

<!-- break line for page breaking -->
<pre class="example">     #include "awk.h"
     
     #include &lt;sys/sysmacros.h&gt;
     
     /*  do_chdir --- provide dynamically loaded
                      chdir() builtin for gawk */
     
     static NODE *
     do_chdir(tree)
     NODE *tree;
     {
         NODE *newdir;
         int ret = -1;
     
         if (do_lint &amp;&amp; get_curfunc_arg_count() != 1)
             lintwarn("chdir: called with incorrect number of arguments");
     
         newdir = get_scalar_argument(tree, 0);
</pre>
   <p>The file includes the <code>"awk.h"</code> header file for definitions
for the <span class="command">gawk</span> internals.  It includes <code>&lt;sys/sysmacros.h&gt;</code>
for access to the <code>major</code> and <code>minor</code> macros.

   <p><a name="index-programming-conventions_002c-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-internals-2033"></a>By convention, for an <span class="command">awk</span> function <code>foo</code>, the function that
implements it is called <span class="samp">do_foo</span>.  The function should take
a <span class="samp">NODE *</span> argument, usually called <code>tree</code>, that
represents the argument list to the function.  The <code>newdir</code>
variable represents the new directory to change to, retrieved
with <code>get_argument</code>.  Note that the first argument is
numbered zero.

   <p>This code actually accomplishes the <code>chdir</code>. It first forces
the argument to be a string and passes the string value to the
<code>chdir</code> system call. If the <code>chdir</code> fails, <code>ERRNO</code>
is updated. 
The result of <code>force_string</code> has to be freed with <code>free_temp</code>:

<pre class="example">         (void) force_string(newdir);
         ret = chdir(newdir-&gt;stptr);
         if (ret &lt; 0)
             update_ERRNO();
         free_temp(newdir);
</pre>
   <p>Finally, the function returns the return value to the <span class="command">awk</span> level,
using <code>set_value</code>. Then it must return a value from the call to
the new built-in (this value ignored by the interpreter):

<pre class="example">         /* Set the return value */
         set_value(tmp_number((AWKNUM) ret));
     
         /* Just to make the interpreter happy */
         return tmp_number((AWKNUM) 0);
     }
</pre>
   <p>The <code>stat</code> built-in is more involved.  First comes a function
that turns a numeric mode into a printable representation
(e.g., 644 becomes <span class="samp">-rw-r--r--</span>). This is omitted here for brevity:

<!-- break line for page breaking -->
<pre class="example">     /* format_mode --- turn a stat mode field
                        into something readable */
     
     static char *
     format_mode(fmode)
     unsigned long fmode;
     {
         ...
     }
</pre>
   <p>Next comes the actual <code>do_stat</code> function itself.  First come the
variable declarations and argument checking:

<pre class="example">     /* do_stat --- provide a stat() function for gawk */
     
     static NODE *
     do_stat(tree)
     NODE *tree;
     {
         NODE *file, *array;
         struct stat sbuf;
         int ret;
         NODE **aptr;
         char *pmode;    /* printable mode */
         char *type = "unknown";
     
     
         if (do_lint &amp;&amp; get_curfunc_arg_count() &gt; 2)
             lintwarn("stat: called with too many arguments");
</pre>
   <p>Then comes the actual work. First, we get the arguments. 
Then, we always clear the array.  To get the file information,
we use <code>lstat</code>, in case the file is a symbolic link. 
If there's an error, we set <code>ERRNO</code> and return:

<!-- comment made multiline for page breaking -->
<pre class="example">         /* directory is first arg, array to hold results is second */
         file = get_scalar_argument(tree, 0, FALSE);
         array = get_array_argument(tree, 1, FALSE);
     
         /* empty out the array */
         assoc_clear(array);
     
         /* lstat the file, if error, set ERRNO and return */
         (void) force_string(file);
         ret = lstat(file-&gt;stptr, &amp; sbuf);
         if (ret &lt; 0) {
             update_ERRNO();
     
             set_value(tmp_number((AWKNUM) ret));
     
             free_temp(file);
             return tmp_number((AWKNUM) 0);
         }
</pre>
   <p>Now comes the tedious part: filling in the array.  Only a few of the
calls are shown here, since they all follow the same pattern:

<pre class="example">         /* fill in the array */
         aptr = assoc_lookup(array, tmp_string("name", 4), FALSE);
         *aptr = dupnode(file);
     
         aptr = assoc_lookup(array, tmp_string("mode", 4), FALSE);
         *aptr = make_number((AWKNUM) sbuf.st_mode);
     
         aptr = assoc_lookup(array, tmp_string("pmode", 5), FALSE);
         pmode = format_mode(sbuf.st_mode);
         *aptr = make_string(pmode, strlen(pmode));
</pre>
   <p>When done, we free the temporary value containing the file name,
set the return value, and return:

<pre class="example">         free_temp(file);
     
         /* Set the return value */
         set_value(tmp_number((AWKNUM) ret));
     
         /* Just to make the interpreter happy */
         return tmp_number((AWKNUM) 0);
     }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-programming-conventions_002c-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-internals-2034"></a>Finally, it's necessary to provide the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; that loads the
new function(s) into <span class="command">gawk</span>.  By convention, each library has
a routine named <code>dlload</code> that does the job:

<pre class="example">     /* dlload --- load new builtins in this library */
     
     NODE *
     dlload(tree, dl)
     NODE *tree;
     void *dl;
     {
         make_builtin("chdir", do_chdir, 1);
         make_builtin("stat", do_stat, 2);
         return tmp_number((AWKNUM) 0);
     }
</pre>
   <p>And that's it!  As an exercise, consider adding functions to
implement system calls such as <code>chown</code>, <code>chmod</code>, and <code>umask</code>.

It returns the value returned by the initialization function

<i>AWK is a language similar to PERL, only considerably more elegant.</i><br>
Arnold Robbins

        <p><i>Hey!</i><br>
Larry Wall
</blockquote>

   <p>This section briefly lists extensions and possible improvements
that indicate the directions we are
currently considering for <span class="command">gawk</span>.  The file <span class="file">FUTURES</span> in the
<span class="command">gawk</span> distribution lists these extensions as well.

   <p>Following is a list of probable future changes visible at the
<span class="command">awk</span> language level:

<!-- these are ordered by likelihood -->
<dl>
<dt>Loadable module interface<dd>It is not clear that the <span class="command">awk</span>-level interface to the
modules facility is as good as it should be.  The interface needs to be
redesigned, particularly taking namespace issues into account, as
well as possibly including issues such as library search path order
and versioning.

     <br><dt><code>RECLEN</code> variable for fixed-length records<dd>Along with <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code>, this would speed up the processing of
fixed-length records. 
<code>PROCINFO["RS"]</code> would be <code>"RS"</code> or <code>"RECLEN"</code>,
depending upon which kind of record processing is in effect.

     <br><dt>Additional <code>printf</code> specifiers<dd>The 1999 ISO C standard added a number of additional <code>printf</code>
format specifiers.  These should be evaluated for possible inclusion
in <span class="command">gawk</span>.

     <br><dt>Databases<dd>It may be possible to map a GDBM/NDBM/SDBM file into an <span class="command">awk</span> array.

     <br><dt>More <code>lint</code> warnings<dd>There are more things that could be checked for portability. 
</dl>

   <p>Following is a list of probable improvements that will make <span class="command">gawk</span>'s
source code easier to work with:

     <dl>
<dt>Loadable module mechanics<dd>The current extension mechanism works
(see <a href="#Dynamic-Extensions">Dynamic Extensions</a>),
but is rather primitive. It requires a fair amount of manual work
to create and integrate a loadable module. 
Nor is the current mechanism as portable as might be desired. 
The GNU <span class="command">libtool</span> package provides a number of features that
would make using loadable modules much easier. 
<span class="command">gawk</span> should be changed to use <span class="command">libtool</span>.

     <br><dt>Loadable module internals<dd>The API to its internals that <span class="command">gawk</span> &ldquo;exports&rdquo; should be revised. 
Too many things are needlessly exposed.  A new API should be designed
and implemented to make module writing easier.

     <br><dt>Better array subscript management<dd><span class="command">gawk</span>'s management of array subscript storage could use revamping,
so that using the same value to index multiple arrays only
stores one copy of the index value.

     <br><dt>Integrating the DBUG library<dd>Integrating Fred Fish's DBUG library would be helpful during development,
but it's a lot of work to do. 
</dl>

   <p>Following is a list of probable improvements that will make <span class="command">gawk</span>
perform better:

     <dl>
<!-- NEXT ED: remove this item. awka and mawk do these respectively -->
<dt>Compilation of <span class="command">awk</span> programs<dd><span class="command">gawk</span> uses a Bison (YACC-like)
parser to convert the script given it into a syntax tree; the syntax
tree is then executed by a simple recursive evaluator.  This method incurs
a lot of overhead, since the recursive evaluator performs many procedure
calls to do even the simplest things.

     <p>It should be possible for <span class="command">gawk</span> to convert the script's parse tree
into a C program which the user would then compile, using the normal
C compiler and a special <span class="command">gawk</span> library to provide all the needed
functions (regexps, fields, associative arrays, type coercion, and so on).

     <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-interpreter_0040comma_007b_007d-adding-code-to-2040"></a>An easier possibility might be for an intermediate phase of <span class="command">gawk</span> to
convert the parse tree into a linear byte code form like the one used
in GNU Emacs Lisp.  The recursive evaluator would then be replaced by
a straight line byte code interpreter that would be intermediate in speed
between running a compiled program and doing what <span class="command">gawk</span> does
now. 
</dl>

   <p>Finally,
the programs in the test suite could use documenting in this Web page.

This appendix attempts to define some of the basic concepts
and terms that are used throughout the rest of this Web page. 
As this Web page is specifically about <span class="command">awk</span>,
and not about computer programming in general, the coverage here
is by necessity fairly cursory and simplistic. 
(If you need more background, there are many
other introductory texts that you should refer to instead.)

<h3 class="appendixsec">D.1 What a Program Does</h3>

<p><a name="index-processing-data-2043"></a>At the most basic level, the job of a program is to process
some input data and produce results.

<!-- NEXT ED: Use real images here -->
<pre class="example">                       _______
     +------+         /       \         +---------+
     | Data | -----&gt; &lt; Program &gt; -----&gt; | Results |
     +------+         \_______/         +---------+
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-compiled-programs-2044"></a><a name="index-interpreted-programs-2045"></a>The &ldquo;program&rdquo; in the figure can be either a compiled
program<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-75" name="fnd-75"><sup>75</sup></a>
(such as <span class="command">ls</span>),
or it may be <dfn>interpreted</dfn>.  In the latter case, a machine-executable
program such as <span class="command">awk</span> reads your program, and then uses the
instructions in your program to process the data.

   <p><a name="index-programming_002c-basic-steps-2046"></a>When you write a program, it usually consists
of the following, very basic set of steps:

<!-- NEXT ED: Use real images here -->
<pre class="example">                                   ______
     +----------------+           / More \  No       +----------+
     | Initialization | -------&gt; &lt;  Data  &gt; -------&gt; | Clean Up |
     +----------------+    ^      \   ?  /           +----------+
                           |       +--+-+
                           |          | Yes
                           |          |
                           |          V
                           |     +---------+
                           +-----+ Process |
                                 +---------+
</pre>
     <dl>
<dt>Initialization<dd>These are the things you do before actually starting to process
data, such as checking arguments, initializing any data you need
to work with, and so on. 
This step corresponds to <span class="command">awk</span>'s <code>BEGIN</code> rule
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>).

     <p>If you were baking a cake, this might consist of laying out all the
mixing bowls and the baking pan, and making sure you have all the
ingredients that you need.

     <br><dt>Processing<dd>This is where the actual work is done.  Your program reads data,
one logical chunk at a time, and processes it as appropriate.

     <p>In most programming languages, you have to manually manage the reading
of data, checking to see if there is more each time you read a chunk. 
<span class="command">awk</span>'s pattern-action paradigm
(see <a href="#Getting-Started">Getting Started</a>)
handles the mechanics of this for you.

     <p>In baking a cake, the processing corresponds to the actual labor:
breaking eggs, mixing the flour, water, and other ingredients, and then putting the cake
into the oven.

     <br><dt>Clean Up<dd>Once you've processed all the data, you may have things you need to
do before exiting. 
This step corresponds to <span class="command">awk</span>'s <code>END</code> rule
(see <a href="#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>).

     <p>After the cake comes out of the oven, you still have to wrap it in
plastic wrap to keep anyone from tasting it, as well as wash
the mixing bowls and utensils. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-algorithms-2047"></a>An <dfn>algorithm</dfn> is a detailed set of instructions necessary to accomplish
a task, or process data.  It is much the same as a recipe for baking
a cake.  Programs implement algorithms.  Often, it is up to you to design
the algorithm and implement it, simultaneously.

   <p><a name="index-records-2048"></a><a name="index-fields-2049"></a>The &ldquo;logical chunks&rdquo; we talked about previously are called <dfn>records</dfn>,
similar to the records a company keeps on employees, a school keeps for
students, or a doctor keeps for patients. 
Each record has many component parts, such as first and last names,
date of birth, address, and so on.  The component parts are referred
to as the <dfn>fields</dfn> of the record.

   <p>The act of reading data is termed <dfn>input</dfn>, and that of
generating results, not too surprisingly, is termed <dfn>output</dfn>. 
They are often referred to together as &ldquo;input/output,&rdquo;
and even more often, as &ldquo;I/O&rdquo; for short. 
(You will also see &ldquo;input&rdquo; and &ldquo;output&rdquo; used as verbs.)

   <p><a name="index-data_002ddriven-languages-2050"></a><a name="index-languages_0040comma_007b_007d-data_002ddriven-2051"></a><span class="command">awk</span> manages the reading of data for you, as well as the
breaking it up into records and fields.  Your program's job is to
tell <span class="command">awk</span> what to with the data.  You do this by describing
<dfn>patterns</dfn> in the data to look for, and <dfn>actions</dfn> to execute
when those patterns are seen.  This <dfn>data-driven</dfn> nature of
<span class="command">awk</span> programs usually makes them both easier to write
and easier to read.

<h3 class="appendixsec">D.2 Data Values in a Computer</h3>

<p><a name="index-variables-2052"></a>In a program,
you keep track of information and values in things called <dfn>variables</dfn>. 
A variable is just a name for a given value, such as <code>first_name</code>,
<code>last_name</code>, <code>address</code>, and so on. 
<span class="command">awk</span> has several predefined variables, and it has
special names to refer to the current input record
and the fields of the record. 
You may also group multiple
associated values under one name, as an array.

   <p><a name="index-values_002c-numeric-2053"></a><a name="index-values_002c-string-2054"></a><a name="index-scalar-values-2055"></a>Data, particularly in <span class="command">awk</span>, consists of either numeric
values, such as 42 or 3.1415927, or string values. 
String values are essentially anything that's not a number, such as a name. 
Strings are sometimes referred to as <dfn>character data</dfn>, since they
store the individual characters that comprise them. 
Individual variables, as well as numeric and string variables, are
referred to as <dfn>scalar</dfn> values. 
Groups of values, such as arrays, are not scalars.

   <p><a name="index-integers-2056"></a><a name="index-floating_002dpoint_002c-numbers-2057"></a><a name="index-numbers_002c-floating_002dpoint-2058"></a>Within computers, there are two kinds of numeric values: <dfn>integers</dfn>
and <dfn>floating-point</dfn>. 
In school, integer values were referred to as &ldquo;whole&rdquo; numbers&mdash;that is,
numbers without any fractional part, such as 1, 42, or &minus;17. 
The advantage to integer numbers is that they represent values exactly. 
The disadvantage is that their range is limited.  On most modern systems,
this range is &minus;2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

   <p><a name="index-unsigned-integers-2059"></a><a name="index-integers_002c-unsigned-2060"></a>Integer values come in two flavors: <dfn>signed</dfn> and <dfn>unsigned</dfn>. 
Signed values may be negative or positive, with the range of values just
described. 
Unsigned values are always positive.  On most modern systems,
the range is from 0 to 4,294,967,295.

   <p><a name="index-double_002dprecision-floating_002dpoint-2061"></a><a name="index-single_002dprecision-floating_002dpoint-2062"></a>Floating-point numbers represent what are called &ldquo;real&rdquo; numbers; i.e.,
those that do have a fractional part, such as 3.1415927. 
The advantage to floating-point numbers is that they
can represent a much larger range of values. 
The disadvantage is that there are numbers that they cannot represent
exactly. 
<span class="command">awk</span> uses <dfn>double-precision</dfn> floating-point numbers, which
can hold more digits than <dfn>single-precision</dfn>
floating-point numbers. 
Floating-point issues are discussed more fully in
<a href="#Floating-Point-Issues">Floating Point Issues</a>.

   <p>At the very lowest level, computers store values as groups of binary digits,
or <dfn>bits</dfn>.  Modern computers group bits into groups of eight, called <dfn>bytes</dfn>. 
Advanced applications sometimes have to manipulate bits directly,
and <span class="command">gawk</span> provides functions for doing so.

   <p><a name="index-null-strings-2063"></a>While you are probably used to the idea of a number without a value (i.e., zero),
it takes a bit more getting used to the idea of zero-length character data. 
Nevertheless, such a thing exists. 
It is called the <dfn>null string</dfn>. 
The null string is character data that has no value. 
In other words, it is empty.  It is written in <span class="command">awk</span> programs
like this: <code>""</code>.

   <p>Humans are used to working in decimal; i.e., base 10.  In base 10,
numbers go from 0 to 9, and then &ldquo;roll over&rdquo; into the next
column.  (Remember grade school? 42 is 4 times 10 plus 2.)

   <p>There are other number bases though.  Computers commonly use base 2
or <dfn>binary</dfn>, base 8 or <dfn>octal</dfn>, and base 16 or <dfn>hexadecimal</dfn>. 
In binary, each column represents two times the value in the column to
its right. Each column may contain either a 0 or a 1. 
Thus, binary 1010 represents 1 times 8, plus 0 times 4, plus 1 times 2,
plus 0 times 1, or decimal 10. 
Octal and hexadecimal are discussed more in
<a href="#Nondecimal_002dnumbers">Nondecimal-numbers</a>.

   <p>Programs are written in programming languages. 
Hundreds, if not thousands, of programming languages exist. 
One of the most popular is the C programming language. 
The C language had a very strong influence on the design of
the <span class="command">awk</span> language.

   <p><a name="index-Kernighan_002c-Brian-2064"></a><a name="index-Ritchie_002c-Dennis-2065"></a>There have been several versions of C.  The first is often referred to
as &ldquo;K&amp;R&rdquo; C, after the initials of Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie,
the authors of the first book on C.  (Dennis Ritchie created the language,
and Brian Kernighan was one of the creators of <span class="command">awk</span>.)

   <p>In the mid-1980s, an effort began to produce an international standard
for C.  This work culminated in 1989, with the production of the ANSI
standard for C.  This standard became an ISO standard in 1990. 
Where it makes sense, POSIX <span class="command">awk</span> is compatible with 1990 ISO C.

   <p>In 1999, a revised ISO C standard was approved and released. 
Future versions of <span class="command">gawk</span> will be as compatible as possible
with this standard.

<h3 class="appendixsec">D.3 Floating-Point Number Caveats</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, floating-point numbers represent what are called
&ldquo;real&rdquo; numbers, i.e., those that have a fractional part.  <span class="command">awk</span>
uses double-precision floating-point numbers to represent all
numeric values.  This section describes some of the issues
involved in using floating-point numbers.

   <p>There is a very nice paper on floating-point arithmetic by
David Goldberg, &ldquo;What Every
Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-point Arithmetic,&rdquo;

5-48.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-76" name="fnd-76"><sup>76</sup></a>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">D.3.1 The String Value Can Lie</h4>

<p>Internally, <span class="command">awk</span> keeps both the numeric value
(double-precision floating-point) and the string value for a variable. 
Separately, <span class="command">awk</span> keeps
track of what type the variable has
(see <a href="#Typing-and-Comparison">Typing and Comparison</a>),
which plays a role in how variables are used in comparisons.

   <p>It is important to note that the string value for a number may not
reflect the full value (all the digits) that the numeric value
actually contains. 
The following program (<span class="file">values.awk</span>) illustrates this:

<pre class="example">     {
        $1 = $2 + $3
        # see it for what it is
        printf("$1 = %.12g\n", $1)
        # use CONVFMT
        a = "&lt;" $1 "&gt;"
        print "a =", a
        # use OFMT
        print "$1 =", $1
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This program shows the full value of the sum of <code>$2</code> and <code>$3</code>
using <code>printf</code>, and then prints the string values obtained
from both automatic conversion (via <code>CONVFMT</code>) and
from printing (via <code>OFMT</code>).

   <p>Here is what happens when the program is run:

<pre class="example">     $ echo 2 3.654321 1.2345678 | awk -f values.awk
     -| $1 = 4.8888888
     -| a = &lt;4.88889&gt;
     -| $1 = 4.88889
</pre>
   <p>This makes it clear that the full numeric value is different from
what the default string representations show.

   <p><code>CONVFMT</code>'s default value is <code>"%.6g"</code>, which yields a value with
at least six significant digits.  For some applications, you might want to
change it to specify more precision. 
On most modern machines, most of the time,
17 digits is enough to capture a floating-point number's
value exactly.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-77" name="fnd-77"><sup>77</sup></a>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">D.3.2 Floating Point Numbers Are Not Abstract Numbers</h4>

<p><a name="index-floating_002dpoint-2066"></a>Unlike numbers in the abstract sense (such as what you studied in high school
or college math), numbers stored in computers are limited in certain ways. 
They cannot represent an infinite number of digits, nor can they always
represent things exactly. 
In particular,
floating-point numbers cannot
always represent values exactly.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '{ printf("%010d\n", $1 * 100) }'
     515.79
     -| 0000051579
     515.80
     -| 0000051579
     515.81
     -| 0000051580
     515.82
     -| 0000051582
     <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This shows that some values can be represented exactly,
whereas others are only approximated.  This is not a &ldquo;bug&rdquo;
in <span class="command">awk</span>, but simply an artifact of how computers
represent numbers.

   <p><a name="index-negative-zero-2067"></a><a name="index-positive-zero-2068"></a><a name="index-zero_0040comma_007b_007d-negative-vs_002e_0040_003a-positive-2069"></a>Another peculiarity of floating-point numbers on modern systems
is that they often have more than one representation for the number zero! 
In particular, it is possible to represent &ldquo;minus zero&rdquo; as well as
regular, or &ldquo;positive&rdquo; zero.

   <p>This example shows that negative and positive zero are distinct values
when stored internally, but that they are in fact equal to each other,
as well as to &ldquo;regular&rdquo; zero:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gawk 'BEGIN { mz = -0 ; pz = 0
     &gt; printf "-0 = %g, +0 = %g, (-0 == +0) -&gt; %d\n", mz, pz, mz == pz
     &gt; printf "mz == 0 -&gt; %d, pz == 0 -&gt; %d\n", mz == 0, pz == 0
     &gt; }'
     -| -0 = -0, +0 = 0, (-0 == +0) -&gt; 1
     -| mz == 0 -&gt; 1, pz == 0 -&gt; 1
</pre>
   <p>It helps to keep this in mind should you process numeric data
that contains negative zero values; the fact that the zero is negative
is noted and can affect comparisons.

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">D.3.3 Standards Versus Existing Practice</h4>

<p>Historically, <span class="command">awk</span> has converted any non-numeric looking string
to the numeric value zero, when required.  Furthermore, the original
definition of the language and the original POSIX standards specified that
<span class="command">awk</span> only understands decimal numbers (base 10), and not octal
(base 8) or hexadecimal numbers (base 16).

   <p>As of this writing (February, 2007), changes in the language of the
current POSIX standard can be interpreted to imply that <span class="command">awk</span>
should support additional features.  These features are:

     <ul>
<li>Interpretation of floating point data values specified in hexadecimal
notation (<span class="samp">0xDEADBEEF</span>). (Note: data values, <em>not</em>
source code constants.)

     <li>Support for the special IEEE 754 floating point values &ldquo;Not A Number&rdquo;
(NaN), positive Infinity (&ldquo;inf&rdquo;) and negative Infinity (&ldquo;&minus;inf&rdquo;). 
In particular, the format for these values is as specified by the ISO C99
standard, which ignores case and can allow machine-dependent additional
characters after the <span class="samp">nan</span> and allow either <span class="samp">inf</span> or <span class="samp">infinity</span>. 
</ul>

   <p>The first problem is that both of these are clear changes to historical
practice:

     <ul>
<li>The <span class="command">gawk</span> maintainer feels that hexadecimal floating
point values, in particular, is ugly, and was never intended by the
original designers to be part of the language.

     <li>Allowing completely alphabetic strings to have valid numeric
values is also a very severe departure from historical practice. 
</ul>

   <p>The second problem is that the <code>gawk</code> maintainer feels that this
interpretation of the standard, which requires a certain amount of
&ldquo;language lawyering&rdquo; to arrive at in the first place, was not intended
by the standard developers, either.  In other words, &ldquo;we see how you
got where you are, but we don't think that that's where you want to be.&rdquo;

   <p>Nevertheless, on systems that support IEEE floating point, it seems
reasonable to provide <em>some</em> way to support NaN and Infinity values. 
The solution implemented in <span class="command">gawk</span>, as of version 3.1.6, is
as follows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>With the <span class="option">--posix</span> command-line option, <span class="command">gawk</span> becomes
&ldquo;hands off.&rdquo; String values are passed directly to the system library's
<code>strtod()</code> function, and if it successfuly returns a numeric value,
that is what's used.  By definition, the results are not portable across
different systems.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-78" name="fnd-78"><sup>78</sup></a>
They are also a little surprising:

     <pre class="example">          $ <kbd>echo nanny | gawk --posix '{ print $1 + 0 }'</kbd>
          -| nan
          $ <kbd>echo 0xDeadBeef | gawk --posix '{ print $1 + 0 }'</kbd>
          -| 3735928559
     </pre>
     <li>Without <span class="option">--posix</span>, <span class="command">gawk</span> interprets the four strings
<span class="samp">+inf</span>,
<span class="samp">-inf</span>,
<span class="samp">+nan</span>,
and
<span class="samp">-nan</span>
specially, producing the corresponding special numeric values. 
The leading sign acts a signal to <span class="command">gawk</span> (and the user)
that the value is really numeric.  Hexadecimal floating point is
not supported (unless you also use <span class="option">--non-decimal-data</span>,
which is <em>not</em> recommended). For example:

     <pre class="example">          $ <kbd>echo nanny | gawk '{ print $1 + 0 }'</kbd>
          -| 0
          $ <kbd>echo +nan | gawk '{ print $1 + 0 }'</kbd>
          -| nan
          $ <kbd>echo 0xDeadBeef | gawk '{ print $1 + 0 }'</kbd>
          -| 0
     </pre>
     <p><span class="command">gawk</span> does ignore case distinction in the four special values. 
Thus <span class="samp">+nan</span> and <span class="samp">+NaN</span> are the same.
        </ol>

     <br><dt>Bit<dd>Short for &ldquo;Binary Digit.&rdquo;
All values in computer memory ultimately reduce to binary digits: values
that are either zero or one. 
Groups of bits may be interpreted differently&mdash;as integers,
floating-point numbers, character data, addresses of other
memory objects, or other data. 
<span class="command">awk</span> lets you work with floating-point numbers and strings. 
<span class="command">gawk</span> lets you manipulate bit values with the built-in
functions described in
<a href="#Bitwise-Functions">Bitwise Functions</a>.

     <p>Computers are often defined by how many bits they use to represent integer
values.  Typical systems are 32-bit systems, but 64-bit systems are
becoming increasingly popular, and 16-bit systems are waning in
popularity.

originally written by Steven R. Bourne. 
Many shells (<span class="command">bash</span>, <span class="command">ksh</span>, <span class="command">pdksh</span>, <span class="command">zsh</span>) are
generally upwardly compatible with the Bourne shell.

     <br><dt>Built-in Function<dd>The <span class="command">awk</span> language provides built-in functions that perform various
numerical, I/O-related, and string computations.  Examples are

statements may be nested. 
(See <a href="#Statements">Statements</a>.)

     <br><dt>Concatenation<dd>Concatenating two strings means sticking them together, one after another,
producing a new string.  For example, the string <span class="samp">foo</span> concatenated with

for the other to perform an action.

     <br><dt>Double-Precision<dd>An internal representation of numbers that can have fractional parts. 
Double-precision numbers keep track of more digits than do single-precision
numbers, but operations on them are sometimes more expensive.  This is the way
<span class="command">awk</span> stores numeric values.  It is the C type <code>double</code>.

     <br><dt>Dynamic Regular Expression<dd>A dynamic regular expression is a regular expression written as an

     <br><dt>FDL<dd>See &ldquo;Free Documentation License.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Field<dd>When <span class="command">awk</span> reads an input record, it splits the record into pieces
separated by whitespace (or by a separator regexp that you can
change by setting the built-in variable <code>FS</code>).  Such pieces are
called fields.  If the pieces are of fixed length, you can use the built-in
variable <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code> to describe their lengths. 
(See <a href="#Field-Separators">Field Separators</a>,
and

some part of the regexp.  Interval expressions were not traditionally available
in <span class="command">awk</span> programs.

     <p><a name="index-ISO-2093"></a><br><dt>ISO<dd>The International Standards Organization. 
This organization produces international standards for many things, including
programming languages, such as C and C++. 
In the computer arena, important standards like those for C, C++, and POSIX
become both American national and ISO international standards simultaneously. 
This Web page refers to Standard C as &ldquo;ISO C&rdquo; throughout.

     <br><dt>Keyword<dd>In the <span class="command">awk</span> language, a keyword is a word that has special
meaning.  Keywords are reserved and may not be used as variable names.

     <p><span class="command">gawk</span>'s keywords are:
<code>BEGIN</code>,
<code>END</code>,
<code>if</code>,
<code>else</code>,
<code>while</code>,
<code>do...while</code>,
<code>for</code>,
<code>for...in</code>,
<code>break</code>,
<code>continue</code>,
<code>delete</code>,
<code>next</code>,
<code>nextfile</code>,
<code>function</code>,
<code>func</code>,
and
<code>exit</code>. 
If <span class="command">gawk</span> was configured with the <span class="option">--enable-switch</span>
option (see <a href="#Switch-Statement">Switch Statement</a>), then
<code>switch</code>,
<code>case</code>,
and
<code>default</code>
are also keywords.

     <br><dt>LGPL<dd>See &ldquo;Lesser General Public License.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Localization<dd>The process of providing the data necessary for an
internationalized program to work in a particular language.

     <br><dt>Logical Expression<dd>An expression using the operators for logic, AND, OR, and NOT, written
<span class="samp">&amp;&amp;</span>, <span class="samp">||</span>, and <span class="samp">!</span> in <span class="command">awk</span>. Often called Boolean
expressions, after the mathematician who pioneered this kind of
mathematical logic.

     <br><dt>Lvalue<dd>An expression that can appear on the left side of an assignment
operator.  In most languages, lvalues can be variables or array
elements.  In <span class="command">awk</span>, a field designator can also be used as an
lvalue.

     <br><dt>Matching<dd>The act of testing a string against a regular expression.  If the
regexp describes the contents of the string, it is said to <dfn>match</dfn> it.

     <br><dt>Metacharacters<dd>Characters used within a regexp that do not stand for themselves. 
Instead, they denote regular expression operations, such as repetition,
grouping, or alternation.

     <br><dt>Null String<dd>A string with no characters in it.  It is represented explicitly in
<span class="command">awk</span> programs by placing two double quote characters next to
each other (<code>""</code>).  It can appear in input data by having two successive
occurrences of the field separator appear next to each other.

     <br><dt>Number<dd>A numeric-valued data object.  Modern <span class="command">awk</span> implementations use
double-precision floating-point to represent numbers. 
Very old <span class="command">awk</span> implementations use single-precision floating-point.

     <br><dt>Octal<dd>Base-eight notation, where the digits are <code>0</code>&ndash;<code>7</code>. 
Octal numbers are written in C using a leading <span class="samp">0</span>,
to indicate their base.  Thus, <code>013</code> is 11 (one times 8 plus 3).

     <p><a name="index-P1003_002e2-POSIX-standard-2097"></a><br><dt>P1003.2<dd>See &ldquo;POSIX.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Pattern<dd>Patterns tell <span class="command">awk</span> which input records are interesting to which
rules.

     <p>A pattern is an arbitrary conditional expression against which input is
tested.  If the condition is satisfied, the pattern is said to <dfn>match</dfn>
the input record.  A typical pattern might compare the input record against
a regular expression. (See <a href="#Pattern-Overview">Pattern Overview</a>.)

     <br><dt>POSIX<dd>The name for a series of standards
<!-- being developed by the IEEE -->
that specify a Portable Operating System interface.  The &ldquo;IX&rdquo; denotes
the Unix heritage of these standards.  The main standard of interest for
<span class="command">awk</span> users is
<cite>IEEE Standard for Information Technology, Standard 1003.2-1992,
Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) Part 2: Shell and Utilities</cite>. 
Informally, this standard is often referred to as simply &ldquo;P1003.2.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Precedence<dd>The order in which operations are performed when operators are used
without explicit parentheses.

     <br><dt>Private<dd>Variables and/or functions that are meant for use exclusively by library
functions and not for the main <span class="command">awk</span> program. Special care must be
taken when naming such variables and functions. 
(See <a href="#Library-Names">Library Names</a>.)

     <br><dt>Range (of input lines)<dd>A sequence of consecutive lines from the input file(s).  A pattern
can specify ranges of input lines for <span class="command">awk</span> to process or it can
specify single lines. (See <a href="#Pattern-Overview">Pattern Overview</a>.)

     <br><dt>Recursion<dd>When a function calls itself, either directly or indirectly. 
If this isn't clear, refer to the entry for &ldquo;recursion.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Redirection<dd>Redirection means performing input from something other than the standard input
stream, or performing output to something other than the standard output stream.

     <p>You can redirect the output of the <code>print</code> and <code>printf</code> statements
to a file or a system command, using the <span class="samp">&gt;</span>, <span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span>, <span class="samp">|</span>, and <span class="samp">|&amp;</span>
operators.  You can redirect input to the <code>getline</code> statement using
the <span class="samp">&lt;</span>, <span class="samp">|</span>, and <span class="samp">|&amp;</span> operators. 
(See <a href="#Redirection">Redirection</a>,
and <a href="#Getline">Getline</a>.)

     <br><dt>Regexp<dd>Short for <dfn>regular expression</dfn>.  A regexp is a pattern that denotes a
set of strings, possibly an infinite set.  For example, the regexp
<span class="samp">R.*xp</span> matches any string starting with the letter <span class="samp">R</span>
and ending with the letters <span class="samp">xp</span>.  In <span class="command">awk</span>, regexps are
used in patterns and in conditional expressions.  Regexps may contain
escape sequences. (See <a href="#Regexp">Regexp</a>.)

     <br><dt>Regular Expression<dd>See &ldquo;regexp.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Regular Expression Constant<dd>A regular expression constant is a regular expression written within
slashes, such as <code>/foo/</code>.  This regular expression is chosen
when you write the <span class="command">awk</span> program and cannot be changed during
its execution. (See <a href="#Regexp-Usage">Regexp Usage</a>.)

     <br><dt>Rule<dd>A segment of an <span class="command">awk</span> program that specifies how to process single
input records.  A rule consists of a <dfn>pattern</dfn> and an <dfn>action</dfn>. 
<span class="command">awk</span> reads an input record; then, for each rule, if the input record
satisfies the rule's pattern, <span class="command">awk</span> executes the rule's action. 
Otherwise, the rule does nothing for that input record.

     <br><dt>Rvalue<dd>A value that can appear on the right side of an assignment operator. 
In <span class="command">awk</span>, essentially every expression has a value. These values
are rvalues.

     <br><dt>Scalar<dd>A single value, be it a number or a string. 
Regular variables are scalars; arrays and functions are not.

     <br><dt>Search Path<dd>In <span class="command">gawk</span>, a list of directories to search for <span class="command">awk</span> program source files. 
In the shell, a list of directories to search for executable programs.

     <br><dt>Seed<dd>The initial value, or starting point, for a sequence of random numbers.

     <br><dt><span class="command">sed</span><dd>See &ldquo;Stream Editor.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Shell<dd>The command interpreter for Unix and POSIX-compliant systems. 
The shell works both interactively, and as a programming language
for batch files, or shell scripts.

     <br><dt>Short-Circuit<dd>The nature of the <span class="command">awk</span> logical operators <span class="samp">&amp;&amp;</span> and <span class="samp">||</span>. 
If the value of the entire expression is determinable from evaluating just
the lefthand side of these operators, the righthand side is not
evaluated. 
(See <a href="#Boolean-Ops">Boolean Ops</a>.)

     <br><dt>Side Effect<dd>A side effect occurs when an expression has an effect aside from merely
producing a value.  Assignment expressions, increment and decrement
expressions, and function calls have side effects. 
(See <a href="#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Ops</a>.)

     <br><dt>Single-Precision<dd>An internal representation of numbers that can have fractional parts. 
Single-precision numbers keep track of fewer digits than do double-precision
numbers, but operations on them are sometimes less expensive in terms of CPU time. 
This is the type used by some very old versions of <span class="command">awk</span> to store
numeric values.  It is the C type <code>float</code>.

     <br><dt>Space<dd>The character generated by hitting the space bar on the keyboard.

     <br><dt>Special File<dd>A file name interpreted internally by <span class="command">gawk</span>, instead of being handed
directly to the underlying operating system&mdash;for example, <span class="file">/dev/stderr</span>. 
(See <a href="#Special-Files">Special Files</a>.)

     <br><dt>Stream Editor<dd>A program that reads records from an input stream and processes them one
or more at a time.  This is in contrast with batch programs, which may
expect to read their input files in entirety before starting to do
anything, as well as with interactive programs which require input from the
user.

     <br><dt>String<dd>A datum consisting of a sequence of characters, such as <span class="samp">I am a
string</span>.  Constant strings are written with double quotes in the
<span class="command">awk</span> language and may contain escape sequences. 
(See <a href="#Escape-Sequences">Escape Sequences</a>.)

     <br><dt>Tab<dd>The character generated by hitting the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key on the keyboard. 
It usually expands to up to eight spaces upon output.

     <br><dt>Text Domain<dd>A unique name that identifies an application. 
Used for grouping messages that are translated at runtime
into the local language.

     <br><dt>Timestamp<dd>A value in the &ldquo;seconds since the epoch&rdquo; format used by Unix
and POSIX systems.  Used for the <span class="command">gawk</span> functions
<code>mktime</code>, <code>strftime</code>, and <code>systime</code>. 
See also &ldquo;Epoch&rdquo; and &ldquo;UTC.&rdquo;

     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   <!-- fakenode - for prepinfo -->
<h3 class="heading">Preamble</h3>

<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

   <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program&mdash;to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You
can apply it to your programs, too.

   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
of others.

   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

   <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. 
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
freedom of users.

   <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL
assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

<!-- fakenode - for prepinfo -->
<h3 class="heading">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>Definitions.

     <p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

     <p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     <p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.

     <p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of
the earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.

     <p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

     <p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

     <p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying.

     <p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo; to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

     <li>Source Code.

     <p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source form
of a work.

     <p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

     <p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

     <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

     <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

     <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

     <li>Basic Permissions.

     <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

     <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. 
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

     <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

     <li>Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

     <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures.

     <li>Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

     <li>Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

          <li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &ldquo;keep intact all
notices&rdquo;.

          <li>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
separately received it.

          <li>If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.
          </ol>

     <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

     <li>Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.

          <li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable
cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

          <li>Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.

          <li>Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. 
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
satisfy these requirements.

          <li>Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.

          </ol>

     <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

     <p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
&ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant
mode of use of the product.

     <p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
solely because modification has been made.

     <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

     <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
network.

     <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

     <li>Additional Terms.

     <p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

     <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

          <li>Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or

          <li>Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

          <li>Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or

          <li>Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or

          <li>Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
          </ol>

     <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

     <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
above requirements apply either way.

     <li>Termination.

     <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

     <li>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

     <li>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

     <p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

     <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

     <li>Patents.

     <p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.

     <p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

     <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

     <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

     <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

     <p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties
who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by
you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

     <li>No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey
a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree
to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the Program.

     <li>Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

     <li>Revised Versions of this License.

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

     <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.

     <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

     <li>Disclaimer of Warranty.

     <p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

     <li>Limitation of Liability.

     <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

     <li>Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     <p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

<h3 class="heading">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</pre>
   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   <p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>program</var> Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type <span class="samp">show w</span>.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type <span class="samp">show c</span> for details.
</pre>
   <p>The hypothetical commands <span class="samp">show w</span> and <span class="samp">show c</span> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.

   <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if necessary. 
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.

   <p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        </ol>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with...Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> These commands
are available on POSIX-compliant systems, as well as on traditional
Unix-based systems. If you are using some other operating system, you still need to
be familiar with the ideas of I/O redirection and pipes.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> Often, these systems
use <span class="command">gawk</span> for their <span class="command">awk</span> implementation!</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> All such differences
appear in the index under the
entry &ldquo;differences in <span class="command">awk</span> and <span class="command">gawk</span>.&rdquo;</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> GNU stands for &ldquo;GNU's not Unix.&rdquo;</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-5" href="#fnd-5">5</a>]</small> The terminology &ldquo;GNU/Linux&rdquo; is explained
in the <a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-6" href="#fnd-6">6</a>]</small> Although we generally recommend the use of single
quotes around the program text, double quotes are needed here in order to
put the single quote into the message.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-7" href="#fnd-7">7</a>]</small> The <span class="samp">#!</span> mechanism works on
Linux systems,
systems derived from the 4.4-Lite Berkeley Software Distribution,
and most commercial Unix systems.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-8" href="#fnd-8">8</a>]</small> The
line beginning with <span class="samp">#!</span> lists the full file name of an interpreter
to run and an optional initial command-line argument to pass to that
interpreter.  The operating system then runs the interpreter with the given
argument and the full argument list of the executed program.  The first argument
in the list is the full file name of the <span class="command">awk</span> program.  The rest of the
argument list contains either options to <span class="command">awk</span>, or data files,
or both.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-9" href="#fnd-9">9</a>]</small> In the C shell (<span class="command">csh</span>), you need to type
a semicolon and then a backslash at the end of the first line; see
<a href="#Statements_002fLines">Statements/Lines</a>, for an
explanation.  In a POSIX-compliant shell, such as the Bourne
shell or <span class="command">bash</span>, you can type the example as shown.  If the command
<span class="samp">echo $path</span> produces an empty output line, you are most likely
using a POSIX-compliant shell.  Otherwise, you are probably using the
C shell or a shell derived from it.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-10" href="#fnd-10">10</a>]</small> On some
very old systems, you may need to use <span class="samp">ls -lg</span> to get this output.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-11" href="#fnd-11">11</a>]</small> The <span class="samp">?</span> and <span class="samp">:</span> referred to here is the
three-operand conditional expression described in
<a href="#Conditional-Exp">Conditional Exp</a>. 
Splitting lines after <span class="samp">?</span> and <span class="samp">:</span> is a minor <span class="command">gawk</span>
extension; if <span class="option">--posix</span> is specified
(see <a href="#Options">Options</a>), then this extension is disabled.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-12" href="#fnd-12">12</a>]</small> <a href="http://www.awk-scripting.de/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi/yawk/">Yet Another Wiki Clone</a>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-13" href="#fnd-13">13</a>]</small> In other literature,
you may see a character list referred to as either a
<dfn>character set</dfn>, a <dfn>character class</dfn>, or a <dfn>bracket expression</dfn>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-14" href="#fnd-14">14</a>]</small> Use two backslashes if you're
using a string constant with a regexp operator or function.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-15" href="#fnd-15">15</a>]</small> Experienced C and C++ programmers will note
that it is possible, using something like
<span class="samp">IGNORECASE = 1 &amp;&amp; /foObAr/ { ... }</span>
and
<span class="samp">IGNORECASE = 0 || /foobar/ { ... }</span>. 
However, this is somewhat obscure and we don't recommend it.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-16" href="#fnd-16">16</a>]</small> At least that we know
about.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-17" href="#fnd-17">17</a>]</small> In POSIX <span class="command">awk</span>, newlines are not
considered whitespace for separating fields.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-18" href="#fnd-18">18</a>]</small> The <span class="command">sed</span> utility is a &ldquo;stream editor.&rdquo;
Its behavior is also defined by the POSIX standard.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-19" href="#fnd-19">19</a>]</small> When <code>FS</code> is the null string (<code>""</code>)
or a regexp, this special feature of <code>RS</code> does not apply. 
It does apply to the default field separator of a single space:
<span class="samp">FS = " "</span>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-20" href="#fnd-20">20</a>]</small> Older versions of
<span class="command">gawk</span> would interpret these names internally only if the system
did not actually have a <span class="file">/dev/fd</span> directory or any of the other
special files listed earlier.  Usually this didn't make a difference,
but sometimes it did; thus, it was decided to make <span class="command">gawk</span>'s
behavior consistent on all systems and to have it always interpret
the special file names itself.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-21" href="#fnd-21">21</a>]</small> The technical terminology is rather morbid. 
The finished child is called a &ldquo;zombie,&rdquo; and cleaning up after
it is referred to as &ldquo;reaping.&rdquo;</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-22" href="#fnd-22">22</a>]</small> 
This is a full 16-bit value as returned by the <code>wait</code>
system call. See the system manual pages for information on
how to decode this value.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-23" href="#fnd-23">23</a>]</small> The internal representation of all numbers,
including integers, uses double-precision
floating-point numbers. 
On most modern systems, these are in IEEE 754 standard format.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-24" href="#fnd-24">24</a>]</small> Pathological cases can require up to
752 digits (!), but we doubt that you need to worry about this.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-25" href="#fnd-25">25</a>]</small> It happens
that <span class="command">gawk</span> and <span class="command">mawk</span> &ldquo;get it right,&rdquo; but you should
not rely on this.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-26" href="#fnd-26">26</a>]</small> The POSIX standard has
been revised.  The revised standard's rules for typing and comparison are
the same as just described for <span class="command">gawk</span>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-27" href="#fnd-27">27</a>]</small> This
program has a bug; it prints lines starting with <span class="samp">END</span>. How
would you fix it?</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-28" href="#fnd-28">28</a>]</small> The original version of <span class="command">awk</span> used to keep
reading and ignoring input until the end of the file was seen.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-29" href="#fnd-29">29</a>]</small> In
POSIX <span class="command">awk</span>, newline does not count as whitespace.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-30" href="#fnd-30">30</a>]</small> Some early implementations of Unix <span class="command">awk</span> initialized
<code>FILENAME</code> to <code>"-"</code>, even if there were data files to be
processed. This behavior was incorrect and should not be relied
upon in your programs.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-31" href="#fnd-31">31</a>]</small> Thanks to Michael Brennan for pointing this out.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-32" href="#fnd-32">32</a>]</small> The C version of <code>rand</code>
is known to produce fairly poor sequences of random numbers. 
However, nothing requires that an <span class="command">awk</span> implementation use the C
<code>rand</code> to implement the <span class="command">awk</span> version of <code>rand</code>. 
In fact, <span class="command">gawk</span> uses the BSD <code>random</code> function, which is
considerably better than <code>rand</code>, to produce random numbers.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-33" href="#fnd-33">33</a>]</small> Computer-generated random numbers really are not truly
random.  They are technically known as &ldquo;pseudorandom.&rdquo;  This means
that while the numbers in a sequence appear to be random, you can in
fact generate the same sequence of random numbers over and over again.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-34" href="#fnd-34">34</a>]</small> Unless
you use the <span class="option">--non-decimal-data</span> option, which isn't recommended. 
See <a href="#Nondecimal-Data">Nondecimal Data</a>, for more information.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-35" href="#fnd-35">35</a>]</small> Note that this means
that the record will first be regenerated using the value of <code>OFS</code> if
any fields have been changed, and that the fields will be updated
after the substitution, even if the operation is a &ldquo;no-op&rdquo; such
as <span class="samp">sub(/^/, "")</span>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-36" href="#fnd-36">36</a>]</small> This is different from
C and C++, in which the first character is number zero.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-37" href="#fnd-37">37</a>]</small> This consequence was certainly unintended.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-38" href="#fnd-38">38</a>]</small> A program is interactive
if the standard output is connected
to a terminal device.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-39" href="#fnd-39">39</a>]</small> See <a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a>,
especially the entries &ldquo;Epoch&rdquo; and &ldquo;UTC.&rdquo;</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-40" href="#fnd-40">40</a>]</small> The GNU <span class="command">date</span> utility can
also do many of the things described here.  Its use may be preferable
for simple time-related operations in shell scripts.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-41" href="#fnd-41">41</a>]</small> Occasionally there are
minutes in a year with a leap second, which is why the
seconds can go up to 60.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-42" href="#fnd-42">42</a>]</small> As this
is a recent standard, not every system's <code>strftime</code> necessarily
supports all of the conversions listed here.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-43" href="#fnd-43">43</a>]</small> If you don't understand any of this, don't worry about
it; these facilities are meant to make it easier to &ldquo;internationalize&rdquo;
programs. 
Other internationalization features are described in
<a href="#Internationalization">Internationalization</a>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-44" href="#fnd-44">44</a>]</small> This is because ISO C leaves the
behavior of the C version of <code>strftime</code> undefined and <span class="command">gawk</span>
uses the system's version of <code>strftime</code> if it's there. 
Typically, the conversion specifier either does not appear in the
returned string or appears literally.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-45" href="#fnd-45">45</a>]</small> This example
shows that 0's come in on the left side. For <span class="command">gawk</span>, this is
always true, but in some languages, it's possible to have the left side
fill with 1's. Caveat emptor.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-46" href="#fnd-46">46</a>]</small> For some operating systems, the <span class="command">gawk</span>
port doesn't support GNU <code>gettext</code>.  This applies most notably to
the PC operating systems.  As such, these features are not available
if you are using one of those operating systems.  Sorry.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-47" href="#fnd-47">47</a>]</small> Americans
use a comma every three decimal places and a period for the decimal
point, while many Europeans do exactly the opposite:
<code>1,234.56</code> versus <code>1.234,56</code>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-48" href="#fnd-48">48</a>]</small> Starting with <code>gettext</code>
version 0.11.5, the <span class="command">xgettext</span> utility that comes with GNU
<code>gettext</code> can handle <span class="file">.awk</span> files.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-49" href="#fnd-49">49</a>]</small> This example is borrowed
from the GNU <code>gettext</code> manual.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-50" href="#fnd-50">50</a>]</small> This is good fodder for an &ldquo;Obfuscated
<span class="command">awk</span>&rdquo; contest.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-51" href="#fnd-51">51</a>]</small> Perhaps it would be better if it were
called &ldquo;Hippy.&rdquo; Ah, well.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-52" href="#fnd-52">52</a>]</small> This is very
different from the same operator in the C shell, <span class="command">csh</span>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-53" href="#fnd-53">53</a>]</small> Not recommended.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-54" href="#fnd-54">54</a>]</small> Your version of <span class="command">gawk</span>
may use a different directory; it
will depend upon how <span class="command">gawk</span> was built and installed. The actual
directory is the value of <span class="samp">$(datadir)</span> generated when
<span class="command">gawk</span> was configured.  You probably don't need to worry about this,
though.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-55" href="#fnd-55">55</a>]</small> The effects are
not identical.  Output of the transformed
record will be in all lowercase, while <code>IGNORECASE</code> preserves the original
contents of the input record.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-56" href="#fnd-56">56</a>]</small> While all the library routines could have
been rewritten to use this convention, this was not done, in order to
show how my own <span class="command">awk</span> programming style has evolved and to
provide some basis for this discussion.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-57" href="#fnd-57">57</a>]</small> <span class="command">gawk</span>'s <span class="option">--dump-variables</span> command-line
option is useful for verifying this.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-58" href="#fnd-58">58</a>]</small> <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CliffRandomNumberGenerator.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CliffRandomNumberGenerator.html</a></p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-59" href="#fnd-59">59</a>]</small> ASCII
has been extended in many countries to use the values from 128 to 255
for country-specific characters.  If your  system uses these extensions,
you can simplify <code>_ord_init</code> to simply loop from 0 to 255.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-60" href="#fnd-60">60</a>]</small> It would
be nice if <span class="command">awk</span> had an assignment operator for concatenation. 
The lack of an explicit operator for concatenation makes string operations
more difficult than they really need to be.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-61" href="#fnd-61">61</a>]</small> This
function was written before <span class="command">gawk</span> acquired the ability to
split strings into single characters using <code>""</code> as the separator. 
We have left it alone, since using <code>substr</code> is more portable.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-62" href="#fnd-62">62</a>]</small> It is often the case that password
information is stored in a network database.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-63" href="#fnd-63">63</a>]</small> It
also introduces a subtle bug;
if a match happens, we output the translated line, not the original.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-64" href="#fnd-64">64</a>]</small> <span class="command">wc</span> can't just use the value of
<code>FNR</code> in <code>endfile</code>. If you examine
the code in
<a href="#Filetrans-Function">Filetrans Function</a>,
you will see that
<code>FNR</code> has already been reset by the time
<code>endfile</code> is called.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-65" href="#fnd-65">65</a>]</small> On some older
System V systems,
<span class="command">tr</span> may require that the lists be written as
range expressions enclosed in square brackets (<span class="samp">[a-z]</span>) and quoted,
to prevent the shell from attempting a file name expansion.  This is
not a feature.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-66" href="#fnd-66">66</a>]</small> This
program was written before <span class="command">gawk</span> acquired the ability to
split each character in a string into separate array elements.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-67" href="#fnd-67">67</a>]</small> &ldquo;Real world&rdquo; is defined as
&ldquo;a program actually used to get something done.&rdquo;</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-68" href="#fnd-68">68</a>]</small> Fully explaining the <span class="command">sh</span> language is beyond
the scope of this book. We provide some minimal explanations, but see
a good shell programming book if you wish to understand things in more
depth.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-69" href="#fnd-69">69</a>]</small> On some very old versions of <span class="command">awk</span>, the test
<span class="samp">getline junk &lt; t</span> can loop forever if the file exists but is empty. 
Caveat emptor.</p>
