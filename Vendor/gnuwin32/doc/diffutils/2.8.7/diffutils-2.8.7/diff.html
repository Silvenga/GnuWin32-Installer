<h2 class="unnumbered">Overview</h2>

<p>Computer users often find occasion to ask how two files differ.  Perhaps
one file is a newer version of the other file.  Or maybe the two files
started out as identical copies but were changed by different people.

   <p>You can use the <code>diff</code> command to show differences between two
files, or each corresponding file in two directories.  <code>diff</code>
outputs differences between files line by line in any of several
formats, selectable by command line options.  This set of differences is
often called a <dfn>diff</dfn> or <dfn>patch</dfn>.  For files that are identical,
<code>diff</code> normally produces no output; for binary (non-text) files,
<code>diff</code> normally reports only that they are different.

   <p>You can use the <code>cmp</code> command to show the byte and line numbers
where two files differ.  <code>cmp</code> can also show all the bytes
that differ between the two files, side by side.  A way to compare
two files character by character is the Emacs command <kbd>M-x
compare-windows</kbd>.  See <a href="emacs.html#Other%20Window">Other Window</a>, for more information on that command.

   <p>You can use the <code>diff3</code> command to show differences among three
files.  When two people have made independent changes to a common
original, <code>diff3</code> can report the differences between the original
and the two changed versions, and can produce a merged file that
contains both persons' changes together with warnings about conflicts.

   <p>You can use the <code>sdiff</code> command to merge two files interactively.

   <p>You can use the set of differences produced by <code>diff</code> to distribute
updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people. 
This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
to the complete files.  Given <code>diff</code> output, you can use the
<code>patch</code> program to update, or <dfn>patch</dfn>, a copy of the file.  If you
think of <code>diff</code> as subtracting one file from another to produce
their difference, you can think of <code>patch</code> as adding the difference
to one file to reproduce the other.

   <p>This manual first concentrates on making diffs, and later shows how to
use diffs to update files.

   <p><small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> was written by Paul Eggert, Mike Haertel,
David Hayes, Richard Stallman, and Len Tower.  Wayne Davison designed and
implemented the unified output format.  The basic algorithm is described
by Eugene W. Myers in "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations",
<cite>Algorithmica</cite> Vol. 1 No. 2, 1986, pp. 251-266; and in "A File
Comparison Program", Webb Miller and Eugene W. Myers,
<cite>Software--Practice and Experience</cite> Vol. 15 No. 11, 1985,
pp. 1025-1040. 
The algorithm was independently discovered as described by E. Ukkonen in
"Algorithms for Approximate String Matching",
<cite>Information and Control</cite> Vol. 64, 1985, pp. 100-118. 
Unless the <code>--minimal</code> option is used, <code>diff</code> uses a
heuristic by Paul Eggert that limits the cost to O(N^1.5 log N)
at the price of producing suboptimal output for large inputs with many
differences.  Related algorithms are surveyed by Alfred V. Aho in
section 6.3 of "Algorithms for Finding Patterns in Strings",
<cite>Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science</cite> (Jan Van Leeuwen,
ed.), Vol. A, <cite>Algorithms and Complexity</cite>, Elsevier/MIT Press,
1990, pp. 255-300.

   <p><small>GNU</small> <code>diff3</code> was written by Randy Smith.  <small>GNU</small>
<code>sdiff</code> was written by Thomas Lord.  <small>GNU</small> <code>cmp</code>
was written by Torbj&ouml;rn Granlund and David MacKenzie.

   <p><small>GNU</small> <code>patch</code> was written mainly by Larry Wall and Paul Eggert;
several <small>GNU</small> enhancements were contributed by Wayne Davison and
David MacKenzie.  Parts of this manual are adapted from a manual page

<h2 class="chapter">1 What Comparison Means</h2>

<p>There are several ways to think about the differences between two files. 
One way to think of the differences is as a series of lines that were
deleted from, inserted in, or changed in one file to produce the other
file.  <code>diff</code> compares two files line by line, finds groups of
lines that differ, and reports each group of differing lines.  It can
report the differing lines in several formats, which have different
purposes.

   <p><small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> can show whether files are different
without detailing the differences.  It also provides ways to suppress
certain kinds of differences that are not important to you.  Most
commonly, such differences are changes in the amount of white space
between words or lines.  <code>diff</code> also provides ways to suppress
differences in alphabetic case or in lines that match a regular
expression that you provide.  These options can accumulate; for
example, you can ignore changes in both white space and alphabetic
case.

   <p>Another way to think of the differences between two files is as a
sequence of pairs of bytes that can be either identical or
different.  <code>cmp</code> reports the differences between two files
byte by byte, instead of line by line.  As a result, it is often
more useful than <code>diff</code> for comparing binary files.  For text
files, <code>cmp</code> is useful mainly when you want to know only whether
two files are identical, or whether one file is a prefix of the other.

   <p>To illustrate the effect that considering changes byte by byte
can have compared with considering them line by line, think of what
happens if a single newline character is added to the beginning of a
file.  If that file is then compared with an otherwise identical file
that lacks the newline at the beginning, <code>diff</code> will report that a
blank line has been added to the file, while <code>cmp</code> will report that
almost every byte of the two files differs.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Hunks</h3>

<p>When comparing two files, <code>diff</code> finds sequences of lines common to
both files, interspersed with groups of differing lines called
<dfn>hunks</dfn>.  Comparing two identical files yields one sequence of
common lines and no hunks, because no lines differ.  Comparing two
entirely different files yields no common lines and one large hunk that
contains all lines of both files.  In general, there are many ways to
match up lines between two given files.  <code>diff</code> tries to minimize
the total hunk size by finding large sequences of common lines
interspersed with small hunks of differing lines.

   <p>For example, suppose the file <code>F</code> contains the three lines
<code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, and the file <code>G</code> contains the same
three lines in reverse order <code>c</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>a</code>.  If
<code>diff</code> finds the line <code>c</code> as common, then the command
<code>diff F G</code> produces this output:

<pre class="example">     1,2d0
     &lt; a
     &lt; b
     3a2,3
     &gt; b
     &gt; a
     </pre>

<p>But if <code>diff</code> notices the common line <code>b</code> instead, it produces
this output:

<pre class="example">     1c1
     &lt; a
     ---
     &gt; c
     3c3
     &lt; c
     ---
     &gt; a
     </pre>

<p>It is also possible to find <code>a</code> as the common line.  <code>diff</code>
does not always find an optimal matching between the files; it takes
shortcuts to run faster.  But its output is usually close to the
shortest possible.  You can adjust this tradeoff with the
<code>-d</code> or <code>--minimal</code> option (see <a href="#diff%20Performance">diff Performance</a>).

<h3 class="section">1.2 Suppressing Differences in Blank and Tab Spacing</h3>

<p>The <code>-E</code> or <code>--ignore-tab-expansion</code> option ignores the
distinction between tabs and spaces on input.  A tab is considered to be
equivalent to the number of spaces to the next tab stop (see <a href="#Tabs">Tabs</a>).

   <p>The <code>-b</code> or <code>--ignore-space-change</code> option is stronger. 
It ignores white space at line end, and considers all other sequences of
one or more white space characters within a line to be equivalent.  With this
option, <code>diff</code> considers the following two lines to be equivalent,
where <code>$</code> denotes the line end:

<pre class="example">     Here lyeth  muche rychnesse  in lytell space.   -- John Heywood$
     Here lyeth muche rychnesse in lytell space. -- John Heywood   $
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>-w</code> or <code>--ignore-all-space</code> option is stronger still. 
It ignores differences even if one line has white space where
the other line has none.  <dfn>White space</dfn> characters include
tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, and space;
some locales may define additional characters to be white space. 
With this option, <code>diff</code> considers the
following two lines to be equivalent, where <code>$</code> denotes the line
end and <code>^M</code> denotes a carriage return:

<pre class="example">     Here lyeth  muche  rychnesse in lytell space.--  John Heywood$
       He relyeth much erychnes  seinly tells pace.  --John Heywood   ^M$

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.3 Suppressing Differences Whose Lines Are All Blank</h3>

<p>The <code>-B</code> or <code>--ignore-blank-lines</code> option ignores changes
that consist entirely of blank lines.  With this option, for example, a
file containing
<pre class="example">     1.  A point is that which has no part.
     
     2.  A line is breadthless length.
     -- Euclid, The Elements, I
     </pre>

<p>is considered identical to a file containing
<pre class="example">     1.  A point is that which has no part.
     2.  A line is breadthless length.
     
     
     -- Euclid, The Elements, I
     </pre>

   <p>Normally this option affects only lines that are completely empty, but
if you also specify the <code>-b</code> or <code>--ignore-space-change</code>
option, or the <code>-w</code> or <code>--ignore-all-space</code> option,
lines are also affected if they look empty but contain white space. 
In other words, <code>-B</code> is equivalent to <code>-I '^$'</code> by
default, but it is equivalent to <code>-I '^[[:space:]]*$'</code> if
<code>-b</code> or <code>-w</code> is also specified.

<h3 class="section">1.4 Suppressing Differences Whose Lines All Match a Regular Expression</h3>

<p>To ignore insertions and deletions of lines that match a
<code>grep</code>-style regular expression, use the <code>-I
</code><var>regexp</var><code></code> or <code>--ignore-matching-lines=</code><var>regexp</var><code></code> option. 
You should escape
regular expressions that contain shell metacharacters to prevent the
shell from expanding them.  For example, <code>diff -I '^[[:digit:]]'</code> ignores
all changes to lines beginning with a digit.

   <p>However, <code>-I</code> only ignores the insertion or deletion of lines that
contain the regular expression if every changed line in the hunk--every
insertion and every deletion--matches the regular expression.  In other
words, for each nonignorable change, <code>diff</code> prints the complete set
of changes in its vicinity, including the ignorable ones.

   <p>You can specify more than one regular expression for lines to ignore by
using more than one <code>-I</code> option.  <code>diff</code> tries to match each
line against each regular expression.

<h3 class="section">1.5 Suppressing Case Differences</h3>

<p><small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> can treat lower case letters as

considers <code>Funky Stuff</code>, <code>funky STUFF</code>, and <code>fUNKy
stuFf</code> to all be the same.  To request this, use the <code>-i</code> or

<h3 class="section">1.6 Summarizing Which Files Differ</h3>

<p>When you only want to find out whether files are different, and you
don't care what the differences are, you can use the summary output
format.  In this format, instead of showing the differences between the
files, <code>diff</code> simply reports whether files differ.  The <code>-q</code>
or <code>--brief</code> option selects this output format.

   <p>This format is especially useful when comparing the contents of two
directories.  It is also much faster than doing the normal line by line
comparisons, because <code>diff</code> can stop analyzing the files as soon as
it knows that there are any differences.

   <p>You can also get a brief indication of whether two files differ by using
<code>cmp</code>.  For files that are identical, <code>cmp</code> produces no
output.  When the files differ, by default, <code>cmp</code> outputs the byte
and line number where the first difference occurs, or reports that one
file is a prefix of the other.  You can use
the <code>-s</code>, <code>--quiet</code>, or <code>--silent</code> option to
suppress that information, so that <code>cmp</code>
produces no output and reports whether the files differ using only its
exit status (see <a href="#Invoking%20cmp">Invoking cmp</a>).

   <p>Unlike <code>diff</code>, <code>cmp</code> cannot compare directories; it can only
compare two files.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Comparison">Comparison</a>
<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">1.7 Binary Files and Forcing Text Comparisons</h3>

<p>If <code>diff</code> thinks that either of the two files it is comparing is
binary (a non-text file), it normally treats that pair of files much as
if the summary output format had been selected (see <a href="#Brief">Brief</a>), and
reports only that the binary files are different.  This is because line
by line comparisons are usually not meaningful for binary files.

   <p><code>diff</code> determines whether a file is text or binary by checking the
first few bytes in the file; the exact number of bytes is system
dependent, but it is typically several thousand.  If every byte in
that part of the file is non-null, <code>diff</code> considers the file to be
text; otherwise it considers the file to be binary.

   <p>Sometimes you might want to force <code>diff</code> to consider files to be
text.  For example, you might be comparing text files that contain
null characters; <code>diff</code> would erroneously decide that those are
non-text files.  Or you might be comparing documents that are in a
format used by a word processing system that uses null characters to
indicate special formatting.  You can force <code>diff</code> to consider all
files to be text files, and compare them line by line, by using the
<code>-a</code> or <code>--text</code> option.  If the files you compare using this
option do not in fact contain text, they will probably contain few
newline characters, and the <code>diff</code> output will consist of hunks
showing differences between long lines of whatever characters the files
contain.

   <p>You can also force <code>diff</code> to report only whether files differ
(but not how).  Use the <code>-q</code> or <code>--brief</code> option for
this.

   <p>Normally, differing binary files count as trouble because the
resulting <code>diff</code> output does not capture all the differences. 
This trouble causes <code>diff</code> to exit with status 2.  However,
this trouble cannot occur with the <code>-a</code> or <code>--text</code>
option, or with the <code>-q</code> or <code>--brief</code> option, as these
options both cause <code>diff</code> to generate a form of output that
represents differences as requested.

   <p>In operating systems that distinguish between text and binary files,
<code>diff</code> normally reads and writes all data as text.  Use the
<code>--binary</code> option to force <code>diff</code> to read and write binary
data instead.  This option has no effect on a <small>POSIX</small>-compliant system
like <small>GNU</small> or traditional Unix.  However, many personal computer
operating systems represent the end of a line with a carriage return
followed by a newline.  On such systems, <code>diff</code> normally ignores
these carriage returns on input and generates them at the end of each
output line, but with the <code>--binary</code> option <code>diff</code> treats
each carriage return as just another input character, and does not
generate a carriage return at the end of each output line.  This can be
useful when dealing with non-text files that are meant to be
interchanged with <small>POSIX</small>-compliant systems.

   <p>The <code>--strip-trailing-cr</code> causes <code>diff</code> to treat input
lines that end in carriage return followed by newline as if they end
in plain newline.  This can be useful when comparing text that is
imperfectly imported from many personal computer operating systems. 
This option affects how lines are read, which in turn affects how they
are compared and output.

   <p>If you want to compare two files byte by byte, you can use the
<code>cmp</code> program with the <code>-l</code> or <code>--verbose</code>
option to show the values of each differing byte in the two files. 
With <small>GNU</small> <code>cmp</code>, you can also use the <code>-b</code> or
<code>--print-bytes</code> option to show the <small>ASCII</small> representation of
those bytes.  See <a href="#Invoking%20cmp">Invoking cmp</a>, for more information.

   <p>If <code>diff3</code> thinks that any of the files it is comparing is binary
(a non-text file), it normally reports an error, because such
comparisons are usually not useful.  <code>diff3</code> uses the same test as
<code>diff</code> to decide whether a file is binary.  As with <code>diff</code>, if
the input files contain a few non-text bytes but otherwise are like
text files, you can force <code>diff3</code> to consider all files to be text
files and compare them line by line by using the <code>-a</code> or
<code>--text</code> option.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Two Sample Input Files</h3>

<p>Here are two sample files that we will use in numerous examples to
illustrate the output of <code>diff</code> and how various options can change
it.

   <p>This is the file <code>lao</code>:

<pre class="example">     The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
     The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
     The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
     The Named is the mother of all things.
     Therefore let there always be non-being,
       so we may see their subtlety,
     And let there always be being,
       so we may see their outcome.
     The two are the same,
     But after they are produced,
       they have different names.
     </pre>

   <p>This is the file <code>tzu</code>:

<pre class="example">     The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
     The named is the mother of all things.
     
     Therefore let there always be non-being,
       so we may see their subtlety,
     And let there always be being,
       so we may see their outcome.
     The two are the same,
     But after they are produced,
       they have different names.
     They both may be called deep and profound.
     Deeper and more profound,
     The door of all subtleties!
     </pre>

   <p>In this example, the first hunk contains just the first two lines of
<code>lao</code>, the second hunk contains the fourth line of <code>lao</code>
opposing the second and third lines of <code>tzu</code>, and the last hunk
contains just the last three lines of <code>tzu</code>.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Showing Differences in Their Context</h3>

<p>Usually, when you are looking at the differences between files, you will
also want to see the parts of the files near the lines that differ, to
help you understand exactly what has changed.  These nearby parts of the
files are called the <dfn>context</dfn>.

   <p><small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> provides two output formats that show context
around the differing lines: <dfn>context format</dfn> and <dfn>unified
format</dfn>.  It can optionally show in which function or section of the
file the differing lines are found.

   <p>If you are distributing new versions of files to other people in the
form of <code>diff</code> output, you should use one of the output formats
that show context so that they can apply the diffs even if they have
made small changes of their own to the files.  <code>patch</code> can apply
the diffs in this case by searching in the files for the lines of
context around the differing lines; if those lines are actually a few
lines away from where the diff says they are, <code>patch</code> can adjust
the line numbers accordingly and still apply the diff correctly. 
See <a href="#Imperfect">Imperfect</a>, for more information on using <code>patch</code> to apply
imperfect diffs.

<h3 class="subsection">2.2.1 Context Format</h4>

<p>The context output format shows several lines of context around the
lines that differ.  It is the standard format for distributing updates
to source code.

   <p>To select this output format, use the <code>-C </code><var>lines</var><code></code>,
<code>--context</code>[<code>=</code><var>lines</var><code></code>]<code></code>, or <code>-c</code> option.  The
argument <var>lines</var> that some of these options take is the number of
lines of context to show.  If you do not specify <var>lines</var>, it
defaults to three.  For proper operation, <code>patch</code> typically needs
at least two lines of context.

<p>The time stamp normally looks like <code>2002-02-21 23:30:39.942229878
-0800</code> to indicate the date, time with fractional seconds, and time
zone in <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2822.txt">Internet RFC 2822 format</a>.  (The fractional seconds are omitted on hosts that do
not support fractional time stamps.)  However, a traditional time
stamp like <code>Thu Feb 21 23:30:39 2002</code> is used if the
<code>LC_TIME</code> locale category is either <code>C</code> or <code>POSIX</code>.

   <p>You can change the header's content with the
<code>--label=</code><var>label</var><code></code> option; see <a href="#Alternate%20Names">Alternate Names</a>.

   <p>Next come one or more hunks of differences; each hunk shows one area
where the files differ.  Context format hunks look like this:

<pre class="example">     ***************
     *** <var>from-file-line-numbers</var> ****
       <var>from-file-line</var>
       <var>from-file-line</var>...

       <var>to-file-line</var>
       <var>to-file-line</var>...
     </pre>

   <p>If a hunk contains two or more lines, its line numbers look like
<code></code><var>start</var><code>,</code><var>end</var><code></code>.  Otherwise only its end line number
appears.  An empty hunk is considered to end at the line that precedes
the hunk.

   <p>The lines of context around the lines that differ start with two space
characters.  The lines that differ between the two files start with one
of the following indicator characters, followed by a space character:

     <dl>
<dt><code>!</code>
     <dd>A line that is part of a group of one or more lines that changed between
the two files.  There is a corresponding group of lines marked with
<code>!</code> in the part of this hunk for the other file.

     <br><dt><code>+</code>
     <dd>An "inserted" line in the second file that corresponds to nothing in
the first file.

     <br><dt><code>-</code>
     <dd>A "deleted" line in the first file that corresponds to nothing in the
second file. 
</dl>

   <p>If all of the changes in a hunk are insertions, the lines of
<var>from-file</var> are omitted.  If all of the changes are deletions, the
lines of <var>to-file</var> are omitted.

<p>The unified output format is a variation on the context format that is
more compact because it omits redundant context lines.  To select this
output format, use the <code>-U </code><var>lines</var><code></code>,
<code>--unified</code>[<code>=</code><var>lines</var><code></code>]<code></code>, or <code>-u</code>
option.  The argument <var>lines</var> is the number of lines of context to
show.  When it is not given, it defaults to three.

   <p>At present, only <small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> can produce this format and
only <small>GNU</small> <code>patch</code> can automatically apply diffs in this
format.  For proper operation, <code>patch</code> typically needs at
least three lines of context.

<h3 class="subsubsection">2.2.2.2 Detailed Description of Unified Format</h5>

<p>The unified output format starts with a two-line header, which looks
like this:

     +++ <var>to-file</var> <var>to-file-modification-time</var>

<p>The time stamp looks like <code>2002-02-21 23:30:39.942229878 -0800</code>
to indicate the date, time with fractional seconds, and time zone. 
The fractional seconds are omitted on hosts that do not support
fractional time stamps.

   <p>You can change the header's content with the
<code>--label=</code><var>label</var><code></code> option; see See <a href="#Alternate%20Names">Alternate Names</a>.

   <p>Next come one or more hunks of differences; each hunk shows one area
where the files differ.  Unified format hunks look like this:

<pre class="example">     @@ <var>from-file-line-numbers</var> <var>to-file-line-numbers</var> @@
      <var>line-from-either-file</var>
      <var>line-from-either-file</var>...
     </pre>

   <p>If a hunk contains just one line, only its start line number appears. 
Otherwise its line numbers look like <code></code><var>start</var><code>,</code><var>count</var><code></code>. 
An empty hunk is considered to start at the line that follows the hunk.

   <p>If a hunk and its context contain two or more lines, its
line numbers look like <code></code><var>start</var><code>,</code><var>count</var><code></code>.  Otherwise only
its end line number appears.  An empty hunk is considered to end at
the line that precedes the hunk.

   <p>The lines common to both files begin with a space character.  The lines
that actually differ between the two files have one of the following
indicator characters in the left print column:

     <dl>
<dt><code>+</code>
     <dd>A line was added here to the first file.

     <br><dt><code>-</code>

<h3 class="subsection">2.2.3 Showing Which Sections Differences Are in</h4>

<p>Sometimes you might want to know which part of the files each change
falls in.  If the files are source code, this could mean which
function was changed.  If the files are documents, it could mean which
chapter or appendix was changed.  <small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> can
show this by displaying the nearest section heading line that precedes
the differing lines.  Which lines are "section headings" is
determined by a regular expression.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#Specified%20Headings">Specified Headings</a>:   Showing headings that match regular expressions. 
<li><a accesskey="2" href="#C%20Function%20Headings">C Function Headings</a>:  Showing headings of C functions.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">2.2.3.1 Showing Lines That Match Regular Expressions</h5>

<p>To show in which sections differences occur for files that are not
source code for C or similar languages, use the <code>-F </code><var>regexp</var><code></code>
or <code>--show-function-line=</code><var>regexp</var><code></code> option.  <code>diff</code>
considers lines that match the <code>grep</code>-style regular expression
<var>regexp</var> to be the beginning
of a section of the file.  Here are suggested regular expressions for
some common languages:

     <dl>
<dt><code>^[[:alpha:]$_]</code>
     <dd>C, C++, Prolog
<br><dt><code>^(</code>
     <dd>Lisp
<br><dt><code>^@node</code>
     <dd>Texinfo
</dl>

   <p>This option does not automatically select an output format; in order to
use it, you must select the context format (see <a href="#Context%20Format">Context Format</a>) or
unified format (see <a href="#Unified%20Format">Unified Format</a>).  In other output formats it
has no effect.

   <p>The <code>-F</code> or <code>--show-function-line</code> option finds the nearest
unchanged line that precedes each hunk of differences and matches the
given regular expression.  Then it adds that line to the end of the
line of asterisks in the context format, or to the <code>@@</code> line in
unified format.  If no matching line exists, this option leaves the output for
that hunk unchanged.  If that line is more than 40 characters long, it
outputs only the first 40 characters.  You can specify more than one
regular expression for such lines; <code>diff</code> tries to match each line
against each regular expression, starting with the last one given.  This
means that you can use <code>-p</code> and <code>-F</code> together, if you wish.

<h3 class="subsubsection">2.2.3.2 Showing C Function Headings</h5>

<p>To show in which functions differences occur for C and similar
languages, you can use the <code>-p</code> or <code>--show-c-function</code> option. 
This option automatically defaults to the context output format
(see <a href="#Context%20Format">Context Format</a>), with the default number of lines of context. 
You can override that number with <code>-C </code><var>lines</var><code></code> elsewhere in the
command line.  You can override both the format and the number with
<code>-U </code><var>lines</var><code></code> elsewhere in the command line.

   <p>The <code>-p</code> or <code>--show-c-function</code> option is equivalent to
<code>-F '^[[:alpha:]$_]'</code> if the unified format is specified, otherwise
<code>-c -F '^[[:alpha:]$_]'</code> (see <a href="#Specified%20Headings">Specified Headings</a>).  <small>GNU</small>
<code>diff</code> provides this option for the sake of convenience.

<h3 class="subsection">2.2.4 Showing Alternate File Names</h4>

<p>If you are comparing two files that have meaningless or uninformative
names, you might want <code>diff</code> to show alternate names in the header
of the context and unified output formats.  To do this, use the
<code>--label=</code><var>label</var><code></code> option.  The first time
you give this option, its argument replaces the name and date of the
first file in the header; the second time, its argument replaces the
name and date of the second file.  If you give this option more than
twice, <code>diff</code> reports an error.  The <code>--label</code> option does not
affect the file names in the <code>pr</code> header when the <code>-l</code> or
<code>--paginate</code> option is used (see <a href="#Pagination">Pagination</a>).

   <p>Here are the first two lines of the output from <code>diff -C 2

<h3 class="section">2.3 Showing Differences Side by Side</h3>

<p><code>diff</code> can produce a side by side difference listing of two files. 
The files are listed in two columns with a gutter between them.  The
gutter contains one of the following markers:

     <dl>
<dt>white space
     <dd>The corresponding lines are in common.  That is, either the lines are
identical, or the difference is ignored because of one of the
<code>--ignore</code> options (see <a href="#White%20Space">White Space</a>).

     <br><dt><code>|</code>
     <dd>The corresponding lines differ, and they are either both complete
or both incomplete.

     <br><dt><code>&lt;</code>
     <dd>The files differ and only the first file contains the line.

     <br><dt><code>&gt;</code>
     <dd>The files differ and only the second file contains the line.

     <br><dt><code>(</code>
     <dd>Only the first file contains the line, but the difference is ignored.

     <br><dt><code>)</code>
     <dd>Only the second file contains the line, but the difference is ignored.

     <br><dt><code>\</code>
     <dd>The corresponding lines differ, and only the first line is incomplete.

     <br><dt><code>/</code>
     <dd>The corresponding lines differ, and only the second line is incomplete. 
</dl>

   <p>Normally, an output line is incomplete if and only if the lines that it
contains are incomplete; See <a href="#Incomplete%20Lines">Incomplete Lines</a>.  However, when an
output line represents two differing lines, one might be incomplete
while the other is not.  In this case, the output line is complete,
but its the gutter is marked <code>\</code> if the first line is incomplete,
<code>/</code> if the second line is.

   <p>Side by side format is sometimes easiest to read, but it has limitations. 
It generates much wider output than usual, and truncates lines that are
too long to fit.  Also, it relies on lining up output more heavily than
usual, so its output looks particularly bad if you use varying
width fonts, nonstandard tab stops, or nonprinting characters.

   <p>You can use the <code>sdiff</code> command to interactively merge side by side
differences.  See <a href="#Interactive%20Merging">Interactive Merging</a>, for more information on merging files.

<h3 class="subsection">2.3.1 Controlling Side by Side Format</h4>

<p>The <code>-y</code> or <code>--side-by-side</code> option selects side by side
format.  Because side by side output lines contain two input lines, the
output is wider than usual: normally 130 print columns, which can fit
onto a traditional printer line.  You can set the width of the output
with the <code>-W </code><var>columns</var><code></code> or <code>--width=</code><var>columns</var><code></code>
option.  The output is split into two halves of equal width, separated by a
small gutter to mark differences; the right half is aligned to a tab
stop so that tabs line up.  Input lines that are too long to fit in half
of an output line are truncated for output.

   <p>The <code>--left-column</code> option prints only the left column of two
common lines.  The <code>--suppress-common-lines</code> option suppresses
common lines entirely.

<p>The "normal" <code>diff</code> output format shows each hunk of differences
without any surrounding context.  Sometimes such output is the clearest
way to see how lines have changed, without the clutter of nearby
unchanged lines (although you can get similar results with the context
or unified formats by using 0 lines of context).  However, this format
is no longer widely used for sending out patches; for that purpose, the
context format (see <a href="#Context%20Format">Context Format</a>) and the unified format
(see <a href="#Unified%20Format">Unified Format</a>) are superior.  Normal format is the default for
compatibility with older versions of <code>diff</code> and the <small>POSIX</small>
standard.  Use the <code>--normal</code> option to select this output
format explicitly.

<h3 class="subsection">2.4.2 Detailed Description of Normal Format</h4>

<p>The normal output format consists of one or more hunks of differences;
each hunk shows one area where the files differ.  Normal format hunks
look like this:

<pre class="example">     <var>change-command</var>
     &lt; <var>from-file-line</var>
     &lt; <var>from-file-line</var>...
     ---
     &gt; <var>to-file-line</var>
     &gt; <var>to-file-line</var>...
     </pre>

   <p>There are three types of change commands.  Each consists of a line
number or comma-separated range of lines in the first file, a single
character indicating the kind of change to make, and a line number or
comma-separated range of lines in the second file.  All line numbers are
the original line numbers in each file.  The types of change commands
are:

     <dl>
<dt><code></code><var>l</var><code>a</code><var>r</var><code></code>
     <dd>Add the lines in range <var>r</var> of the second file after line <var>l</var> of
the first file.  For example, <code>8a12,15</code> means append lines 12-15
of file 2 after line 8 of file 1; or, if changing file 2 into file 1,
delete lines 12-15 of file 2.

     <br><dt><code></code><var>f</var><code>c</code><var>t</var><code></code>
     <dd>Replace the lines in range <var>f</var> of the first file with lines in range
<var>t</var> of the second file.  This is like a combined add and delete, but
more compact.  For example, <code>5,7c8,10</code> means change lines 5-7 of
file 1 to read as lines 8-10 of file 2; or, if changing file 2 into
file 1, change lines 8-10 of file 2 to read as lines 5-7 of file 1.

     <br><dt><code></code><var>r</var><code>d</code><var>l</var><code></code>
     <dd>Delete the lines in range <var>r</var> from the first file; line <var>l</var> is where
they would have appeared in the second file had they not been deleted. 
For example, <code>5,7d3</code> means delete lines 5-7 of file 1; or, if
changing file 2 into file 1, append lines 5-7 of file 1 after line 3 of
file 2.

automatically; today, with <code>patch</code>, it is almost obsolete.  Use the
<code>-e</code> or <code>--ed</code> option to select this output format.

   <p>Like the normal format (see <a href="#Normal">Normal</a>), this output format does not
show any context; unlike the normal format, it does not include the
information necessary to apply the diff in reverse (to produce the first
file if all you have is the second file and the diff).

   <p>If the file <code>d</code> contains the output of <code>diff -e old new</code>, then
the command <code>(cat d &amp;&amp; echo w) | ed - old</code> edits <code>old</code> to make
it a copy of <code>new</code>.  More generally, if <code>d1</code>, <code>d2</code>,
<small class="dots">...</small>, <code>dN</code> contain the outputs of <code>diff -e old new1</code>,
<code>diff -e new1 new2</code>, <small class="dots">...</small>, <code>diff -e newN-1 newN</code>,
respectively, then the command <code>(cat d1 d2 ... dN &amp;&amp; echo w) |
ed - old</code> edits <code>old</code> to make it a copy of <code>newN</code>.

<h3 class="subsubsection">2.5.1.2 Detailed Description of <code>ed</code> Format</h5>

<p>The <code>ed</code> output format consists of one or more hunks of
differences.  The changes closest to the ends of the files come first so
that commands that change the number of lines do not affect how
<code>ed</code> interprets line numbers in succeeding commands.  <code>ed</code>
format hunks look like this:

<pre class="example">     <var>change-command</var>
     <var>to-file-line</var>
     <var>to-file-line</var>...
     .
     </pre>

   <p>Because <code>ed</code> uses a single period on a line to indicate the
end of input, <small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> protects lines of changes
that contain a single period on a line by writing two periods instead,
then writing a subsequent <code>ed</code> command to change the two
periods into one.  The <code>ed</code> format cannot represent an
incomplete line, so if the second file ends in a changed incomplete
line, <code>diff</code> reports an error and then pretends that a newline
was appended.

   <p>There are three types of change commands.  Each consists of a line
number or comma-separated range of lines in the first file and a single
character indicating the kind of change to make.  All line numbers are
the original line numbers in the file.  The types of change commands
are:

     <dl>
<dt><code></code><var>l</var><code>a</code>
     <dd>Add text from the second file after line <var>l</var> in the first file.  For
example, <code>8a</code> means to add the following lines after line 8 of file
1.

     <br><dt><code></code><var>r</var><code>c</code>
     <dd>Replace the lines in range <var>r</var> in the first file with the following
lines.  Like a combined add and delete, but more compact.  For example,
<code>5,7c</code> means change lines 5-7 of file 1 to read as the text file
2.

     <br><dt><code></code><var>r</var><code>d</code>
     <dd>Delete the lines in range <var>r</var> from the first file.  For example,
<code>5,7d</code> means delete lines 5-7 of file 1.

<h3 class="subsection">2.5.2 Forward <code>ed</code> Scripts</h4>

<p><code>diff</code> can produce output that is like an <code>ed</code> script, but
with hunks in forward (front to back) order.  The format of the commands
is also changed slightly: command characters precede the lines they
modify, spaces separate line numbers in ranges, and no attempt is made
to disambiguate hunk lines consisting of a single period.  Like
<code>ed</code> format, forward <code>ed</code> format cannot represent incomplete
lines.

   <p>Forward <code>ed</code> format is not very useful, because neither <code>ed</code>
nor <code>patch</code> can apply diffs in this format.  It exists mainly for
compatibility with older versions of <code>diff</code>.  Use the <code>-f</code> or
<code>--forward-ed</code> option to select it.

<h3 class="subsection">2.5.3 <small>RCS</small> Scripts</h4>

<p>The <small>RCS</small> output format is designed specifically for use by
the Revision Control System, which is a set of free programs used for
organizing different versions and systems of files.  Use the
<code>-n</code> or <code>--rcs</code> option to select this output format.  It
is like the forward <code>ed</code> format (see <a href="#Forward%20ed">Forward ed</a>), but it
can represent arbitrary changes to the contents of a file because it
avoids the forward <code>ed</code> format's problems with lines
consisting of a single period and with incomplete lines.  Instead of
ending text sections with a line consisting of a single period, each
command specifies the number of lines it affects; a combination of the
<code>a</code> and <code>d</code> commands are used instead of <code>c</code>.  Also, if
the second file ends in a changed incomplete line, then the output
also ends in an incomplete line.

   <p>Here is the output of <code>diff -n lao tzu</code> (see <a href="#Sample%20diff%20Input">Sample diff Input</a>, for the complete contents of the two files):

<h3 class="section">2.6 Merging Files with If-then-else</h3>

<p>You can use <code>diff</code> to merge two files of C source code.  The output
of <code>diff</code> in this format contains all the lines of both files. 
Lines common to both files are output just once; the differing parts are
separated by the C preprocessor directives <code>#ifdef </code><var>name</var><code></code> or
<code>#ifndef </code><var>name</var><code></code>, <code>#else</code>, and <code>#endif</code>.  When
compiling the output, you select which version to use by either defining
or leaving undefined the macro <var>name</var>.

   <p>To merge two files, use <code>diff</code> with the <code>-D </code><var>name</var><code></code> or
<code>--ifdef=</code><var>name</var><code></code> option.  The argument <var>name</var> is the C
preprocessor identifier to use in the <code>#ifdef</code> and <code>#ifndef</code>
directives.

   <p>For example, if you change an instance of <code>wait (&amp;s)</code> to
<code>waitpid (-1, &amp;s, 0)</code> and then merge the old and new files with
the <code>--ifdef=HAVE_WAITPID</code> option, then the affected part of your code
might look like this:

<pre class="example">         do {
     #ifndef HAVE_WAITPID
             if ((w = wait (&amp;s)) &lt; 0  &amp;&amp;  errno != EINTR)
     #else /* HAVE_WAITPID */
             if ((w = waitpid (-1, &amp;s, 0)) &lt; 0  &amp;&amp;  errno != EINTR)
     #endif /* HAVE_WAITPID */
                 return w;
         } while (w != child);
     </pre>

   <p>You can specify formats for languages other than C by using line group
formats and line formats, as described in the next sections.

<h3 class="subsection">2.6.1 Line Group Formats</h4>

<p>Line group formats let you specify formats suitable for many
applications that allow if-then-else input, including programming
languages and text formatting languages.  A line group format specifies
the output format for a contiguous group of similar lines.

   <p>For example, the following command compares the TeX files <code>old</code>
and <code>new</code>, and outputs a merged file in which old regions are
surrounded by <code>\begin{em}</code>-<code>\end{em}</code> lines, and new
regions are surrounded by <code>\begin{bf}</code>-<code>\end{bf}</code> lines.

<pre class="example">     diff \
        --old-group-format='\begin{em}
     %&lt;\end{em}
     ' \
        --new-group-format='\begin{bf}
     %&gt;\end{bf}
     ' \
        old new
     </pre>

   <p>The following command is equivalent to the above example, but it is a
little more verbose, because it spells out the default line group formats.

<pre class="example">     diff \
        --old-group-format='\begin{em}
     %&lt;\end{em}
     ' \
        --new-group-format='\begin{bf}
     %&gt;\end{bf}
     ' \
        --unchanged-group-format='%=' \
        --changed-group-format='\begin{em}
     %&lt;\end{em}
     \begin{bf}
     %&gt;\end{bf}
     ' \
        old new
     </pre>

   <p>Here is a more advanced example, which outputs a diff listing with
headers containing line numbers in a "plain English" style.

<pre class="example">     diff \
        --unchanged-group-format='' \
        --old-group-format='-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s) deleted at %df:
     %&lt;' \
        --new-group-format='-------- %dN line%(N=1?:s) added after %de:
     %&gt;' \
        --changed-group-format='-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s) changed at %df:
     %&lt;-------- to:
     %&gt;' \
        old new
     </pre>

   <p>To specify a line group format, use <code>diff</code> with one of the options
listed below.  You can specify up to four line group formats, one for
each kind of line group.  You should quote <var>format</var>, because it
typically contains shell metacharacters.

     <dl>
<dt><code>--old-group-format=</code><var>format</var><code></code>
     <dd>These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the first file. 
The default old group format is the same as the changed group format if
it is specified; otherwise it is a format that outputs the line group as-is.

     <br><dt><code>--new-group-format=</code><var>format</var><code></code>
     <dd>These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the second
file.  The default new group format is same as the changed group
format if it is specified; otherwise it is a format that outputs the
line group as-is.

     <br><dt><code>--changed-group-format=</code><var>format</var><code></code>
     <dd>These line groups are hunks containing lines from both files.  The
default changed group format is the concatenation of the old and new
group formats.

     <br><dt><code>--unchanged-group-format=</code><var>format</var><code></code>
     <dd>These line groups contain lines common to both files.  The default
unchanged group format is a format that outputs the line group as-is. 
</dl>

   <p>In a line group format, ordinary characters represent themselves;
conversion specifications start with <code>%</code> and have one of the
following forms.

     <dl>
<dt><code>%&lt;</code>
     <dd>stands for the lines from the first file, including the trailing newline. 
Each line is formatted according to the old line format (see <a href="#Line%20Formats">Line Formats</a>).

     <br><dt><code>%&gt;</code>
     <dd>stands for the lines from the second file, including the trailing newline. 
Each line is formatted according to the new line format.

     <br><dt><code>%=</code>
     <dd>stands for the lines common to both files, including the trailing newline. 
Each line is formatted according to the unchanged line format.

     <br><dt><code>%%</code>
     <dd>stands for <code>%</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%c'</code><var>C</var><code>'</code>
     <dd>where <var>C</var> is a single character, stands for <var>C</var>. 
<var>C</var> may not be a backslash or an apostrophe. 
For example, <code>%c':'</code> stands for a colon, even inside
the then-part of an if-then-else format, which a colon would
normally terminate.

     <br><dt><code>%c'\</code><var>O</var><code>'</code>
     <dd>where <var>O</var> is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits,
stands for the character with octal code <var>O</var>. 
For example, <code>%c'\0'</code> stands for a null character.

     <br><dt><code></code><var>F</var><code></code><var>n</var><code></code>
     <dd>where <var>F</var> is a <code>printf</code> conversion specification and <var>n</var> is one
of the following letters, stands for <var>n</var>'s value formatted with <var>F</var>.

          <dl>
<dt><code>e</code>
          <dd>The line number of the line just before the group in the old file.

          <br><dt><code>f</code>
          <dd>The line number of the first line in the group in the old file;
equals <var>e</var> + 1.

          <br><dt><code>l</code>
          <dd>The line number of the last line in the group in the old file.

          <br><dt><code>m</code>
          <dd>The line number of the line just after the group in the old file;
equals <var>l</var> + 1.

          <br><dt><code>n</code>
          <dd>The number of lines in the group in the old file; equals <var>l</var> - <var>f</var> + 1.

          <br><dt><code>E, F, L, M, N</code>
          <dd>Likewise, for lines in the new file.

     </dl>

     <p>The <code>printf</code> conversion specification can be <code>%d</code>,
<code>%o</code>, <code>%x</code>, or <code>%X</code>, specifying decimal, octal,
lower case hexadecimal, or upper case hexadecimal output
respectively.  After the <code>%</code> the following options can appear in
sequence: a series of zero or more flags; an integer
specifying the minimum field width; and a period followed by an
optional integer specifying the minimum number of digits. 
The flags are <code>-</code> for left-justification, <code>'</code> for separating
the digit into groups as specified by the <code>LC_NUMERIC</code> locale category,
and <code>0</code> for padding with zeros instead of spaces. 
For example, <code>%5dN</code> prints the number of new lines in the group
in a field of width 5 characters, using the <code>printf</code> format <code>"%5d"</code>.

     <br><dt><code>(</code><var>A</var><code>=</code><var>B</var><code>?</code><var>T</var><code>:</code><var>E</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>If <var>A</var> equals <var>B</var> then <var>T</var> else <var>E</var>. 
<var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are each either a decimal constant
or a single letter interpreted as above. 
This format spec is equivalent to <var>T</var> if
<var>A</var>'s value equals <var>B</var>'s; otherwise it is equivalent to <var>E</var>.

     <p>For example, <code>%(N=0?no:%dN) line%(N=1?:s)</code> is equivalent to
<code>no lines</code> if <var>N</var> (the number of lines in the group in the
new file) is 0, to <code>1 line</code> if <var>N</var> is 1, and to <code>%dN lines</code>
otherwise.

<h3 class="subsection">2.6.2 Line Formats</h4>

<p>Line formats control how each line taken from an input file is
output as part of a line group in if-then-else format.

   <p>For example, the following command outputs text with a one-character
change indicator to the left of the text.  The first character of output
is <code>-</code> for deleted lines, <code>|</code> for added lines, and a space for
unchanged lines.  The formats contain newline characters where newlines
are desired on output.

<pre class="example">     diff \
        --old-line-format='-%l
     ' \
        --new-line-format='|%l
     ' \
        --unchanged-line-format=' %l
     ' \
        old new
     </pre>

   <p>To specify a line format, use one of the following options.  You should
quote <var>format</var>, since it often contains shell metacharacters.

     <dl>
<dt><code>--old-line-format=</code><var>format</var><code></code>
     <dd>formats lines just from the first file.

     <br><dt><code>--new-line-format=</code><var>format</var><code></code>
     <dd>formats lines just from the second file.

     <br><dt><code>--unchanged-line-format=</code><var>format</var><code></code>
     <dd>formats lines common to both files.

     <br><dt><code>--line-format=</code><var>format</var><code></code>
     <dd>formats all lines; in effect, it sets all three above options simultaneously. 
</dl>

   <p>In a line format, ordinary characters represent themselves;
conversion specifications start with <code>%</code> and have one of the
following forms.

     <dl>
<dt><code>%l</code>
     <dd>stands for the contents of the line, not counting its trailing
newline (if any).  This format ignores whether the line is incomplete;
See <a href="#Incomplete%20Lines">Incomplete Lines</a>.

     <br><dt><code>%L</code>
     <dd>stands for the contents of the line, including its trailing newline
(if any).  If a line is incomplete, this format preserves its
incompleteness.

     <br><dt><code>%%</code>
     <dd>stands for <code>%</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%c'</code><var>C</var><code>'</code>
     <dd>where <var>C</var> is a single character, stands for <var>C</var>. 
<var>C</var> may not be a backslash or an apostrophe. 
For example, <code>%c':'</code> stands for a colon.

     <br><dt><code>%c'\</code><var>O</var><code>'</code>
     <dd>where <var>O</var> is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits,
stands for the character with octal code <var>O</var>. 
For example, <code>%c'\0'</code> stands for a null character.

     <br><dt><code></code><var>F</var><code>n</code>
     <dd>where <var>F</var> is a <code>printf</code> conversion specification,
stands for the line number formatted with <var>F</var>. 
For example, <code>%.5dn</code> prints the line number using the
<code>printf</code> format <code>"%.5d"</code>.  See <a href="#Line%20Group%20Formats">Line Group Formats</a>, for
more about printf conversion specifications.

   </dl>

   <p>The default line format is <code>%l</code> followed by a newline character.

   <p>If the input contains tab characters and it is important that they line
up on output, you should ensure that <code>%l</code> or <code>%L</code> in a line
format is just after a tab stop (e.g. by preceding <code>%l</code> or
<code>%L</code> with a tab character), or you should use the <code>-t</code> or
<code>--expand-tabs</code> option.

   <p>Taken together, the line and line group formats let you specify many
different formats.  For example, the following command uses a format
similar to normal <code>diff</code> format.  You can tailor this command
to get fine control over <code>diff</code> output.

<pre class="example">     diff \
        --old-line-format='&lt; %l
     ' \
        --new-line-format='&gt; %l

<h3 class="subsection">2.6.4 Detailed Description of If-then-else Format</h4>

<p>For lines common to both files, <code>diff</code> uses the unchanged line
group format.  For each hunk of differences in the merged output
format, if the hunk contains only lines from the first file,
<code>diff</code> uses the old line group format; if the hunk contains only
lines from the second file, <code>diff</code> uses the new group format;
otherwise, <code>diff</code> uses the changed group format.

   <p>The old, new, and unchanged line formats specify the output format of
lines from the first file, lines from the second file, and lines common
to both files, respectively.

   <p>The option <code>--ifdef=</code><var>name</var><code></code> is equivalent to
the following sequence of options using shell syntax:

<pre class="example">     --old-group-format='#ifndef <var>name</var>
     %&lt;#endif /* ! <var>name</var> */
     ' \
     --new-group-format='#ifdef <var>name</var>
     %&gt;#endif /* <var>name</var> */
     ' \
     --unchanged-group-format='%=' \
     --changed-group-format='#ifndef <var>name</var>
     %&lt;#else /* <var>name</var> */
     %&gt;#endif /* <var>name</var> */
     '
     </pre>

   <p>You should carefully check the <code>diff</code> output for proper nesting. 
For example, when using the <code>-D </code><var>name</var><code></code> or
<code>--ifdef=</code><var>name</var><code></code> option, you should check that if the
differing lines contain any of the C preprocessor directives
<code>#ifdef</code>, <code>#ifndef</code>, <code>#else</code>, <code>#elif</code>, or
<code>#endif</code>, they are nested properly and match.  If they don't, you
must make corrections manually.  It is a good idea to carefully check
the resulting code anyway to make sure that it really does what you
want it to; depending on how the input files were produced, the output
might contain duplicate or otherwise incorrect code.

   <p>The <code>patch</code> <code>-D </code><var>name</var><code></code> option behaves like
the <code>diff</code> <code>-D </code><var>name</var><code></code> option, except it operates on
a file and a diff to produce a merged file; See <a href="#patch%20Options">patch Options</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Incomplete Lines</h2>

<p>When an input file ends in a non-newline character, its last line is
called an <dfn>incomplete line</dfn> because its last character is not a
newline.  All other lines are called <dfn>full lines</dfn> and end in a
newline character.  Incomplete lines do not match full lines unless
differences in white space are ignored (see <a href="#White%20Space">White Space</a>).

   <p>An incomplete line is normally distinguished on output from a full
line by a following line that starts with <code>\</code>.  However, the
<small>RCS</small> format (see <a href="#RCS">RCS</a>) outputs the incomplete line as-is,
without any trailing newline or following line.  The side by side
format normally represents incomplete lines as-is, but in some cases
uses a <code>\</code> or <code>/</code> gutter marker; See <a href="#Side%20by%20Side">Side by Side</a>.  The
if-then-else line format preserves a line's incompleteness with
<code>%L</code>, and discards the newline with <code>%l</code>; See <a href="#Line%20Formats">Line Formats</a>.  Finally, with the <code>ed</code> and forward <code>ed</code>
output formats (see <a href="#Output%20Formats">Output Formats</a>) <code>diff</code> cannot
represent an incomplete line, so it pretends there was a newline and
reports an error.

   <p>For example, suppose <code>F</code> and <code>G</code> are one-byte files that
contain just <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, respectively.  Then <code>diff F G</code>
outputs

<pre class="example">     1c1
     &lt; f
     \ No newline at end of file
     ---
     &gt; g
     \ No newline at end of file
     </pre>

<p>(The exact message may differ in non-English locales.) 
<code>diff -n F G</code> outputs the following without a trailing newline:

<pre class="example">     d1 1
     a1 1
     g
     </pre>

<p><code>diff -e F G</code> reports two errors and outputs the following:

<pre class="example">     1c
     g
     .
     </pre>

<h2 class="chapter">4 Comparing Directories</h2>

<p>You can use <code>diff</code> to compare some or all of the files in two
directory trees.  When both file name arguments to <code>diff</code> are
directories, it compares each file that is contained in both
directories, examining file names in alphabetical order as specified by
the <code>LC_COLLATE</code> locale category.  Normally
<code>diff</code> is silent about pairs of files that contain no differences,
but if you use the <code>-s</code> or <code>--report-identical-files</code> option,
it reports pairs of identical files.  Normally <code>diff</code> reports
subdirectories common to both directories without comparing
subdirectories' files, but if you use the <code>-r</code> or
<code>--recursive</code> option, it compares every corresponding pair of files
in the directory trees, as many levels deep as they go.

   <p>For file names that are in only one of the directories, <code>diff</code>
normally does not show the contents of the file that exists; it reports
only that the file exists in that directory and not in the other.  You
can make <code>diff</code> act as though the file existed but was empty in the
other directory, so that it outputs the entire contents of the file that
actually exists.  (It is output as either an insertion or a
deletion, depending on whether it is in the first or the second
directory given.)  To do this, use the <code>-N</code> or <code>--new-file</code>
option.

   <p>If the older directory contains one or more large files that are not in
the newer directory, you can make the patch smaller by using the
<code>--unidirectional-new-file</code> option instead of <code>-N</code>. 
This option is like <code>-N</code> except that it only inserts the contents
of files that appear in the second directory but not the first (that is,
files that were added).  At the top of the patch, write instructions for
the user applying the patch to remove the files that were deleted before
applying the patch.  See <a href="#Making%20Patches">Making Patches</a>, for more discussion of
making patches for distribution.

   <p>To ignore some files while comparing directories, use the <code>-x
</code><var>pattern</var><code></code> or <code>--exclude=</code><var>pattern</var><code></code> option.  This option
ignores any files or subdirectories whose base names match the shell
pattern <var>pattern</var>.  Unlike in the shell, a period at the start of
the base of a file name matches a wildcard at the start of a pattern. 
You should enclose <var>pattern</var> in quotes so that the shell does not
expand it.  For example, the option <code>-x '*.[ao]'</code> ignores any file
whose name ends with <code>.a</code> or <code>.o</code>.

   <p>This option accumulates if you specify it more than once.  For example,
using the options <code>-x 'RCS' -x '*,v'</code> ignores any file or
subdirectory whose base name is <code>RCS</code> or ends with <code>,v</code>.

   <p>If you need to give this option many times, you can instead put the
patterns in a file, one pattern per line, and use the <code>-X
</code><var>file</var><code></code> or <code>--exclude-from=</code><var>file</var><code></code> option.  Trailing
white space and empty lines are ignored in the pattern file.

   <p>If you have been comparing two directories and stopped partway through,
later you might want to continue where you left off.  You can do this by
using the <code>-S </code><var>file</var><code></code> or <code>--starting-file=</code><var>file</var><code></code>
option.  This compares only the file <var>file</var> and all alphabetically
later files in the topmost directory level.

   <p>If two directories differ only in that file names are lower case in
one directory and upper case in the upper, <code>diff</code> normally
reports many differences because it compares file names in a
case sensitive way.  With the <code>--ignore-file-name-case</code> option,
<code>diff</code> ignores case differences in file names, so that for example
the contents of the file <code>Tao</code> in one directory are compared to
the contents of the file <code>TAO</code> in the other.  The
<code>--no-ignore-file-name-case</code> option cancels the effect of the
<code>--ignore-file-name-case</code> option, reverting to the default
behavior.

   <p>If an <code>-x </code><var>pattern</var><code></code> or <code>--exclude=</code><var>pattern</var><code></code>
option, or an <code>-X </code><var>file</var><code></code> or
<code>--exclude-from=</code><var>file</var><code></code> option,
is specified while the <code>--ignore-file-name-case</code> option is in
effect, case is ignored when excluding file names matching the
specified patterns.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Making <code>diff</code> Output Prettier</h2>

<p><code>diff</code> provides several ways to adjust the appearance of its output. 
These adjustments can be applied to any output format.

</div>

<h3 class="section">5.1 Preserving Tab Stop Alignment</h3>

<p>The lines of text in some of the <code>diff</code> output formats are
preceded by one or two characters that indicate whether the text is
inserted, deleted, or changed.  The addition of those characters can
cause tabs to move to the next tab stop, throwing off the alignment of
columns in the line.  <small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> provides two ways
to make tab-aligned columns line up correctly.

   <p>The first way is to have <code>diff</code> convert all tabs into the correct
number of spaces before outputting them; select this method with the
<code>-t</code> or <code>--expand-tabs</code> option.  To use this form of output with
<code>patch</code>, you must give <code>patch</code> the <code>-l</code> or
<code>--ignore-white-space</code> option (see <a href="#Changed%20White%20Space">Changed White Space</a>, for more
information).  <code>diff</code> normally assumes that tab stops are set
every 8 print columns, but this can be altered by the
<code>--tabsize=</code><var>columns</var><code></code> option.

   <p>The other method for making tabs line up correctly is to add a tab
character instead of a space after the indicator character at the
beginning of the line.  This ensures that all following tab characters
are in the same position relative to tab stops that they were in the
original files, so that the output is aligned correctly.  Its
disadvantage is that it can make long lines too long to fit on one line
of the screen or the paper.  It also does not work with the unified
output format, which does not have a space character after the change
type indicator character.  Select this method with the <code>-T</code> or
<code>--initial-tab</code> option.

<h3 class="section">5.2 Paginating <code>diff</code> Output</h3>

<p>It can be convenient to have long output page-numbered and time-stamped. 
The <code>-l</code> or <code>--paginate</code> option does this by sending the
<code>diff</code> output through the <code>pr</code> program.  Here is what the page
header might look like for <code>diff -lc lao tzu</code>:

<pre class="example">     2002-02-22 14:20                 diff -lc lao tzu                 Page 1

<h2 class="chapter">6 <code>diff</code> Performance Tradeoffs</h2>

<p><small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> runs quite efficiently; however, in some
circumstances you can cause it to run faster or produce a more compact
set of changes.

   <p>One way to improve <code>diff</code> performance is to use hard or
symbolic links to files instead of copies.  This improves performance
because <code>diff</code> normally does not need to read two hard or
symbolic links to the same file, since their contents must be
identical.  For example, suppose you copy a large directory hierarchy,
make a few changes to the copy, and then often use <code>diff -r</code> to
compare the original to the copy.  If the original files are
read-only, you can greatly improve performance by creating the copy
using hard or symbolic links (e.g., with <small>GNU</small> <code>cp -lR</code> or
<code>cp -sR</code>).  Before editing a file in the copy for the first time,
you should break the link and replace it with a regular copy.

   <p>You can also affect the performance of <small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> by
giving it options that change the way it compares files. 
Performance has more than one dimension.  These options improve one
aspect of performance at the cost of another, or they improve
performance in some cases while hurting it in others.

   <p>The way that <small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> determines which lines have
changed always comes up with a near-minimal set of differences. 
Usually it is good enough for practical purposes.  If the
<code>diff</code> output is large, you might want <code>diff</code> to use a
modified algorithm that sometimes produces a smaller set of
differences.  The <code>-d</code> or <code>--minimal</code> option does this;
however, it can also cause <code>diff</code> to run more slowly than
usual, so it is not the default behavior.

   <p>When the files you are comparing are large and have small groups of
changes scattered throughout them, you can use the
<code>--speed-large-files</code> option to make a different modification to
the algorithm that <code>diff</code> uses.  If the input files have a constant
small density of changes, this option speeds up the comparisons without
changing the output.  If not, <code>diff</code> might produce a larger set of
differences; however, the output will still be correct.

   <p>Normally <code>diff</code> discards the prefix and suffix that is common to
both files before it attempts to find a minimal set of differences. 
This makes <code>diff</code> run faster, but occasionally it may produce
non-minimal output.  The <code>--horizon-lines=</code><var>lines</var><code></code> option
prevents <code>diff</code> from discarding the last <var>lines</var> lines of the
prefix and the first <var>lines</var> lines of the suffix.  This gives
<code>diff</code> further opportunities to find a minimal output.

   <p>Suppose a run of changed lines includes a sequence of lines at one end
and there is an identical sequence of lines just outside the other end. 
The <code>diff</code> command is free to choose which identical sequence is
included in the hunk.  In this case, <code>diff</code> normally shifts the
hunk's boundaries when this merges adjacent hunks, or shifts a hunk's
lines towards the end of the file.  Merging hunks can make the output
look nicer in some cases.

<h3 class="section">7.3 Detailed Description of <code>diff3</code> Normal Format</h3>

<p>Each hunk begins with a line marked <code>====</code>.  Three-way hunks have
plain <code>====</code> lines, and two-way hunks have <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or
<code>3</code> appended to specify which of the three input files differ in
that hunk.  The hunks contain copies of two or three sets of input
lines each preceded by one or two commands identifying where the lines
came from.

   <p>Normally, two spaces precede each copy of an input line to distinguish
it from the commands.  But with the <code>-T</code> or <code>--initial-tab</code>
option, <code>diff3</code> uses a tab instead of two spaces; this lines up
tabs correctly.  See <a href="#Tabs">Tabs</a>, for more information.

   <p>Commands take the following forms:

     <dl>
<dt><code></code><var>file</var><code>:</code><var>l</var><code>a</code>
     <dd>This hunk appears after line <var>l</var> of file <var>file</var>, and
contains no lines in that file.  To edit this file to yield the other
files, one must append hunk lines taken from the other files.  For
example, <code>1:11a</code> means that the hunk follows line 11 in the first
file and contains no lines from that file.

     <br><dt><code></code><var>file</var><code>:</code><var>r</var><code>c</code>
     <dd>This hunk contains the lines in the range <var>r</var> of file <var>file</var>. 
The range <var>r</var> is a comma-separated pair of line numbers, or just one
number if the range is a singleton.  To edit this file to yield the
other files, one must change the specified lines to be the lines taken
from the other files.  For example, <code>2:11,13c</code> means that the hunk
contains lines 11 through 13 from the second file. 
</dl>

   <p>If the last line in a set of input lines is incomplete
(see <a href="#Incomplete%20Lines">Incomplete Lines</a>), it is distinguished on output from a full
line by a following line that starts with <code>\</code>.

<h3 class="section">7.4 <code>diff3</code> Hunks</h3>

<p>Groups of lines that differ in two or three of the input files are
called <dfn>diff3 hunks</dfn>, by analogy with <code>diff</code> hunks
(see <a href="#Hunks">Hunks</a>).  If all three input files differ in a <code>diff3</code>
hunk, the hunk is called a <dfn>three-way hunk</dfn>; if just two input files
differ, it is a <dfn>two-way hunk</dfn>.

   <p>As with <code>diff</code>, several solutions are possible.  When comparing the
files <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>, <code>diff3</code> normally finds
<code>diff3</code> hunks by merging the two-way hunks output by the two
commands <code>diff A B</code> and <code>diff A C</code>.  This does not necessarily
minimize the size of the output, but exceptions should be rare.

   <p>For example, suppose <code>F</code> contains the three lines <code>a</code>,
<code>b</code>, <code>f</code>, <code>G</code> contains the lines <code>g</code>, <code>b</code>,
<code>g</code>, and <code>H</code> contains the lines <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>,
<code>h</code>.  <code>diff3 F G H</code> might output the following:

<pre class="example">     ====2
     1:1c
     3:1c
       a
     2:1c
       g

       f
     2:3c
       g
     3:3c
       h
     </pre>

<p>because it found a two-way hunk containing <code>a</code> in the first and
third files and <code>g</code> in the second file, then the single line
<code>b</code> common to all three files, then a three-way hunk containing
the last line of each file.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Merging From a Common Ancestor</h2>

<p>When two people have made changes to copies of the same file,
<code>diff3</code> can produce a merged output that contains both sets of
changes together with warnings about conflicts.

   <p>One might imagine programs with names like <code>diff4</code> and <code>diff5</code>
to compare more than three files simultaneously, but in practice the
need rarely arises.  You can use <code>diff3</code> to merge three or more
sets of changes to a file by merging two change sets at a time.

   <p><code>diff3</code> can incorporate changes from two modified versions into a
common preceding version.  This lets you merge the sets of changes
represented by the two newer files.  Specify the common ancestor version
as the second argument and the two newer versions as the first and third
arguments, like this:

<pre class="example">     diff3 <var>mine</var> <var>older</var> <var>yours</var>
     </pre>

<p>You can remember the order of the arguments by noting that they are in
alphabetical order.

   <p>You can think of this as subtracting <var>older</var> from <var>yours</var> and
adding the result to <var>mine</var>, or as merging into <var>mine</var> the
changes that would turn <var>older</var> into <var>yours</var>.  This merging is
well-defined as long as <var>mine</var> and <var>older</var> match in the
neighborhood of each such change.  This fails to be true when all three
input files differ or when only <var>older</var> differs; we call this
a <dfn>conflict</dfn>.  When all three input files differ, we call the
conflict an <dfn>overlap</dfn>.

   <p><code>diff3</code> gives you several ways to handle overlaps and conflicts. 
You can omit overlaps or conflicts, or select only overlaps,
or mark conflicts with special <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> lines.

   <p><code>diff3</code> can output the merge results as an <code>ed</code> script that
that can be applied to the first file to yield the merged output. 
However, it is usually better to have <code>diff3</code> generate the merged
output directly; this bypasses some problems with <code>ed</code>.

<h3 class="section">8.1 Selecting Which Changes to Incorporate</h3>

<p>You can select all unmerged changes from <var>older</var> to <var>yours</var> for merging
into <var>mine</var> with the <code>-e</code> or <code>--ed</code> option.  You can
select only the nonoverlapping unmerged changes with <code>-3</code> or
<code>--easy-only</code>, and you can select only the overlapping changes with
<code>-x</code> or <code>--overlap-only</code>.

   <p>The <code>-e</code>, <code>-3</code> and <code>-x</code> options select only
<dfn>unmerged changes</dfn>, i.e. changes where <var>mine</var> and <var>yours</var>
differ; they ignore changes from <var>older</var> to <var>yours</var> where
<var>mine</var> and <var>yours</var> are identical, because they assume that such
changes have already been merged.  If this assumption is not a safe
one, you can use the <code>-A</code> or <code>--show-all</code> option
(see <a href="#Marking%20Conflicts">Marking Conflicts</a>).

   <p>Here is the output of the command <code>diff3</code> with each of these three
options (see <a href="#Sample%20diff3%20Input">Sample diff3 Input</a>, for the complete contents of the files). 
Notice that <code>-e</code> outputs the union of the disjoint sets of changes
output by <code>-3</code> and <code>-x</code>.

   <p>Output of <code>diff3 -e lao tzu tao</code>:
<pre class="example">     11a

<h3 class="section">8.2 Marking Conflicts</h3>

<p><code>diff3</code> can mark conflicts in the merged output by
bracketing them with special marker lines.  A conflict
that comes from two files <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> is marked as follows:

<pre class="example">     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <var>A</var>
     lines from <var>A</var>
     =======
     lines from <var>B</var>
     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <var>B</var>
     </pre>

   <p>A conflict that comes from three files <var>A</var>, <var>B</var> and <var>C</var> is
marked as follows:

<pre class="example">     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <var>A</var>
     lines from <var>A</var>
     ||||||| <var>B</var>
     lines from <var>B</var>
     =======
     lines from <var>C</var>
     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <var>C</var>
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>-A</code> or <code>--show-all</code> option acts like the <code>-e</code>
option, except that it brackets conflicts, and it outputs all changes
from <var>older</var> to <var>yours</var>, not just the unmerged changes.  Thus,
given the sample input files (see <a href="#Sample%20diff3%20Input">Sample diff3 Input</a>), <code>diff3
-A lao tzu tao</code> puts brackets around the conflict where only <code>tzu</code>
differs:

<pre class="example">     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; tzu
     =======
     The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
     The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tao
     </pre>

   <p>And it outputs the three-way conflict as follows:

<pre class="example">     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; lao
     ||||||| tzu
     They both may be called deep and profound.
     Deeper and more profound,
     The door of all subtleties!
     =======
     
       -- The Way of Lao-Tzu, tr. Wing-tsit Chan
     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tao
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>-E</code> or <code>--show-overlap</code> option outputs less information
than the <code>-A</code> or <code>--show-all</code> option, because it outputs only
unmerged changes, and it never outputs the contents of the second
file.  Thus the <code>-E</code> option acts like the <code>-e</code> option,
except that it brackets the first and third files from three-way
overlapping changes.  Similarly, <code>-X</code> acts like <code>-x</code>, except
it brackets all its (necessarily overlapping) changes.  For example,
for the three-way overlapping change above, the <code>-E</code> and <code>-X</code>
options output the following:

<pre class="example">     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; lao
     =======
     
       -- The Way of Lao-Tzu, tr. Wing-tsit Chan
     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tao
     </pre>

   <p>If you are comparing files that have meaningless or uninformative names,
you can use the <code>--label=</code><var>label</var><code></code>
option to show alternate names in the <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>|||||||</code>
and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> brackets.  This option can be given up to three
times, once for each input file.  Thus <code>diff3 -A --label X
--label Y --label Z A
B C</code> acts like <code>diff3 -A A B C</code>, except that the output looks like
it came from files named <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code> rather than
from files named <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>.

<h3 class="section">8.3 Generating the Merged Output Directly</h3>

<p>With the <code>-m</code> or <code>--merge</code> option, <code>diff3</code> outputs the
merged file directly.  This is more efficient than using <code>ed</code> to
generate it, and works even with non-text files that <code>ed</code> would
reject.  If you specify <code>-m</code> without an <code>ed</code> script option,
<code>-A</code> is assumed.

   <p>For example, the command <code>diff3 -m lao tzu tao</code>
(see <a href="#Sample%20diff3%20Input">Sample diff3 Input</a> for a copy of the input files) would output
the following:

<pre class="example">     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; tzu
     =======
     The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
     The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tao
     The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
     The Named is the mother of all things.
     Therefore let there always be non-being,
       so we may see their subtlety,
     And let there always be being,
       so we may see their result.
     The two are the same,
     But after they are produced,
       they have different names.
     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; lao
     ||||||| tzu
     They both may be called deep and profound.

<h3 class="section">8.4 How <code>diff3</code> Merges Incomplete Lines</h3>

<p>With <code>-m</code>, incomplete lines (see <a href="#Incomplete%20Lines">Incomplete Lines</a>) are simply
copied to the output as they are found; if the merged output ends in an
conflict and one of the input files ends in an incomplete
line, succeeding <code>|||||||</code>, <code>=======</code> or <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
brackets appear somewhere other than the start of a line because
they are appended to the incomplete line.

   <p>Without <code>-m</code>, if an <code>ed</code> script option is specified and an
incomplete line is found, <code>diff3</code> generates a warning and acts as
if a newline had been present.

<h3 class="section">8.5 Saving the Changed File</h3>

System V <code>diff3</code> generates these extra commands.  <small>GNU</small>
<code>diff3</code> normally behaves like traditional Unix
<code>diff3</code>, but with the <code>-i</code> option it behaves like
System V <code>diff3</code> and appends the <code>w</code> and <code>q</code>
commands.

   <p>The <code>-i</code> option requires one of the <code>ed</code> script options
<code>-AeExX3</code>, and is incompatible with the merged output option
<code>-m</code>.

<code>-o </code><var>file</var><code></code> or <code>--output=</code><var>file</var><code></code> to specify where to
put the merged text.  See <a href="#Invoking%20sdiff">Invoking sdiff</a>, for more details on the

<h3 class="section">9.1 Specifying <code>diff</code> Options to <code>sdiff</code></h3>

<p>The following <code>sdiff</code> options have the same meaning as for
<code>diff</code>.  See <a href="#diff%20Options">diff Options</a>, for the use of these options.

<pre class="example">     -a -b -d -i -t -v
     -B -E -I <var>regexp</var>
     
     --expand-tabs
     --ignore-blank-lines  --ignore-case
     --ignore-matching-lines=<var>regexp</var>  --ignore-space-change
     --ignore-tab-expansion
     --left-column  --minimal  --speed-large-files
     --strip-trailing-cr  --suppress-common-lines
     --tabsize=<var>columns</var>  --text  --version  --width=<var>columns</var>
     </pre>

   <p>For historical reasons, <code>sdiff</code> has alternate names for some
options.  The <code>-l</code> option is equivalent to the
<code>--left-column</code> option, and similarly <code>-s</code> is equivalent
to <code>--suppress-common-lines</code>.  The meaning of the <code>sdiff</code>
<code>-w</code> and <code>-W</code> options is interchanged from that of
<code>diff</code>: with <code>sdiff</code>, <code>-w </code><var>columns</var><code></code> is
equivalent to <code>--width=</code><var>columns</var><code></code>, and <code>-W</code> is
equivalent to <code>--ignore-all-space</code>.  <code>sdiff</code> without the
<code>-o</code> option is equivalent to <code>diff</code> with the <code>-y</code>
or <code>--side-by-side</code> option (see <a href="#Side%20by%20Side">Side by Side</a>).

<h3 class="section">9.2 Merge Commands</h3>

<p>Groups of common lines, with a blank gutter, are copied from the first

commands.  Follow each command with &lt;RET&gt;.

     <dl>
<dt><code>e</code>
     <dd>Discard both versions. 
Invoke a text editor on an empty temporary file,
then copy the resulting file to the output.

<h2 class="chapter">10 Merging with <code>patch</code></h2>

<p><code>patch</code> takes comparison output produced by <code>diff</code> and applies
the differences to a copy of the original file, producing a patched
version.  With <code>patch</code>, you can distribute just the changes to a
set of files instead of distributing the entire file set; your
correspondents can apply <code>patch</code> to update their copy of the files
with your changes.  <code>patch</code> automatically determines the diff
format, skips any leading or trailing headers, and uses the headers to
determine which file to patch.  This lets your correspondents feed a
mail message containing a difference listing directly to
<code>patch</code>.

   <p><code>patch</code> detects and warns about common problems like forward
patches.  It saves any patches that it could not apply.  It can also maintain a
<code>patchlevel.h</code> file to ensure that your correspondents apply
diffs in the proper order.

   <p><code>patch</code> accepts a series of diffs in its standard input, usually
separated by headers that specify which file to patch.  It applies
<code>diff</code> hunks (see <a href="#Hunks">Hunks</a>) one by one.  If a hunk does not
exactly match the original file, <code>patch</code> uses heuristics to try to
patch the file as well as it can.  If no approximate match can be found,
<code>patch</code> rejects the hunk and skips to the next hunk.  <code>patch</code>
normally replaces each file <var>f</var> with its new version, putting reject
hunks (if any) into <code></code><var>f</var><code>.rej</code>.

following options to force <code>patch</code> to interpret the patch file as a
certain format of diff.  The output formats listed here are the only
ones that <code>patch</code> can understand.

<h3 class="section">10.2 Revision Control</h3>

<p>If a nonexistent input file is under a revision control system
supported by <code>patch</code>, <code>patch</code> normally asks the user
whether to get (or check out) the file from the revision control
system.  Patch currently supports <small>RCS</small>, ClearCase and
<small>SCCS</small>.  Under <small>RCS</small> and <small>SCCS</small>,
<code>patch</code> also asks when the input file is read-only and matches
the default version in the revision control system.

   <p>The <code>-g </code><var>num</var><code></code> or <code>--get=</code><var>num</var><code></code> option affects access
to files under supported revision control systems.  If <var>num</var> is
positive, <code>patch</code> gets the file without asking the user; if
zero, <code>patch</code> neither asks the user nor gets the file; and if
negative, <code>patch</code> asks the user before getting the file.  The
default value of <var>num</var> is given by the value of the
<code>PATCH_GET</code> environment variable if it is set; if not, the default
value is zero if <code>patch</code> is conforming to <small>POSIX</small>, negative
otherwise.  See <a href="#patch%20and%20POSIX">patch and POSIX</a>.

   <p>The choice of revision control system is unaffected by the
<code>VERSION_CONTROL</code> environment variable (see <a href="#Backup%20Names">Backup Names</a>).

<h3 class="section">10.3 Applying Imperfect Patches</h3>

<p><code>patch</code> tries to skip any leading text in the patch file,
apply the diff, and then skip any trailing text.  Thus you can feed a
mail message directly to <code>patch</code>, and it should work.  If the
entire diff is indented by a constant amount of white space,
<code>patch</code> automatically ignores the indentation.  If a context
diff contains trailing carriage return on each line, <code>patch</code>
automatically ignores the carriage return.  If a context diff has been

<h3 class="subsection">10.3.1 Applying Patches with Changed White Space</h4>

<p>Sometimes mailers, editors, or other programs change spaces into tabs,
or vice versa.  If this happens to a patch file or an input file, the
files might look the same, but <code>patch</code> will not be able to match
them properly.  If this problem occurs, use the <code>-l</code> or
<code>--ignore-white-space</code> option, which makes <code>patch</code> compare
blank characters (i.e. spaces and tabs) loosely so that any nonempty
sequence of blanks in the patch file matches any nonempty sequence of
blanks in the input files.  Non-blank
characters must still match exactly.  Each line of the context must
still match a line in the input file.

<h3 class="subsection">10.3.2 Applying Reversed Patches</h4>

<p>Sometimes people run <code>diff</code> with the new file first instead of
second.  This creates a diff that is "reversed".  To apply such
patches, give <code>patch</code> the <code>-R</code> or <code>--reverse</code> option. 
<code>patch</code> then attempts to swap each hunk around before applying it. 
Rejects come out in the swapped format.

   <p>Often <code>patch</code> can guess that the patch is reversed.  If the first
hunk of a patch fails, <code>patch</code> reverses the hunk to see if it can
apply it that way.  If it can, <code>patch</code> asks you if you want to have
the <code>-R</code> option set; if it can't, <code>patch</code> continues to apply
the patch normally.  This method cannot detect a reversed patch if it is
a normal diff and the first command is an append (which should have been
a delete) since appends always succeed, because a null context matches
anywhere.  But most patches add or change lines rather than delete them,
so most reversed normal diffs begin with a delete, which fails, and
<code>patch</code> notices.

   <p>If you apply a patch that you have already applied, <code>patch</code> thinks
it is a reversed patch and offers to un-apply the patch.  This could be
construed as a feature.  If you did this inadvertently and you don't
want to un-apply the patch, just answer <code>n</code> to this offer and to
the subsequent "apply anyway" question--or type <kbd>C-c</kbd> to kill the
<code>patch</code> process.

<h3 class="subsection">10.3.3 Helping <code>patch</code> Find Inexact Matches</h4>

<p>For context diffs, and to a lesser extent normal diffs, <code>patch</code> can
detect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect, and
it attempts to find the correct place to apply each hunk of the patch. 
As a first guess, it takes the line number mentioned in the hunk, plus
or minus any offset used in applying the previous hunk.  If that is not
the correct place, <code>patch</code> scans both forward and backward for a
set of lines matching the context given in the hunk.

   <p>First <code>patch</code> looks for a place where all lines of the context
match.  If it cannot find such a place, and it is reading a context or
unified diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or more, then
<code>patch</code> makes another scan, ignoring the first and last line of
context.  If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 2 or
more, it makes another scan, ignoring the first two and last two lines
of context are ignored.  It continues similarly if the maximum fuzz
factor is larger.

   <p>The <code>-F </code><var>lines</var><code></code> or <code>--fuzz=</code><var>lines</var><code></code> option sets the
maximum fuzz factor to <var>lines</var>.  This option only applies to context
and unified diffs; it ignores up to <var>lines</var> lines while looking for
the place to install a hunk.  Note that a larger fuzz factor increases
the odds of making a faulty patch.  The default fuzz factor is 2; there
is no point to setting it to more than the number of lines of context
in the diff, ordinarily 3.

   <p>If <code>patch</code> cannot find a place to install a hunk of the patch, it
writes the hunk out to a reject file (see <a href="#Reject%20Names">Reject Names</a>, for information
on how reject files are named).  It writes out rejected hunks in context
format no matter what form the input patch is in.  If the input is a
normal or <code>ed</code> diff, many of the contexts are simply null.  The
line numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be different from those
in the patch file: they show the approximate location where <code>patch</code>
thinks the failed hunks belong in the new file rather than in the old
one.

   <p>If the <code>--verbose</code> option is given, then
as it completes each hunk <code>patch</code> tells you whether the hunk
succeeded or failed, and if it failed, on which line (in the new file)
<code>patch</code> thinks the hunk should go.  If this is different from the
line number specified in the diff, it tells you the offset.  A single
large offset <em>may</em> indicate that <code>patch</code> installed a hunk in
the wrong place.  <code>patch</code> also tells you if it used a fuzz factor
to make the match, in which case you should also be slightly suspicious.

   <p><code>patch</code> cannot tell if the line numbers are off in an <code>ed</code>
script, and can only detect wrong line numbers in a normal diff when it
finds a change or delete command.  It may have the same problem with a
context diff using a fuzz factor equal to or greater than the number of
lines of context shown in the diff (typically 3).  In these cases, you
should probably look at a context diff between your original and patched
input files to see if the changes make sense.  Compiling without errors
is a pretty good indication that the patch worked, but not a guarantee.

   <p>A patch against an empty file applies to a nonexistent file, and vice
versa.  See <a href="#Creating%20and%20Removing">Creating and Removing</a>.

   <p><code>patch</code> usually produces the correct results, even when it must
make many guesses.  However, the results are guaranteed only when
the patch is applied to an exact copy of the file that the patch was
generated from.

<h3 class="subsection">10.3.4 Predicting what <code>patch</code> will do</h4>

<p>It may not be obvious in advance what <code>patch</code> will do with a
complicated or poorly formatted patch.  If you are concerned that the
input might cause <code>patch</code> to modify the wrong files, you can
use the <code>--dry-run</code> option, which causes <code>patch</code> to
print the results of applying patches without actually changing any
files.  You can then inspect the diagnostics generated by the dry run
to see whether <code>patch</code> will modify the files that you expect. 
If the patch does not do what you want, you can modify the patch (or
the other options to <code>patch</code>) and try another dry run.  Once
you are satisfied with the proposed patch you can apply it by invoking
<code>patch</code> as before, but this time without the
<code>--dry-run</code> option.

<h3 class="section">10.4 Creating and Removing Files</h3>

<p>Sometimes when comparing two directories, a file may exist in one
directory but not the other.  If you give <code>diff</code> the
<code>-N</code> or <code>--new-file</code> option, or if you supply an old or
new file that is named <code>/dev/null</code> or is empty and is dated the
Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), <code>diff</code> outputs a patch that
adds or deletes the contents of this file.  When given such a patch,
<code>patch</code> normally creates a new file or removes the old file. 
However, when conforming to <small>POSIX</small> (see <a href="#patch%20and%20POSIX">patch and POSIX</a>),
<code>patch</code> does not remove the old file, but leaves it empty. 
The <code>-E</code> or <code>--remove-empty-files</code> option causes
<code>patch</code> to remove output files that are empty after applying a
patch, even if the patch does not appear to be one that removed the
file.

   <p>If the patch appears to create a file that already exists,
<code>patch</code> asks for confirmation before applying the patch.

<h3 class="section">10.5 Updating Time Stamps on Patched Files</h3>

<p>When <code>patch</code> updates a file, it normally sets the file's
last-modified time stamp to the current time of day.  If you are using
<code>patch</code> to track a software distribution, this can cause
<code>make</code> to incorrectly conclude that a patched file is out of
date.  For example, if <code>syntax.c</code> depends on <code>syntax.y</code>, and
<code>patch</code> updates <code>syntax.c</code> and then <code>syntax.y</code>, then
<code>syntax.c</code> will normally appear to be out of date with respect to
<code>syntax.y</code> even though its contents are actually up to date.

   <p>The <code>-Z</code> or <code>--set-utc</code> option causes <code>patch</code> to
set a patched file's modification and access times to the time stamps
given in context diff headers.  If the context diff headers do not
specify a time zone, they are assumed to use Coordinated Universal
Time (<small>UTC</small>, often known as <small>GMT</small>).

   <p>The <code>-T</code> or <code>--set-time</code> option acts like <code>-Z</code> or
<code>--set-utc</code>, except that it assumes that the context diff
headers' time stamps use local time instead of <small>UTC</small>.  This option
is not recommended, because patches using local time cannot easily be
used by people in other time zones, and because local time stamps are
ambiguous when local clocks move backwards during daylight-saving time
adjustments.  If the context diff headers specify a time zone, this
option is equivalent to <code>-Z</code> or <code>--set-utc</code>.

   <p><code>patch</code> normally refrains from setting a file's time stamps if
the file's original last-modified time stamp does not match the time
given in the diff header, of if the file's contents do not exactly
match the patch.  However, if the <code>-f</code> or <code>--force</code>
option is given, the file's time stamps are set regardless.

   <p>Due to the limitations of the current <code>diff</code> format,
<code>patch</code> cannot update the times of files whose contents have
not changed.  Also, if you set file time stamps to values other than
the current time of day, you should also remove (e.g., with <code>make
clean</code>) all files that depend on the patched files, so that later
invocations of <code>make</code> do not get confused by the patched
files' times.

<h3 class="section">10.6 Multiple Patches in a File</h3>

<p>If the patch file contains more than one patch, and if you do not
specify an input file on the command line, <code>patch</code> tries to
apply each patch as if they came from separate patch files.  This
means that it determines the name of the file to patch for each patch,
and that it examines the leading text before each patch for file names
and prerequisite revision level (see <a href="#Making%20Patches">Making Patches</a>, for more on
that topic).

   <p><code>patch</code> uses the following rules to intuit a file name from
the leading text before a patch.  First, <code>patch</code> takes an
ordered list of candidate file names as follows:

     <ul>
<li>If the header is that of a context diff, <code>patch</code> takes the old
and new file names in the header.  A name is ignored if it does not
have enough slashes to satisfy the <code>-p</code><var>num</var><code></code> or
<code>--strip=</code><var>num</var><code></code> option.  The name <code>/dev/null</code> is also
ignored.

     <li>If there is an <code>Index:</code> line in the leading garbage and if either
the old and new names are both absent or if <code>patch</code> is
conforming to <small>POSIX</small>, <code>patch</code> takes the name in the
<code>Index:</code> line.

     <li>For the purpose of the following rules, the candidate file names are
considered to be in the order (old, new, index), regardless of the
order that they appear in the header. 
</ul>

<p>Then <code>patch</code> selects a file name from the candidate list as
follows:

     <ul>
<li>If some of the named files exist, <code>patch</code> selects the first
name if conforming to <small>POSIX</small>, and the best name otherwise.

     <li>If <code>patch</code> is not ignoring <small>RCS</small>, ClearCase, and <small>SCCS</small>
(see <a href="#Revision%20Control">Revision Control</a>), and no named files exist but an <small>RCS</small>,
ClearCase, or <small>SCCS</small> master is found, <code>patch</code> selects the
first named file with an <small>RCS</small>, ClearCase, or <small>SCCS</small> master.

     <li>If no named files exist, no <small>RCS</small>, ClearCase, or <small>SCCS</small> master
was found, some names are given, <code>patch</code> is not conforming to
<small>POSIX</small>, and the patch appears to create a file, <code>patch</code>
selects the best name requiring the creation of the fewest
directories.

     <li>If no file name results from the above heuristics, you are asked for
the name of the file to patch, and <code>patch</code> selects that name. 
</ul>

   <p>To determine the <dfn>best</dfn> of a nonempty list of file names,
<code>patch</code> first takes all the names with the fewest path name
components; of those, it then takes all the names with the shortest
basename; of those, it then takes all the shortest names; finally, it
takes the first remaining name.

   <p>See <a href="#patch%20and%20POSIX">patch and POSIX</a>, to see whether <code>patch</code> is conforming
to <small>POSIX</small>.

<h3 class="section">10.7 Applying Patches in Other Directories</h3>

<p>The <code>-d </code><var>directory</var><code></code> or <code>--directory=</code><var>directory</var><code></code>
option to <code>patch</code> makes directory <var>directory</var> the current
directory for interpreting both file names in the patch file, and file
names given as arguments to other options (such as <code>-B</code> and
<code>-o</code>).  For example, while in a mail reading program, you can patch
a file in the <code>/usr/src/emacs</code> directory directly from a message
containing the patch like this:

<pre class="example">     | patch -d /usr/src/emacs
     </pre>

   <p>Sometimes the file names given in a patch contain leading directories,
but you keep your files in a directory different from the one given in
the patch.  In those cases, you can use the
<code>-p</code><var>number</var><code></code> or <code>--strip=</code><var>number</var><code></code>
option to set the file name strip count to <var>number</var>.  The strip
count tells <code>patch</code> how many slashes, along with the directory
names between them, to strip from the front of file names.  A sequence
of one or more adjacent slashes is counted as a single slash.  By
default, <code>patch</code> strips off all leading directories, leaving
just the base file names.

   <p>For example, suppose the file name in the patch file is
<code>/gnu/src/emacs/etc/NEWS</code>.  Using <code>-p0</code> gives the
entire file name unmodified, <code>-p1</code> gives
<code>gnu/src/emacs/etc/NEWS</code> (no leading slash), <code>-p4</code> gives
<code>etc/NEWS</code>, and not specifying <code>-p</code> at all gives <code>NEWS</code>.

   <p><code>patch</code> looks for each file (after any slashes have been stripped)
in the current directory, or if you used the <code>-d </code><var>directory</var><code></code>
option, in that directory.

<h3 class="section">10.8 Backup Files</h3>

<p>Normally, <code>patch</code> creates a backup file if the patch does not
exactly match the original input file, because in that case the
original data might not be recovered if you undo the patch with
<code>patch -R</code> (see <a href="#Reversed%20Patches">Reversed Patches</a>).  However, when conforming
to <small>POSIX</small>, <code>patch</code> does not create backup files by
default.  See <a href="#patch%20and%20POSIX">patch and POSIX</a>.

   <p>The <code>-b</code> or <code>--backup</code> option causes <code>patch</code> to
make a backup file regardless of whether the patch matches the
original input.  The <code>--backup-if-mismatch</code> option causes
<code>patch</code> to create backup files for mismatches files; this is
the default when not conforming to <small>POSIX</small>.  The
<code>--no-backup-if-mismatch</code> option causes <code>patch</code> to not
create backup files, even for mismatched patches; this is the default
when conforming to <small>POSIX</small>.

   <p>When backing up a file that does not exist, an empty, unreadable
backup file is created as a placeholder to represent the nonexistent
file.

<h3 class="section">10.9 Backup File Names</h3>

<p>Normally, <code>patch</code> renames an original input file into a backup
file by appending to its name the extension <code>.orig</code>, or <code>~</code>
if using <code>.orig</code> would make the backup file name too
long.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  The <code>-z </code><var>backup-suffix</var><code></code> or
<code>--suffix=</code><var>backup-suffix</var><code></code> option causes <code>patch</code> to
use <var>backup-suffix</var> as the backup extension instead.

   <p>Alternately, you can specify the extension for backup files with the
<code>SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX</code> environment variable, which the options
override.

   <p><code>patch</code> can also create numbered backup files the way
<small>GNU</small> Emacs does.  With this method, instead of having a
single backup of each file, <code>patch</code> makes a new backup file
name each time it patches a file.  For example, the backups of a file
named <code>sink</code> would be called, successively, <code>sink.~1~</code>,
<code>sink.~2~</code>, <code>sink.~3~</code>, etc.

   <p>The <code>-V </code><var>backup-style</var><code></code> or
<code>--version-control=</code><var>backup-style</var><code></code> option takes as an
argument a method for creating backup file names.  You can alternately
control the type of backups that <code>patch</code> makes with the
<code>PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL</code> environment variable, which the
<code>-V</code> option overrides.  If <code>PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL</code> is not
set, the <code>VERSION_CONTROL</code> environment variable is used instead. 
Please note that these options and variables control backup file
names; they do not affect the choice of revision control system
(see <a href="#Revision%20Control">Revision Control</a>).

   <p>The values of these environment variables and the argument to the
<code>-V</code> option are like the <small>GNU</small> Emacs <code>version-control</code>
variable (see <a href="emacs.html#Backup%20Names">Backup Names</a>,
for more information on backup versions in Emacs).  They also
recognize synonyms that are more descriptive.  The valid values are
listed below; unique abbreviations are acceptable.

     <dl>
<dt><code>t</code>
     <dd><dt><code>numbered</code>
     <dd>Always make numbered backups.

     <br><dt><code>nil</code>
     <dd><dt><code>existing</code>
     <dd>Make numbered backups of files that already have them, simple backups of
the others.  This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>never</code>
     <dd><dt><code>simple</code>
     <dd>Always make simple backups. 
</dl>

   <p>You can also tell <code>patch</code> to prepend a prefix, such as a
directory name, to produce backup file names.  The <code>-B
</code><var>prefix</var><code></code> or <code>--prefix=</code><var>prefix</var><code></code> option makes backup
files by prepending <var>prefix</var> to them.  The <code>-Y
</code><var>prefix</var><code></code> or <code>--basename-prefix=</code><var>prefix</var><code></code> prepends
<var>prefix</var> to the last file name component of backup file names
instead; for example, <code>-Y ~</code> causes the backup name for
<code>dir/file.c</code> to be <code>dir/~file.c</code>.  If you use either of
these prefix options, the suffix-based options are ignored.

   <p>If you specify the output file with the <code>-o</code> option, that file is
the one that is backed up, not the input file.

   <p>Options that affect the names of backup files do not affect whether
backups are made.  For example, if you specify the
<code>--no-backup-if-mismatch</code> option, none of the options described
in this section have any affect, because no backups are made.

<p><code>patch</code> can produce a variety of messages, especially if it
has trouble decoding its input.  In a few situations where it's not
sure how to proceed, <code>patch</code> normally prompts you for more
information from the keyboard.  There are options to produce more or
fewer messages, to have it not ask for keyboard input, and to
affect the way that file names are quoted in messages.

<h3 class="subsection">10.11.1 Controlling the Verbosity of <code>patch</code></h4>

<p>You can cause <code>patch</code> to produce more messages by using the

the message <code>Hmm...</code> indicates that <code>patch</code> is reading text in
the patch file, attempting to determine whether there is a patch in that
text, and if so, what kind of patch it is.

   <p>You can inhibit all terminal output from <code>patch</code>, unless an error
occurs, by using the <code>-s</code>, <code>--quiet</code>, or <code>--silent</code>
option.

<p>There are two ways you can prevent <code>patch</code> from asking you any
questions.  The <code>-f</code> or <code>--force</code> option assumes that you know
what you are doing.  It causes <code>patch</code> to do the following:

     <ul>
<li>Skip patches that do not contain file names in their headers.

     <li>Patch files even though they have the wrong version for the
<code>Prereq:</code> line in the patch;

     <li>Assume that patches are not reversed even if they look like they are. 
</ul>

<p>The <code>-t</code> or <code>--batch</code> option is similar to <code>-f</code>, in that
it suppresses questions, but it makes somewhat different assumptions:

     <ul>
<li>Skip patches that do not contain file names in their headers
(the same as <code>-f</code>).

     <li>Skip patches for which the file has the wrong version for the
<code>Prereq:</code> line in the patch;

     <li>Assume that patches are reversed if they look like they are.

<h3 class="subsection">10.11.3 <code>patch</code> Quoting Style</h4>

<p>When <code>patch</code> outputs a file name in a diagnostic message, it
can format the name in any of several ways.  This can be useful to
output file names unambiguously, even if they contain punctuation or
special characters like newlines.  The
<code>--quoting-style=</code><var>word</var><code></code> option controls how names are
output.  The <var>word</var> should be one of the following:

     <dl>
<dt><code>literal</code>
     <dd>Output names as-is. 
<br><dt><code>shell</code>
     <dd>Quote names for the shell if they contain shell metacharacters or would
cause ambiguous output. 
<br><dt><code>shell-always</code>
     <dd>Quote names for the shell, even if they would normally not require quoting. 
<br><dt><code>c</code>
     <dd>Quote names as for a C language string. 
<br><dt><code>escape</code>
     <dd>Quote as with <code>c</code> except omit the surrounding double-quote
characters. 
</dl>

   <p>You can specify the default value of the <code>--quoting-style</code>
option with the environment variable <code>QUOTING_STYLE</code>.  If that
environment variable is not set, the default value is <code>shell</code>,
but this default may change in a future version of <code>patch</code>.

<h3 class="section">10.13 <small>GNU</small> <code>patch</code> and Traditional <code>patch</code></h3>

<p>The current version of <small>GNU</small> <code>patch</code> normally follows the
<small>POSIX</small> standard.  See <a href="#patch%20and%20POSIX">patch and POSIX</a>, for the few exceptions
to this general rule.

   <p>Unfortunately, <small>POSIX</small> redefined the behavior of <code>patch</code> in
several important ways.  You should be aware of the following
differences if you must interoperate with traditional <code>patch</code>,
or with <small>GNU</small> <code>patch</code> version 2.1 and earlier.

     <ul>
<li>In traditional <code>patch</code>, the <code>-p</code> option's operand was
optional, and a bare <code>-p</code> was equivalent to <code>-p0</code>.  The
<code>-p</code> option now requires an operand, and <code>-p 0</code> is now
equivalent to <code>-p0</code>.  For maximum compatibility, use options
like <code>-p0</code> and <code>-p1</code>.

     <p>Also, traditional <code>patch</code> simply counted slashes when
stripping path prefixes; <code>patch</code> now counts pathname
components.  That is, a sequence of one or more adjacent slashes now
counts as a single slash.  For maximum portability, avoid sending
patches containing <code>//</code> in file names.

     </p><li>In traditional <code>patch</code>, backups were enabled by default.  This
behavior is now enabled with the <code>-b</code> or <code>--backup</code>
option.

     <p>Conversely, in <small>POSIX</small> <code>patch</code>, backups are never made,
even when there is a mismatch.  In <small>GNU</small> <code>patch</code>, this
behavior is enabled with the <code>--no-backup-if-mismatch</code> option,
or by conforming to <small>POSIX</small>.

     <p>The <code>-b </code><var>suffix</var><code></code> option of traditional <code>patch</code> is
equivalent to the <code>-b -z </code><var>suffix</var><code></code> options of <small>GNU</small>
<code>patch</code>.

     </p><li>Traditional <code>patch</code> used a complicated (and incompletely
documented) method to intuit the name of the file to be patched from
the patch header.  This method did not conform to <small>POSIX</small>, and had
a few gotchas.  Now <code>patch</code> uses a different, equally
complicated (but better documented) method that is optionally
<small>POSIX</small>-conforming; we hope it has fewer gotchas.  The two methods
are compatible if the file names in the context diff header and the
<code>Index:</code> line are all identical after prefix-stripping.  Your
patch is normally compatible if each header's file names all contain
the same number of slashes.

     <li>When traditional <code>patch</code> asked the user a question, it sent
the question to standard error and looked for an answer from the first
file in the following list that was a terminal: standard error,
standard output, <code>/dev/tty</code>, and standard input.  Now
<code>patch</code> sends questions to standard output and gets answers
from <code>/dev/tty</code>.  Defaults for some answers have been changed so
that <code>patch</code> never goes into an infinite loop when using
default answers.

     <li>Traditional <code>patch</code> exited with a status value that counted
the number of bad hunks, or with status 1 if there was real trouble. 
Now <code>patch</code> exits with status 1 if some hunks failed, or with
2 if there was real trouble.

     <li>Limit yourself to the following options when sending instructions
meant to be executed by anyone running <small>GNU</small> <code>patch</code>,
traditional <code>patch</code>, or a <code>patch</code> that conforms to
<small>POSIX</small>.  Spaces are significant in the following list, and
operands are required.

     <pre class="example">          <code>-c</code>
          <code>-d </code><var>dir</var><code></code>
          <code>-D </code><var>define</var><code></code>
          <code>-e</code>
          <code>-l</code>
          <code>-n</code>
          <code>-N</code>
          <code>-o </code><var>outfile</var><code></code>
          <code>-p</code><var>num</var><code></code>
          <code>-R</code>

<p>Use some common sense when making and using patches.  For example,
when sending bug fixes to a program's maintainer, send several small
patches, one per independent subject, instead of one large,
harder-to-digest patch that covers all the subjects.

<h3 class="section">11.1 Tips for Patch Producers</h3>

<p>To create a patch that changes an older version of a package into a
newer version, first make a copy of the older and newer versions in
adjacent subdirectories.  It is common to do that by unpacking
<code>tar</code> archives of the two versions.

   <p>To generate the patch, use the command <code>diff -Naur </code><var>old</var><code>
</code><var>new</var><code></code> where <var>old</var> and <var>new</var> identify the old and new
directories.  The names <var>old</var> and <var>new</var> should not contain any
slashes.  The <code>-N</code> option lets the patch create and remove
files; <code>-a</code> lets the patch update non-text files; <code>-u</code>
generates useful time stamps and enough context; and <code>-r</code> lets
the patch update subdirectories.  Here is an example command, using
Bourne shell syntax:

<pre class="example">     diff -Naur gcc-3.0.3 gcc-3.0.4
     </pre>

   <p>Tell your recipients how to apply the patches.  This should include
which working directory to use, and which <code>patch</code> options to
use; the option <code>-p1</code> is recommended.  Test your procedure by
pretending to be a recipient and applying your patches to a copy of
the original files.

   <p>See <a href="#Avoiding%20Common%20Mistakes">Avoiding Common Mistakes</a>, for how to avoid common mistakes when
generating a patch.

<h3 class="section">11.2 Tips for Patch Consumers</h3>

<p>A patch producer should tell recipients how to apply the patches, so
the first rule of thumb for a patch consumer is to follow the
instructions supplied with the patch.

   <p><small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> can analyze files with arbitrarily long lines
and files that end in incomplete lines.  However, older versions of
<code>patch</code> cannot patch such files.  If you are having trouble
applying such patches, try upgrading to a recent version of <small>GNU</small>
<code>patch</code>.

<div class="node">

<br>

<h3 class="section">11.3 Avoiding Common Mistakes</h3>

<p>When producing a patch for multiple files, apply <code>diff</code> to
directories whose names do not have slashes.  This reduces confusion
when the patch consumer specifies the <code>-p</code><var>number</var><code></code> option,
since this option can have surprising results when the old and new
file names have different numbers of slashes.  For example, do not
send a patch with a header that looks like this:

<pre class="example">     diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README prog/README
     --- v2.0.29/prog/README	2002-03-10 23:30:39.942229878 -0800
     +++ prog/README	2002-03-17 20:49:32.442260588 -0800
     </pre>

<p>because the two file names have different numbers of slashes, and
different versions of <code>patch</code> interpret the file names
differently.  To avoid confusion, send output that looks like this
instead:

<pre class="example">     diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README v2.0.30/prog/README
     --- v2.0.29/prog/README	2002-03-10 23:30:39.942229878 -0800
     +++ v2.0.30/prog/README	2002-03-17 20:49:32.442260588 -0800
     </pre>

   <p>Make sure you have specified the file names correctly, either in a
context diff header or with an <code>Index:</code> line.  Take care to not send out
reversed patches, since these make people wonder whether they have
already applied the patch.

   <p>Avoid sending patches that compare backup file names like
<code>README.orig</code> or <code>README~</code>, since this might confuse
<code>patch</code> into patching a backup file instead of the real file. 
Instead, send patches that compare the same base file names in
different directories, e.g. <code>old/README</code> and <code>new/README</code>.

   <p>To save people from partially applying a patch before other patches that
should have gone before it, you can make the first patch in the patch
file update a file with a name like <code>patchlevel.h</code> or
<code>version.c</code>, which contains a patch level or version number.  If
the input file contains the wrong version number, <code>patch</code> will
complain immediately.

   <p>An even clearer way to prevent this problem is to put a <code>Prereq:</code>
line before the patch.  If the leading text in the patch file contains a
line that starts with <code>Prereq:</code>, <code>patch</code> takes the next word
from that line (normally a version number) and checks whether the next
input file contains that word, preceded and followed by either
white space or a newline.  If not, <code>patch</code> prompts you for
confirmation before proceeding.  This makes it difficult to accidentally
apply patches in the wrong order.

<h3 class="section">11.4 Generating Smaller Patches</h3>

<p>The simplest way to generate a patch is to use <code>diff -Naur</code>
(see <a href="#Tips%20for%20Patch%20Producers">Tips for Patch Producers</a>), but you might be able to reduce
the size of the patch by renaming or removing some files before making
the patch.  If the older version of the package contains any files
that the newer version does not, or if any files have been renamed
between the two versions, make a list of <code>rm</code> and <code>mv</code>
commands for the user to execute in the old version directory before
applying the patch.  Then run those commands yourself in the scratch
directory.

   <p>If there are any files that you don't need to include in the patch
because they can easily be rebuilt from other files (for example,
<code>TAGS</code> and output from <code>yacc</code> and <code>makeinfo</code>),
exclude them from the patch by giving <code>diff</code> the <code>-x
</code><var>pattern</var><code></code> option (see <a href="#Comparing%20Directories">Comparing Directories</a>).  If you want
your patch to modify a derived file because your recipients lack tools
to build it, make sure that the patch for the derived file follows any
patches for files that it depends on, so that the recipients' time
stamps will not confuse <code>make</code>.

   <p>Now you can create the patch using <code>diff -Naur</code>.  Make sure to
specify the scratch directory first and the newer directory second.

   <p>Add to the top of the patch a note telling the user any <code>rm</code> and
<code>mv</code> commands to run before applying the patch.  Then you can
remove the scratch directory.

   <p>You can also shrink the patch size by using fewer lines of context,
but bear in mind that <code>patch</code> typically needs at least two
lines for proper operation when patches do not exactly match the input
files.

<h2 class="chapter">12 Invoking <code>cmp</code></h2>

<p>The <code>cmp</code> command compares two files, and if they differ,
tells the first byte and line number where they differ or reports
that one file is a prefix of the other.  Bytes and
lines are numbered starting with 1.  The arguments of <code>cmp</code>
are as follows:

<pre class="example">     cmp <var>options</var>... <var>from-file</var> [<var>to-file</var> [<var>from-skip</var> [<var>to-skip</var>]]]
     </pre>

   <p>The file name <code>-</code> is always the standard input.  <code>cmp</code>
also uses the standard input if one file name is omitted.  The
<var>from-skip</var> and <var>to-skip</var> operands specify how many bytes to
ignore at the start of each file; they are equivalent to the
<code>--ignore-initial=</code><var>from-skip</var><code>:</code><var>to-skip</var><code></code> option.

   <p>By default, <code>cmp</code> outputs nothing if the two files have the
same contents.  If one file is a prefix of the other, <code>cmp</code>
prints to standard error a message of the following form:

<pre class="example">     cmp: EOF on <var>shorter-file</var>
     </pre>

   <p>Otherwise, <code>cmp</code> prints to standard output a message of the
following form:

<pre class="example">     <var>from-file</var> <var>to-file</var> differ: char <var>byte-number</var>, line <var>line-number</var>
     </pre>

   <p>The message formats can differ outside the <small>POSIX</small> locale. 
Also, <small>POSIX</small> allows the <small>EOF</small> message to be followed
by a blank and some additional information.

   <p>An exit status of 0 means no differences were found, 1 means some
differences were found, and 2 means trouble.

<h3 class="section">12.1 Options to <code>cmp</code></h3>

<p>Below is a summary of all of the options that <small>GNU</small>
<code>cmp</code> accepts.  Most options have two equivalent names, one of
which is a single letter preceded by <code>-</code>, and the other of which
is a long name preceded by <code>--</code>.  Multiple single letter options
(unless they take an argument) can be combined into a single command
line word: <code>-bl</code> is equivalent to <code>-b -l</code>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-b</code>
     <dd><dt><code>--print-bytes</code>
     <dd>Print the differing bytes.  Display control bytes as a
<code>^</code> followed by a letter of the alphabet and precede bytes
that have the high bit set with <code>M-</code> (which stands for "meta").

     <br><dt><code>--help</code>
     <dd>Output a summary of usage and then exit.

     <br><dt><code>-i </code><var>skip</var><code></code>
     <dd><dt><code>--ignore-initial=</code><var>skip</var><code></code>
     <dd>Ignore any differences in the first <var>skip</var> bytes of the input
files.  Treat files with fewer than <var>skip</var> bytes as if they are
empty.  If <var>skip</var> is of the form
<code></code><var>from-skip</var><code>:</code><var>to-skip</var><code></code>, skip the first <var>from-skip</var>
bytes of the first input file and the first <var>to-skip</var> bytes of the
second.

     <br><dt><code>-l</code>
     <dd><dt><code>--verbose</code>
     <dd>Output the (decimal) byte numbers and (octal) values of all differing bytes,
instead of the default standard output.

     <br><dt><code>-n </code><var>count</var><code></code>
     <dd><dt><code>--bytes=</code><var>count</var><code></code>
     <dd>Compare at most <var>count</var> input bytes.

     <br><dt><code>-s</code>
     <dd><dt><code>--quiet</code>
     <dd><dt><code>--silent</code>
     <dd>Do not print anything; only return an exit status indicating whether
the files differ.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code>
     <dd><dt><code>--version</code>
     <dd>Output version information and then exit. 
</dl>

   <p>In the above table, operands that are byte counts are normally
decimal, but may be preceded by <code>0</code> for octal and <code>0x</code> for
hexadecimal.

   <p>A byte count can be followed by a suffix to specify a multiple of that
count; in this case an omitted integer is understood to be 1.  A bare
size letter, or one followed by <code>iB</code>, specifies a multiple using
powers of 1024.  A size letter followed by <code>B</code> specifies powers
of 1000 instead.  For example, <code>-n 4M</code> and <code>-n 4MiB</code> are
equivalent to <code>-n 4194304</code>, whereas <code>-n 4MB</code> is
equivalent to <code>-n 4000000</code>.  This notation is upward compatible
with the <a href="http://www.bipm.fr/enus/3_SI/si-prefixes.html">SI prefixes</a> for decimal multiples and with the
<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html">IEC 60027-2 prefixes for binary multiples</a>.

   <p>The following suffixes are defined.  Large sizes like <code>1Y</code> may be

<h2 class="chapter">13 Invoking <code>diff</code></h2>

<p>The format for running the <code>diff</code> command is:

<pre class="example">     diff <var>options</var>... <var>files</var>...
     </pre>

   <p>In the simplest case, two file names <var>from-file</var> and
<var>to-file</var> are given, and <code>diff</code> compares the contents of
<var>from-file</var> and <var>to-file</var>.  A file name of <code>-</code> stands for
text read from the standard input.  As a special case, <code>diff - -</code>
compares a copy of standard input to itself.

   <p>If one file is a directory and the other is not, <code>diff</code> compares
the file in the directory whose name is that of the non-directory. 
The non-directory file must not be <code>-</code>.

   <p>If two file names are given and both are directories,
<code>diff</code> compares corresponding files in both directories, in
alphabetical order; this comparison is not recursive unless the
<code>-r</code> or <code>--recursive</code> option is given.  <code>diff</code> never
compares the actual contents of a directory as if it were a file.  The
file that is fully specified may not be standard input, because standard
input is nameless and the notion of "file with the same name" does not
apply.

   <p>If the <code>--from-file=</code><var>file</var><code></code> option is given, the number of
file names is arbitrary, and <var>file</var> is compared to each named file. 
Similarly, if the <code>--to-file=</code><var>file</var><code></code> option is given, each
named file is compared to <var>file</var>.

   <p><code>diff</code> options begin with <code>-</code>, so normally file names
may not begin with <code>-</code>.  However, <code>--</code> as an
argument by itself treats the remaining arguments as file names even if
they begin with <code>-</code>.

   <p>An exit status of 0 means no differences were found, 1 means some
differences were found, and 2 means trouble.  Normally, differing
binary files count as trouble, but this can be altered by using the
<code>-a</code> or <code>--text</code> option, or the <code>-q</code> or
<code>--brief</code> option.

<h3 class="section">13.1 Options to <code>diff</code></h3>

<p>Below is a summary of all of the options that <small>GNU</small>
<code>diff</code> accepts.  Most options have two equivalent names, one
of which is a single letter preceded by <code>-</code>, and the other of
which is a long name preceded by <code>--</code>.  Multiple single letter
options (unless they take an argument) can be combined into a single
command line word: <code>-ac</code> is equivalent to <code>-a -c</code>.  Long
named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name. 
Brackets ([ and ]) indicate that an option takes an optional argument.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-a</code>
     <dd><dt><code>--text</code>
     <dd>Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they
do not seem to be text.  See <a href="#Binary">Binary</a>.

     <dd><dt><code>--ignore-space-change</code>
     <dd>Ignore changes in amount of white space.  See <a href="#White%20Space">White Space</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-B</code>
     <dd><dt><code>--ignore-blank-lines</code>

See <a href="#Context%20Format">Context Format</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-C </code><var>lines</var><code></code>

For proper operation, <code>patch</code> typically needs at least two lines of
context.

     <p>On older systems, <code>diff</code> supports an obsolete option
<code>-</code><var>lines</var><code></code> that has effect when combined with <code>-c</code>
or <code>-p</code>.  <small>POSIX</small> 1003.1-2001 (see <a href="#Standards%20conformance">Standards conformance</a>) does not allow this; use <code>-C </code><var>lines</var><code></code>
instead.

     <dd><dt><code>--ignore-case</code>
     <dd>Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case letters
equivalent.  See <a href="#Case%20Folding">Case Folding</a>.

times, one for each input file.  The default labels are the names of
the input files.  Thus <code>diff3 --label X --label Y --label Z -m A
B C</code> acts like
<code>diff3 -m A B C</code>, except that the output looks like it came from
files named <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code> rather than from files
named <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>.  See <a href="#Marking%20Conflicts">Marking Conflicts</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-m</code>
     <dd><dt><code>--merge</code>
     <dd>Apply the edit script to the first file and send the result to standard
output.  Unlike piping the output from <code>diff3</code> to <code>ed</code>, this
works even for binary files and incomplete lines.  <code>-A</code> is assumed
if no edit script option is specified.  See <a href="#Bypassing%20ed">Bypassing ed</a>.

<pre class="example">     patch <var>options</var>... [<var>origfile</var> [<var>patchfile</var>]]
     </pre>

   <p>You can also specify where to read the patch from with the <code>-i
</code><var>patchfile</var><code></code> or <code>--input=</code><var>patchfile</var><code></code> option. 
If you do not specify <var>patchfile</var>, or if <var>patchfile</var> is
<code>-</code>, <code>patch</code> reads the patch (that is, the <code>diff</code> output)
from the standard input.

   <p>If you do not specify an input file on the command line, <code>patch</code>
tries to intuit from the <dfn>leading text</dfn> (any text in the patch
that comes before the <code>diff</code> output) which file to edit. 
See <a href="#Multiple%20Patches">Multiple Patches</a>.

   <p>By default, <code>patch</code> replaces the original input file with the
patched version, possibly after renaming the original file into a
backup file (see <a href="#Backup%20Names">Backup Names</a>, for a description of how
<code>patch</code> names backup files).  You can also specify where to
put the output with the <code>-o </code><var>file</var><code></code> or
<code>--output=</code><var>file</var><code></code> option; however, do not use this option
if <var>file</var> is one of the input files.

<h2 class="chapter">16 Invoking <code>sdiff</code></h2>

<p>The <code>sdiff</code> command merges two files and interactively outputs the
results.  Its arguments are as follows:

<pre class="example">     sdiff -o <var>outfile</var> <var>options</var>... <var>from-file</var> <var>to-file</var>
     </pre>

   <p>This merges <var>from-file</var> with <var>to-file</var>, with output to <var>outfile</var>. 
If <var>from-file</var> is a directory and <var>to-file</var> is not, <code>sdiff</code>
compares the file in <var>from-file</var> whose file name is that of <var>to-file</var>,
and vice versa.  <var>from-file</var> and <var>to-file</var> may not both be
directories.

   <p><code>sdiff</code> options begin with <code>-</code>, so normally <var>from-file</var>
and <var>to-file</var> may not begin with <code>-</code>.  However, <code>--</code> as an
argument by itself treats the remaining arguments as file names even if
they begin with <code>-</code>.  You may not use <code>-</code> as an input file.

   <p><code>sdiff</code> without <code>-o</code> (or <code>--output</code>) produces a
side-by-side difference.  This usage is obsolete; use the <code>-y</code>
or <code>--side-by-side</code> option of <code>diff</code> instead.

   <p>An exit status of 0 means no differences were found, 1 means some
differences were found, and 2 means trouble.

<h2 class="chapter">17 Standards conformance</h2>

<p>In a few cases, the <small>GNU</small> utilities' default behavior is
incompatible with the <small>POSIX</small> standard.  To suppress these
incompatibilities, define the <code>POSIXLY_CORRECT</code> environment
variable.  Unless you are checking for <small>POSIX</small> conformance, you
probably do not need to define <code>POSIXLY_CORRECT</code>.

   <p>Normally options and operands can appear in any order, and programs act
as if all the options appear before any operands.  For example,
<code>diff lao tzu -C 2</code> acts like <code>diff -C 2 lao tzu</code>, since
<code>2</code> is an option-argument of <code>-C</code>.  However, if the
<code>POSIXLY_CORRECT</code> environment variable is set, options must appear
before operands, unless otherwise specified for a particular command.

   <p>Newer versions of <small>POSIX</small> are occasionally incompatible with older
versions.  For example, older versions of <small>POSIX</small> allowed the
command <code>diff -c -10</code> to have the same meaning as <code>diff -C
10</code>, but <small>POSIX</small> 1003.1-2001 <code>diff</code> no longer allows
digit-string options like <code>-10</code>.

   <p>The <small>GNU</small> utilities normally conform to the version of <small>POSIX</small>
that is standard for your system.  To cause them to conform to a
different version of <small>POSIX</small>, define the <code>_POSIX2_VERSION</code>
environment variable to a value of the form <var>yyyymm</var> specifying
the year and month the standard was adopted.  Two values are currently
supported for <code>_POSIX2_VERSION</code>: <code>199209</code> stands for
<small>POSIX</small> 1003.2-1992, and <code>200112</code> stands for <small>POSIX</small>
1003.1-2001.  For example, if you are running older software that
assumes an older version of <small>POSIX</small> and uses <code>diff -c -10</code>,
you can work around the compatibility problems by setting
<code>_POSIX2_VERSION=199209</code> in your environment.

<h3 class="section">18.1 Suggested Projects for Improving <small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> and <code>patch</code></h3>

<p>One should be able to use <small>GNU</small> <code>diff</code> to generate a
patch from any pair of directory trees, and given the patch and a copy
of one such tree, use <code>patch</code> to generate a faithful copy of
the other.  Unfortunately, some changes to directory trees cannot be
expressed using current patch formats; also, <code>patch</code> does not
handle some of the existing formats.  These shortcomings motivate the
following suggested projects.

<h3 class="subsection">18.1.1 Handling Multibyte and Varying-Width Characters</h4>

<p><code>diff</code>, <code>diff3</code> and <code>sdiff</code> treat each line of
input as a string of unibyte characters.  This can mishandle multibyte
characters in some cases.  For example, when asked to ignore spaces,
<code>diff</code> does not properly ignore a multibyte space character.

   <p>Also, <code>diff</code> currently assumes that each byte is one column
wide, and this assumption is incorrect in some locales, e.g., locales
that use UTF-8 encoding.  This causes problems with the <code>-y</code> or
<code>--side-by-side</code> option of <code>diff</code>.

   <p>These problems need to be fixed without unduly affecting the
performance of the utilities in unibyte environments.

   <p>The IBM GNU/Linux Technology Center Internationalization Team has
proposed
<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developer/opensource/linux/patches/i18n/diffutils-2.7.2-i18n-0.1.patch.gz">patches to support internationalized <code>diff</code></a>. 
Unfortunately, these patches are incomplete and are to an older
version of <code>diff</code>, so more work needs to be done in this area.

<h3 class="subsection">18.1.2 Handling Changes to the Directory Structure</h4>

<p><code>diff</code> and <code>patch</code> do not handle some changes to directory
structure.  For example, suppose one directory tree contains a directory
named <code>D</code> with some subsidiary files, and another contains a file
with the same name <code>D</code>.  <code>diff -r</code> does not output enough
information for <code>patch</code> to transform the directory subtree into
the file.

   <p>There should be a way to specify that a file has been removed without
having to include its entire contents in the patch file.  There should
also be a way to tell <code>patch</code> that a file was renamed, even if
there is no way for <code>diff</code> to generate such information. 
There should be a way to tell <code>patch</code> that a file's time stamp
has changed, even if its contents have not changed.

   <p>These problems can be fixed by extending the <code>diff</code> output format
to represent changes in directory structure, and extending <code>patch</code>
to understand these extensions.

<h3 class="subsection">18.1.3 Files that are Neither Directories Nor Regular Files</h4>

<p>Some files are neither directories nor regular files: they are unusual
files like symbolic links, device special files, named pipes, and
sockets.  Currently, <code>diff</code> treats symbolic links as if they
were the pointed-to files, except that a recursive <code>diff</code>
reports an error if it detects infinite loops of symbolic links (e.g.,
symbolic links to <code>..</code>).  <code>diff</code> treats other special
files like regular files if they are specified at the top level, but
simply reports their presence when comparing directories.  This means
that <code>patch</code> cannot represent changes to such files.  For
example, if you change which file a symbolic link points to,
<code>diff</code> outputs the difference between the two files, instead
of the change to the symbolic link.

   <p><code>diff</code> should optionally report changes to special files specially,
and <code>patch</code> should be extended to understand these extensions.

<h3 class="subsection">18.1.4 File Names that Contain Unusual Characters</h4>

<p>When a file name contains an unusual character like a newline or
white space, <code>diff -r</code> generates a patch that <code>patch</code> cannot
parse.  The problem is with format of <code>diff</code> output, not just with
<code>patch</code>, because with odd enough file names one can cause
<code>diff</code> to generate a patch that is syntactically correct but
patches the wrong files.  The format of <code>diff</code> output should be
extended to handle all possible file names.

<h3 class="subsection">18.1.5 Outputting Diffs in Time Stamp Order</h4>

<p>Applying <code>patch</code> to a multiple-file diff can result in files
whose time stamps are out of order.  <small>GNU</small> <code>patch</code> has
options to restore the time stamps of the updated files
(see <a href="#Patching%20Time%20Stamps">Patching Time Stamps</a>), but sometimes it is useful to generate
a patch that works even if the recipient does not have <small>GNU</small> patch,
or does not use these options.  One way to do this would be to
implement a <code>diff</code> option to output diffs in time stamp order.

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">18.1.6 Ignoring Certain Changes</h4>

<p>It would be nice to have a feature for specifying two strings, one in
<var>from-file</var> and one in <var>to-file</var>, which should be considered to
match.  Thus, if the two strings are <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, then if
two lines differ only in that <code>foo</code> in file 1 corresponds to
<code>bar</code> in file 2, the lines are treated as identical.

   <p>It is not clear how general this feature can or should be, or
what syntax should be used for it.

   <p>A partial substitute is to filter one or both files before comparing,
e.g.:

<pre class="example">     sed 's/foo/bar/g' file1 | diff - file2
     </pre>

   <p>However, this outputs the filtered text, not the original.

<h3 class="subsection">18.1.7 Improving Performance</h4>

<p>When comparing two large directory structures, one of which was
originally copied from the other with time stamps preserved (e.g.,
with <code>cp -pR</code>), it would greatly improve performance if an option
told <code>diff</code> to assume that two files with the same size and
time stamps have the same content.  See <a href="#diff%20Performance">diff Performance</a>.

<div align="center">Version 1.2, November 2002</div>
<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
     </pre>

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     </p><li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<small>ASCII</small> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <small>SGML</small> or <small>XML</small> using a publicly available
<small>DTD</small>, and standard-conforming simple <small>HTML</small>,
PostScript or <small>PDF</small> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <small>PNG</small>, <small>XCF</small> and
<small>JPG</small>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <small>SGML</small> or
<small>XML</small> for which the <small>DTD</small> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <small>HTML</small>,
PostScript or <small>PDF</small> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     </p><li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p><li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p><li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p><li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all
sections Entitled "Endorsements."

     </p><li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p><li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     </p><li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     </p><li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     </p><li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        </ol>

<h3 class="appendixsubsec">A.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h4>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
     </pre>

   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
     </pre>

   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B Translations of This Manual</h2>
