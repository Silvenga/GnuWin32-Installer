  GNU Source-highlight

by Lorenzo Bettini <http://www.lorenzobettini.it>

This program, given a source file, produces a document with syntax
highlighting.

The home page is http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/

You can download it from GNU's ftp site:
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/src-highlite/ or from one of its mirrors (see
http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html).

This project's CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous
(pserver) CVS with the following instruction set. When prompted for a
password for anoncvs, simply press the Enter key.

cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/src-highlite login

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/src-highlite co src-highlite

Further instructions can be found at the address:

Related Software and Links

Martin Gebert is
also implementing a KDE interface to source-highlight programs, at the
moment it is still in beta (but he did a wonderful job!), and it is
called *ksrc2html*; if you want to test it:
http://murphy.netsolution-net.de/Ksrc2.html.

CGI support was enabled thanks to Robert Wetzel
<rw8@mail.inf.tu-dresden.de>; I
haven't tested it personally yet, so you may ask him directly.
If you want to use
source-highlight as a CGI program, you have to use the executable
*source-highlight-cgi*.

Moreover there's also a Java version of java2html, made by
bayard@generationjava.com, you can
find it at http://www.generationjava.com/java/Java2Html.shtml.


Installation

See the file INSTALL for detailed building and installation
instructions; anyway if you're used to compiling Linux software that
comes with sources you may simply follow the usual procedure:

cd /<source code main directory>
/./configure
make
make install

Note: unless you specify a different install directory by --prefix
option of configure (e.g. ./configure --prefix=/<your home>/), you must
be root to 'make install'.

It is also possible to specify as following option for
/configure/:/--enable-input-chroot/ to hardcode in the program the path
to prefix for input files.

Before you run 'make install' you may want to check that the programs
have compiled fine, so you can run 'make check'.

Files will be installed in the following directories:

    * Executables          -> /prefix/bin
    * docs and samples     -> /prefix/share/doc/source-highlight
    * conf files           -> /prefix/share/source-highlight

Default value for prefix is /usr/local but you may change it with
--prefix option to configure (see above).


Building .rpm

Christian W. Zuckschwerdt added support for building an .rpm and an
.rpm.src.  You can issue the following command

rpm -tb source-highlight-1.9rc.tar.gz

for building an .rpm with binaries and

rpm -ts source-highlight-1.9rc.tar.gz

for building an .rpm.src with sources.


What you need to build source-highlight

*Actually you need nothing more than a Unix C/C++ compiler*

source-highlight has been developed under Linux, using *gcc* (C++), and
*bison* (yacc) and *flex* (lex), and ported under Win32 with *Cygnus
C/C++*compiler, available at http://www.cygwin.com/(a .DLL is also
distributed together with the .exe: you may simply copy it in the same
place of the .exe). I used the excellent GNU *Autoconf*and*Automake*. I
also used *Autotools *(ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/elef/autotools)
which creates a starting source tree (according to GNU standards) with
autoconf, automake starting files. Finally I used GNU *gengetopt*
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt), for command line parsing.

Actually, unless you want to develop source-highlight, you don't need
all these tools to build source-highlight because I provide generated
sources; you don't need neither bison (yacc) nor flex (lex), for the
same reason. Actually programs that use lex generated files need to link
with library/libfl /(or /libl /for lex); anyway configuration phase can
discover if this library is missing and in that case it sets the program
to link with a source file I provide. This hack works for flex: I don't
know about lex generated scanners. But, again, this is a problem only if
you develop source-highlight and you use lex.


Patching from a previous version

If you downloaded a patch, say source-highlight-1.3-1.3.1-patch.gz(i.e.
the patch to go from version 1.3 to version 1.3.1), cd to the directory
with sources from the previous version (source-highlight-1.3) and type:

gunzip -cd ../source-highlight-1.3-1.3.1.patch.gz | patch -p1

and restart the compilation process (if you had already run configure a
simple make will do).


Usage and examples

See the source-highlight.html file for many examples.


Use source-highlight with less

This was suggested by Konstantine Serebriany.
The script src-hilite-lesspipe.sh will be installed together with
source-highlight.
You can use the following environment variables:

export LESSOPEN="| /path/to/src-hilite-lesspipe.sh %s"
export LESS=' -R '

This way, when you use less to browse a file, if it is a source file
handled by source-highlight, it will be automatically highlighted.

Please tell me if you like this software :-)

Actually I want to extend it, so if you have some ideas...
The most import one will be to make source-highlight more customizable :-)
