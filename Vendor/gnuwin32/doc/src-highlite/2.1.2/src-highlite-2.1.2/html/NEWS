   * a scanner for Php3 has been written by Alain Barbet.

Version 1.3

   * now there is only one program, namely source-highlight, that accepts a
     command line option, --src-lang or -s, specifying the source language
     (for the moment java, cpp and prolog).  Previous programs, java2html
     and cpp2html are provided as shell scripts, just for compatibility, but
     their use is not advised.
   * --out-format, -f, command line option added for specifying the output
     format (for the moment only html is accepted).  Though only html is
     handled, this option is required.
   * a scanner for Prolog has been written by Martin Gebert.
     This scanner is still to be considered beta,
     and actually it was written for Visual Prolog, so it should be tested
     against other Prolog dialects.
   * a scanner for Perl has been written by Alain Barbet.
   * Correctly check whether it is possible to write to a file (notified by
     Martin)
   * --tab option is correctly handled even for C/C++ files (bug fixed,

   * Man page added.

   * Fixed a problem of compilation for gcc 3.0 (thanks to Alexios Zavras
     and Bruno Schweizer)
   * much more recent versions of getopt.h, getopt.c, getopt1.c are provided
     (the previous ones were very very old!), that do not rely on alloca
     anymore.

Version 1.2

   * Added normal text decoration (specify "normal" in tags.j2h) (suggested
     by Bernie Boudet).
   * fixed a bug for multiple input files (notified by Christian Paulsen)

Version 1.1

   * Included some standard headers; otherwise gcc 2.96 didn't compile
     (thanks to Arto Viitanen).
   * fixed bug (seg.fault) with foreign character, such as ü (thanks to
     Martin Gebert).
   * --output-dir added to specify the output directory.
   * --enable-input-chroot configure option to hardcode the path to prepend
     for input files (useful when the programs are built for CGI, as
     suggested by Robert Wetzel).

Version 1.0

   * This is the first release of source-highlight, but it includes already
     existing programs (cpp2html and java2html), so the changes are related
     to these programs.
   * CGI support enabled (thanks to Robert Wetzel);
     I haven't tested it personally yet, so
     you may ask him directly.
   * newline handled correctly according to HTML specifications (again
     thanks to Robert Wetzel).

     highlighting [symbol], curly bracket highlighting [cbracket], function
     highlighting [function] (thanks to Geurt Vos).

     and colors teal, gray, and darkblue added (thanks to Geurt Vos).
   * green, darkgreen and brightgreen handled correctly (thanks to Martin
     Gebert).
