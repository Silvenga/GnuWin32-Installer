<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p><a name="index-overview-1"></a><a name="index-features-2"></a>
<!-- man begin DESCRIPTION -->
GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
the Web.  It supports <span class="sc">http</span>, <span class="sc">https</span>, and <span class="sc">ftp</span> protocols, as
well as retrieval through <span class="sc">http</span> proxies.

<!-- man end -->
<p>This chapter is a partial overview of Wget's features.

     <ul>
<li><!-- man begin DESCRIPTION -->
Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,
while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval
and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By
contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence,
which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data. 
<!-- man end -->

     <li><!-- man begin DESCRIPTION -->
Wget can follow links in <span class="sc">html</span> and <span class="sc">xhtml</span> pages and create local
versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of
the original site.  This is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;recursive
downloading.&rdquo;  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion
Standard (<span class="file">/robots.txt</span>).  Wget can be instructed to convert the
links in downloaded <span class="sc">html</span> files to the local files for offline
viewing. 
<!-- man end -->

     <li>File name wildcard matching and recursive mirroring of directories are
available when retrieving via <span class="sc">ftp</span>.  Wget can read the time-stamp
information given by both <span class="sc">http</span> and <span class="sc">ftp</span> servers, and store it
locally.  Thus Wget can see if the remote file has changed since last
retrieval, and automatically retrieve the new version if it has.  This
makes Wget suitable for mirroring of <span class="sc">ftp</span> sites, as well as home
pages.

     <li><!-- man begin DESCRIPTION -->
Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will
keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the server
supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the
download from where it left off. 
<!-- man end -->

     <li>Wget supports proxy servers, which can lighten the network load, speed
up retrieval and provide access behind firewalls.  Wget uses the passive
<span class="sc">ftp</span> downloading by default, active <span class="sc">ftp</span> being an option.

     <li>Wget supports IP version 6, the next generation of IP.  IPv6 is
autodetected at compile-time, and can be disabled at either build or
run time.  Binaries built with IPv6 support work well in both
IPv4-only and dual family environments.

     <li>Built-in features offer mechanisms to tune which links you wish to follow
(see <a href="#Following-Links">Following Links</a>).

     <li>The progress of individual downloads is traced using a progress gauge. 
Interactive downloads are tracked using a &ldquo;thermometer&rdquo;-style gauge,
whereas non-interactive ones are traced with dots, each dot
representing a fixed amount of data received (1KB by default).  Either
gauge can be customized to your preferences.

     <li>Most of the features are fully configurable, either through command line
options, or via the initialization file <span class="file">.wgetrc</span> (see <a href="#Startup-File">Startup File</a>).  Wget allows you to define <dfn>global</dfn> startup files
(<span class="file">/usr/local/etc/wgetrc</span> by default) for site settings.

     <li>Finally, GNU Wget is free software.  This means that everyone may use
it, redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, as published by the Free Software Foundation (see the
file <span class="file">COPYING</span> that came with GNU Wget, for details).

<h2 class="chapter">2 Invoking</h2>

<p><a name="index-invoking-3"></a><a name="index-command-line-4"></a><a name="index-arguments-5"></a><a name="index-nohup-6"></a>
By default, Wget is very simple to invoke.  The basic syntax is:

<pre class="example">     <!-- man begin SYNOPSIS -->
     wget [<var>option</var>]... [<var>URL</var>]...
     <!-- man end -->
</pre>
   <p>Wget will simply download all the <span class="sc">url</span>s specified on the command
line.  <var>URL</var> is a <dfn>Uniform Resource Locator</dfn>, as defined below.

   <p>However, you may wish to change some of the default parameters of
Wget.  You can do it two ways: permanently, adding the appropriate
command to <span class="file">.wgetrc</span> (see <a href="#Startup-File">Startup File</a>), or specifying it on
the command line.

<h3 class="section">2.1 URL Format</h3>

<p><a name="index-URL-7"></a><a name="index-URL-syntax-8"></a>
<dfn>URL</dfn> is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator.  A uniform
resource locator is a compact string representation for a resource
available via the Internet.  Wget recognizes the <span class="sc">url</span> syntax as per
<span class="sc">rfc1738</span>.  This is the most widely used form (square brackets denote
optional parts):

<pre class="example">     http://host[:port]/directory/file
     ftp://host[:port]/directory/file
</pre>
   <p>You can also encode your username and password within a <span class="sc">url</span>:

<pre class="example">     ftp://user:password@host/path
     http://user:password@host/path
</pre>
   <p>Either <var>user</var> or <var>password</var>, or both, may be left out.  If you
leave out either the <span class="sc">http</span> username or password, no authentication
will be sent.  If you leave out the <span class="sc">ftp</span> username, <span class="samp">anonymous</span>
will be used.  If you leave out the <span class="sc">ftp</span> password, your email
address will be supplied as a default password.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p><strong>Important Note</strong>: if you specify a password-containing <span class="sc">url</span>
on the command line, the username and password will be plainly visible
to all users on the system, by way of <code>ps</code>.  On multi-user systems,
this is a big security risk.  To work around it, use <code>wget -i -</code>
and feed the <span class="sc">url</span>s to Wget's standard input, each on a separate
line, terminated by <kbd>C-d</kbd>.

   <p>You can encode unsafe characters in a <span class="sc">url</span> as <span class="samp">%xy</span>, <code>xy</code>
being the hexadecimal representation of the character's <span class="sc">ascii</span>
value.  Some common unsafe characters include <span class="samp">%</span> (quoted as
<span class="samp">%25</span>), <span class="samp">:</span> (quoted as <span class="samp">%3A</span>), and <span class="samp">@</span> (quoted as
<span class="samp">%40</span>).  Refer to <span class="sc">rfc1738</span> for a comprehensive list of unsafe
characters.

   <p>Wget also supports the <code>type</code> feature for <span class="sc">ftp</span> <span class="sc">url</span>s.  By
default, <span class="sc">ftp</span> documents are retrieved in the binary mode (type
<span class="samp">i</span>), which means that they are downloaded unchanged.  Another
useful mode is the <span class="samp">a</span> (<dfn>ASCII</dfn>) mode, which converts the line
delimiters between the different operating systems, and is thus useful
for text files.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     ftp://host/directory/file;type=a
</pre>
   <p>Two alternative variants of <span class="sc">url</span> specification are also supported,
because of historical (hysterical?) reasons and their widespreaded use.

   <p><span class="sc">ftp</span>-only syntax (supported by <code>NcFTP</code>):
<pre class="example">     host:/dir/file
</pre>
   <p><span class="sc">http</span>-only syntax (introduced by <code>Netscape</code>):
<pre class="example">     host[:port]/dir/file
</pre>
   <p>These two alternative forms are deprecated, and may cease being
supported in the future.

   <p>If you do not understand the difference between these notations, or do
not know which one to use, just use the plain ordinary format you use
with your favorite browser, like <code>Lynx</code> or <code>Netscape</code>.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Option Syntax</h3>

<p><a name="index-option-syntax-9"></a><a name="index-syntax-of-options-10"></a>
Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every
option has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are
more convenient to remember, but take time to type.  You may freely
mix different option styles, or specify options after the command-line
arguments.  Thus you may write:

<pre class="example">     wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log
</pre>
   <p>The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may
be omitted.  Instead of <span class="samp">-o log</span> you can write <span class="samp">-olog</span>.

   <p>You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
like:

<pre class="example">     wget -drc <var>URL</var>
</pre>
   <p>This is a complete equivalent of:

<pre class="example">     wget -d -r -c <var>URL</var>
</pre>
   <p>Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
terminate them with <span class="samp">--</span>.  So the following will try to download
<span class="sc">url</span> <span class="samp">-x</span>, reporting failure to <span class="file">log</span>:

<pre class="example">     wget -o log -- -x
</pre>
   <p>The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the convention
that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be useful to
clear the <span class="file">.wgetrc</span> settings.  For instance, if your <span class="file">.wgetrc</span>
sets <code>exclude_directories</code> to <span class="file">/cgi-bin</span>, the following
example will first reset it, and then set it to exclude <span class="file">/~nobody</span>
and <span class="file">/~somebody</span>.  You can also clear the lists in <span class="file">.wgetrc</span>
(see <a href="#Wgetrc-Syntax">Wgetrc Syntax</a>).

<pre class="example">     wget -X '' -X /~nobody,/~somebody
</pre>
   <p>Most options that do not accept arguments are <dfn>boolean</dfn> options,
so named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no
(&ldquo;boolean&rdquo;) variable.  For example, <span class="samp">--follow-ftp</span> tells Wget
to follow FTP links from HTML files and, on the other hand,
<span class="samp">--no-glob</span> tells it not to perform file globbing on FTP URLs.  A
boolean option is either <dfn>affirmative</dfn> or <dfn>negative</dfn>
(beginning with <span class="samp">--no</span>).  All such options share several
properties.

   <p>Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is
the opposite of what the option accomplishes.  For example, the
documented existence of <span class="samp">--follow-ftp</span> assumes that the default
is to <em>not</em> follow FTP links from HTML pages.

   <p>Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the <span class="samp">--no-</span> to
the option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the
<span class="samp">--no-</span> prefix.  This might seem superfluous&mdash;if the default for
an affirmative option is to not do something, then why provide a way
to explicitly turn it off?  But the startup file may in fact change
the default.  For instance, using <code>follow_ftp = off</code> in
<span class="file">.wgetrc</span> makes Wget <em>not</em> follow FTP links by default, and
using <span class="samp">--no-follow-ftp</span> is the only way to restore the factory
default from the command line.

which are not retried.

is used as <var>file</var>, documents will be printed to standard output,
disabling link conversion.  (Use <span class="samp">./-</span> to print to a file
literally named <span class="samp">-</span>.)

     <p>Use of <span class="samp">-O</span> is <em>not</em> intended to mean simply &ldquo;use the name
<var>file</var> instead of the one in the URL;&rdquo; rather, it is
analogous to shell redirection:
<span class="samp">wget -O file http://foo</span> is intended to work like
<span class="samp">wget -O - http://foo &gt; file</span>; <span class="file">file</span> will be truncated
immediately, and <em>all</em> downloaded content will be written there.

     <p>For this reason, <span class="samp">-N</span> (for timestamp-checking) is not supported
in combination with <span class="samp">-O</span>: since <var>file</var> is always newly
created, it will always have a very new timestamp. A warning will be
issued if this combination is used.

     <p>Similarly, using <span class="samp">-r</span> or <span class="samp">-p</span> with <span class="samp">-O</span> may not work as
you expect: Wget won't just download the first file to <var>file</var> and
then download the rest to their normal names: <em>all</em> downloaded
content will be placed in <var>file</var>. This was disabled in version
1.11, but has been reinstated (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as there are
some cases where this behavior can actually have some use.

     <p>Note that a combination with <span class="samp">-k</span> is only permitted when
downloading a single document, as in that case it will just convert
all relative URIs to external ones; <span class="samp">-k</span> makes no sense for
multiple URIs when they're all being downloaded to a single file.

     <p><a name="index-clobbering_002c-file-27"></a><a name="index-downloading-multiple-times-28"></a><a name="index-no_002dclobber-29"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">-nc</span><dt><span class="samp">--no-clobber</span><dd>If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory, Wget's
behavior depends on a few options, including <span class="samp">-nc</span>.  In certain
cases, the local file will be <dfn>clobbered</dfn>, or overwritten, upon
repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.

     <p>When running Wget without <span class="samp">-N</span>, <span class="samp">-nc</span>, <span class="samp">-r</span>, or <span class="samp">p</span>,
downloading the same file in the same directory will result in the
original copy of <var>file</var> being preserved and the second copy being
named <var>file</var><span class="samp">.1</span>.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the
third copy will be named <var>file</var><span class="samp">.2</span>, and so on.  When
<span class="samp">-nc</span> is specified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will
refuse to download newer copies of <var>file</var>.  Therefore,
&ldquo;<code>no-clobber</code>&rdquo; is actually a misnomer in this mode&mdash;it's not
clobbering that's prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already
preventing clobbering), but rather the multiple version saving that's
prevented.

     <p>When running Wget with <span class="samp">-r</span> or <span class="samp">-p</span>, but without <span class="samp">-N</span>
or <span class="samp">-nc</span>, re-downloading a file will result in the new copy
simply overwriting the old.  Adding <span class="samp">-nc</span> will prevent this
behavior, instead causing the original version to be preserved and any
newer copies on the server to be ignored.

     <p>When running Wget with <span class="samp">-N</span>, with or without <span class="samp">-r</span> or
<span class="samp">-p</span>, the decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy
of a file depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the
file (see <a href="#Time_002dStamping">Time-Stamping</a>).  <span class="samp">-nc</span> may not be specified at the
same time as <span class="samp">-N</span>.

     <p>Note that when <span class="samp">-nc</span> is specified, files with the suffixes
<span class="samp">.html</span> or <span class="samp">.htm</span> will be loaded from the local disk and
parsed as if they had been retrieved from the Web.

     <p><a name="index-continue-retrieval-30"></a><a name="index-incomplete-downloads-31"></a><a name="index-resume-download-32"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">-c</span><dt><span class="samp">--continue</span><dd>Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when you
want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or
by another program.  For instance:

     <pre class="example">          wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z
     </pre>
     <p>If there is a file named <span class="file">ls-lR.Z</span> in the current directory, Wget
will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will
ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the
length of the local file.

     <p>Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want the
current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should the
connection be lost midway through.  This is the default behavior. 
<span class="samp">-c</span> only affects resumption of downloads started <em>prior</em> to
this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting around.

     <p>Without <span class="samp">-c</span>, the previous example would just download the remote
file to <span class="file">ls-lR.Z.1</span>, leaving the truncated <span class="file">ls-lR.Z</span> file
alone.

     <p>Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use <span class="samp">-c</span> on a non-empty file, and
it turns out that the server does not support continued downloading,
Wget will refuse to start the download from scratch, which would
effectively ruin existing contents.  If you really want the download to
start from scratch, remove the file.

     <p>Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use <span class="samp">-c</span> on a file which is of
equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the
file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when the file
is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it was changed
on the server since your last download attempt)&mdash;because &ldquo;continuing&rdquo;
is not meaningful, no download occurs.

     <p>On the other side of the coin, while using <span class="samp">-c</span>, any file that's
bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
download and only <code>(length(remote) - length(local))</code> bytes will be
downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This behavior can
be desirable in certain cases&mdash;for instance, you can use <span class="samp">wget -c</span>
to download just the new portion that's been appended to a data
collection or log file.

     <p>However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
<em>changed</em>, as opposed to just <em>appended</em> to, you'll end up
with a garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file
is really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be especially
careful of this when using <span class="samp">-c</span> in conjunction with <span class="samp">-r</span>,
since every file will be considered as an "incomplete download" candidate.

     <p>Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use
<span class="samp">-c</span> is if you have a lame <span class="sc">http</span> proxy that inserts a
&ldquo;transfer interrupted&rdquo; string into the local file.  In the future a
&ldquo;rollback&rdquo; option may be added to deal with this case.

     <p>Note that <span class="samp">-c</span> only works with <span class="sc">ftp</span> servers and with <span class="sc">http</span>
servers that support the <code>Range</code> header.

indicators are &ldquo;dot&rdquo; and &ldquo;bar&rdquo;.

     <p>The &ldquo;bar&rdquo; indicator is used by default.  It draws an <span class="sc">ascii</span> progress
bar graphics (a.k.a &ldquo;thermometer&rdquo; display) indicating the status of
retrieval.  If the output is not a TTY, the &ldquo;dot&rdquo; bar will be used by
default.

     <p>Use <span class="samp">--progress=dot</span> to switch to the &ldquo;dot&rdquo; display.  It traces
the retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
fixed amount of downloaded data.

     <p>When using the dotted retrieval, you may also set the <dfn>style</dfn> by
specifying the type as <span class="samp">dot:</span><var>style</var>.  Different styles assign
different meaning to one dot.  With the <code>default</code> style each dot
represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a line. 
The <code>binary</code> style has a more &ldquo;computer&rdquo;-like orientation&mdash;8K
dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K
lines).  The <code>mega</code> style is suitable for downloading very large
files&mdash;each dot represents 64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a
cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M).

     <p>Note that you can set the default style using the <code>progress</code>
command in <span class="file">.wgetrc</span>.  That setting may be overridden from the
command line.  The exception is that, when the output is not a TTY, the
&ldquo;dot&rdquo; progress will be favored over &ldquo;bar&rdquo;.  To force the bar output,
use <span class="samp">--progress=bar:force</span>.

     <p>When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and
abort the operation if it takes too long.  This prevents anomalies
like hanging reads and infinite connects.  The only timeout enabled by
default is a 900-second read timeout.  Setting a timeout to 0 disables
it altogether.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is best not to
change the default timeout settings.

     <p>All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as
subsecond values.  For example, <span class="samp">0.1</span> seconds is a legal (though
unwise) choice of timeout.  Subsecond timeouts are useful for checking

does not directly affect the duration of the entire download.

     <p>Of course, the remote server may choose to terminate the connection

limit the retrieval rate to 20KB/s.  This is useful when, for whatever
reason, you don't want Wget to consume the entire available bandwidth.

     <p>This option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in conjunction
with power suffixes; for example, <span class="samp">--limit-rate=2.5k</span> is a legal
value.

     <p>Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate
amount of time after a network read that took less time than specified
by the rate.  Eventually this strategy causes the TCP transfer to slow
down to approximately the specified rate.  However, it may take some
time for this balance to be achieved, so don't be surprised if limiting
the rate doesn't work well with very small files.

requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the time can be
specified in minutes using the <code>m</code> suffix, in hours using <code>h</code>
suffix, or in days using <code>d</code> suffix.

     <p>Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network or the
destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough to
reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the retry.  The
waiting interval specified by this function is influenced by
<code>--random-wait</code>, which see.

file, up to the maximum number of <var>seconds</var> you specify.  Therefore,
a value of 10 will actually make Wget wait up to (1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55
seconds per file.

     <p>Note that this option is turned on by default in the global
<span class="file">wgetrc</span> file.

     <p>A 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a popular
consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on the fly. 
Its author suggested blocking at the class C address level to ensure
automated retrieval programs were blocked despite changing DHCP-supplied

     <p>Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So if you
specify <span class="samp">wget -Q10k ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls-lR.gz</span>, all of the
<span class="file">ls-lR.gz</span> will be downloaded.  The same goes even when several
<span class="sc">url</span>s are specified on the command-line.  However, quota is
respected when retrieving either recursively, or from an input file. 
Thus you may safely type <span class="samp">wget -Q2m -i sites</span>&mdash;download will be

addresses it looked up from DNS so it doesn't have to repeatedly
contact the DNS server for the same (typically small) set of hosts it
retrieves from.  This cache exists in memory only; a new Wget run will
contact DNS again.

     <p>However, it has been reported that in some situations it is not
desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a
short-running application like Wget.  With this option Wget issues a
new DNS lookup (more precisely, a new call to <code>gethostbyname</code> or
<code>getaddrinfo</code>) each time it makes a new connection.  Please note
that this option will <em>not</em> affect caching that might be
performed by the resolving library or by an external caching layer,
such as NSCD.

by this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with <span class="samp">%HH</span>, where
<span class="samp">HH</span> is the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the restricted
character.

     <p>By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid as part of
file names on your operating system, as well as control characters that
are typically unprintable.  This option is useful for changing these
defaults, either because you are downloading to a non-native partition,
or because you want to disable escaping of the control characters.

     <p>When mode is set to &ldquo;unix&rdquo;, Wget escapes the character <span class="samp">/</span> and
the control characters in the ranges 0&ndash;31 and 128&ndash;159.  This is the
default on Unix-like OS'es.

     <p>When mode is set to &ldquo;windows&rdquo;, Wget escapes the characters <span class="samp">\</span>,
<span class="samp">|</span>, <span class="samp">/</span>, <span class="samp">:</span>, <span class="samp">?</span>, <span class="samp">"</span>, <span class="samp">*</span>, <span class="samp">&lt;</span>,
<span class="samp">&gt;</span>, and the control characters in the ranges 0&ndash;31 and 128&ndash;159. 
In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode uses <span class="samp">+</span> instead of
<span class="samp">:</span> to separate host and port in local file names, and uses
<span class="samp">@</span> instead of <span class="samp">?</span> to separate the query portion of the file
name from the rest.  Therefore, a URL that would be saved as
<span class="samp">www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah</span> in Unix mode would be
saved as <span class="samp">www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah</span> in Windows
mode.  This mode is the default on Windows.

     <p>If you append <span class="samp">,nocontrol</span> to the mode, as in
<span class="samp">unix,nocontrol</span>, escaping of the control characters is also
switched off.  You can use <span class="samp">--restrict-file-names=nocontrol</span> to
turn off escaping of control characters without affecting the choice of
the OS to use as file name restriction mode.

only connect to IPv6 hosts and ignore A records and IPv4 addresses.

     <p>Neither options should be needed normally.  By default, an IPv6-aware
Wget will use the address family specified by the host's DNS record. 
If the DNS responds with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, Wget will try
them in sequence until it finds one it can connect to.  (Also see

<span class="samp">--inet6-only</span> and <span class="samp">--inet4-only</span> may be specified at the
same time.  Neither option is available in Wget compiled without IPv6
support.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">--prefer-family=IPv4/IPv6/none</span><dd>When given a choice of several addresses, connect to the addresses
with specified address family first.  IPv4 addresses are preferred by
default.

     <p>This avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when accessing hosts
that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses from IPv4 networks.  For
example, <span class="samp">www.kame.net</span> resolves to
<span class="samp">2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085</span> and to
<span class="samp">203.178.141.194</span>.  When the preferred family is <code>IPv4</code>, the
IPv4 address is used first; when the preferred family is <code>IPv6</code>,
the IPv6 address is used first; if the specified value is <code>none</code>,
the address order returned by DNS is used without change.

     <p>Unlike <span class="samp">-4</span> and <span class="samp">-6</span>, this option doesn't inhibit access to
any address family, it only changes the <em>order</em> in which the
addresses are accessed.  Also note that the reordering performed by
this option is <dfn>stable</dfn>&mdash;it doesn't affect order of addresses of
the same family.  That is, the relative order of all IPv4 addresses
and of all IPv6 addresses remains intact in all cases.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">--retry-connrefused</span><dd>Consider &ldquo;connection refused&rdquo; a transient error and try again. 
Normally Wget gives up on a URL when it is unable to connect to the
site because failure to connect is taken as a sign that the server is
not running at all and that retries would not help.  This option is
for mirroring unreliable sites whose servers tend to disappear for
short periods of time.

<dt><span class="samp">-nd</span><dt><span class="samp">--no-directories</span><dd>Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving recursively. 
With this option turned on, all files will get saved to the current

     <br><dt><span class="samp">-x</span><dt><span class="samp">--force-directories</span><dd>The opposite of <span class="samp">-nd</span>&mdash;create a hierarchy of directories, even if
one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g. <span class="samp">wget -x

<span class="file">fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt</span>.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">-nH</span><dt><span class="samp">--no-host-directories</span><dd>Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default, invoking
Wget with <span class="samp">-r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</span> will create a structure of
directories beginning with <span class="file">fly.srk.fer.hr/</span>.  This option disables
such behavior.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">--protocol-directories</span><dd>Use the protocol name as a directory component of local file names.  For
example, with this option, <span class="samp">wget -r http://</span><var>host</var> will save to
<span class="samp">http/</span><var>host</var><span class="samp">/...</span> rather than just to <var>host</var><span class="samp">/...</span>.

     <p><a name="index-cut-directories-64"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--cut-dirs=</span><var>number</var><dd>Ignore <var>number</var> directory components.  This is useful for getting a
fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval will
be saved.

     <p>Take, for example, the directory at
<span class="samp">ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</span>.  If you retrieve it with
<span class="samp">-r</span>, it will be saved locally under
<span class="file">ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</span>.  While the <span class="samp">-nH</span> option can
remove the <span class="file">ftp.xemacs.org/</span> part, you are still stuck with
<span class="file">pub/xemacs</span>.  This is where <span class="samp">--cut-dirs</span> comes in handy; it
makes Wget not &ldquo;see&rdquo; <var>number</var> remote directory components.  Here
are several examples of how <span class="samp">--cut-dirs</span> option works.

     <pre class="example">          No options        -&gt; ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
          -nH               -&gt; pub/xemacs/

          --cut-dirs=1      -&gt; ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
          ...
     </pre>
     <p>If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this option is
similar to a combination of <span class="samp">-nd</span> and <span class="samp">-P</span>.  However, unlike
<span class="samp">-nd</span>, <span class="samp">--cut-dirs</span> does not lose with subdirectories&mdash;for
instance, with <span class="samp">-nH --cut-dirs=1</span>, a <span class="file">beta/</span> subdirectory will
be placed to <span class="file">xemacs/beta</span>, as one would expect.

downloaded and the URL does not end with the regexp
<span class="samp">\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?</span>, this option will cause the suffix <span class="samp">.html</span>
to be appended to the local filename.  This is useful, for instance, when
you're mirroring a remote site that uses <span class="samp">.asp</span> pages, but you want
the mirrored pages to be viewable on your stock Apache server.  Another
good use for this is when you're downloading CGI-generated materials.  A URL
like <span class="samp">http://site.com/article.cgi?25</span> will be saved as
<span class="file">article.cgi?25.html</span>.

     <p>Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every time
you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that the local
<var>X</var><span class="file">.html</span> file corresponds to remote URL <var>X</var> (since
it doesn't yet know that the URL produces output of type
<span class="samp">text/html</span> or <span class="samp">application/xhtml+xml</span>.  To prevent this
re-downloading, you must use <span class="samp">-k</span> and <span class="samp">-K</span> so that the original
version of the file will be saved as <var>X</var><span class="file">.orig</span> (see <a href="#Recursive-Retrieval-Options">Recursive Retrieval Options</a>).

encode them using either the <code>basic</code> (insecure),
the <code>digest</code>, or the Windows <code>NTLM</code> authentication scheme.

     <p>Another way to specify username and password is in the <span class="sc">url</span> itself
(see <a href="#URL-Format">URL Format</a>).  Either method reveals your password to anyone who
bothers to run <code>ps</code>.  To prevent the passwords from being seen,
store them in <span class="file">.wgetrc</span> or <span class="file">.netrc</span>, and make sure to protect
those files from other users with <code>chmod</code>.  If the passwords are
really important, do not leave them lying in those files either&mdash;edit
the files and delete them after Wget has started the download.

     <p><a name="index-proxy-70"></a><a name="index-cache-71"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--no-cache</span><dd>Disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget will send the remote

file from the remote service, rather than returning the cached version. 
This is especially useful for retrieving and flushing out-of-date
documents on proxy servers.

     <p>Caching is allowed by default.

     <p><a name="index-cookies-72"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--no-cookies</span><dd>Disable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a mechanism for maintaining
server-side state.  The server sends the client a cookie using the
<code>Set-Cookie</code> header, and the client responds with the same cookie
upon further requests.  Since cookies allow the server owners to keep
track of visitors and for sites to exchange this information, some
consider them a breach of privacy.  The default is to use cookies;
however, <em>storing</em> cookies is not on by default.

     <p><a name="index-loading-cookies-73"></a><a name="index-cookies_002c-loading-74"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--load-cookies </span><var>file</var><dd>Load cookies from <var>file</var> before the first HTTP retrieval. 
<var>file</var> is a textual file in the format originally used by Netscape's
<span class="file">cookies.txt</span> file.

     <p>You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that require
that you be logged in to access some or all of their content.  The login
process typically works by the web server issuing an <span class="sc">http</span> cookie
upon receiving and verifying your credentials.  The cookie is then
resent by the browser when accessing that part of the site, and so
proves your identity.

     <p>Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your
browser sends when communicating with the site.  This is achieved by
<span class="samp">--load-cookies</span>&mdash;simply point Wget to the location of the
<span class="file">cookies.txt</span> file, and it will send the same cookies your browser
would send in the same situation.  Different browsers keep textual
cookie files in different locations:

          <dl>
<dt>Netscape 4.x.<dd>The cookies are in <span class="file">~/.netscape/cookies.txt</span>.

          <br><dt>Mozilla and Netscape 6.x.<dd>Mozilla's cookie file is also named <span class="file">cookies.txt</span>, located
somewhere under <span class="file">~/.mozilla</span>, in the directory of your profile. 
The full path usually ends up looking somewhat like
<span class="file">~/.mozilla/default/</span><var>some-weird-string</var><span class="file">/cookies.txt</span>.

          <br><dt>Internet Explorer.<dd>You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the File menu,
Import and Export, Export Cookies.  This has been tested with Internet
Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed to work with earlier versions.

          <br><dt>Other browsers.<dd>If you are using a different browser to create your cookies,
<span class="samp">--load-cookies</span> will only work if you can locate or produce a
cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget expects. 
</dl>

     <p>If you cannot use <span class="samp">--load-cookies</span>, there might still be an
alternative.  If your browser supports a &ldquo;cookie manager&rdquo;, you can use
it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you're mirroring. 
Write down the name and value of the cookie, and manually instruct Wget
to send those cookies, bypassing the &ldquo;official&rdquo; cookie support:

     <pre class="example">          wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: <var>name</var>=<var>value</var>"
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-saving-cookies-75"></a><a name="index-cookies_002c-saving-76"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--save-cookies </span><var>file</var><dd>Save cookies to <var>file</var> before exiting.  This will not save cookies
that have expired or that have no expiry time (so-called &ldquo;session
cookies&rdquo;), but also see <span class="samp">--keep-session-cookies</span>.

     <p><a name="index-cookies_002c-session-77"></a><a name="index-session-cookies-78"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--keep-session-cookies</span><dd>When specified, causes <span class="samp">--save-cookies</span> to also save session
cookies.  Session cookies are normally not saved because they are
meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser. 
Saving them is useful on sites that require you to log in or to visit
the home page before you can access some pages.  With this option,
multiple Wget runs are considered a single browser session as far as
the site is concerned.

     <p>Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session cookies,
Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0.  Wget's
<span class="samp">--load-cookies</span> recognizes those as session cookies, but it might
confuse other browsers.  Also note that cookies so loaded will be
treated as other session cookies, which means that if you want
<span class="samp">--save-cookies</span> to preserve them again, you must use
<span class="samp">--keep-session-cookies</span> again.

     <p><a name="index-Content_002dLength_002c-ignore-79"></a><a name="index-ignore-length-80"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--ignore-length</span><dd>Unfortunately, some <span class="sc">http</span> servers (<span class="sc">cgi</span> programs, to be more
precise) send out bogus <code>Content-Length</code> headers, which makes Wget
go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can spot
this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again and again,
each time claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has closed on
the very same byte.

     <p>With this option, Wget will ignore the <code>Content-Length</code> header&mdash;as
if it never existed.

     <p><a name="index-header_002c-add-81"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--header=</span><var>header-line</var><dd>Send <var>header-line</var> along with the rest of the headers in each
<span class="sc">http</span> request.  The supplied header is sent as-is, which means it
must contain name and value separated by colon, and must not contain
newlines.

     <p>You may define more than one additional header by specifying
<span class="samp">--header</span> more than once.

     <pre class="example">          wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \
               --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \
                 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/
     </pre>
     <p>Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all
previous user-defined headers.

     <p>As of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers otherwise
generated automatically.  This example instructs Wget to connect to
localhost, but to specify <span class="samp">foo.bar</span> in the <code>Host</code> header:

     <pre class="example">          wget --header="Host: foo.bar" http://localhost/
     </pre>
     <p>In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of <span class="samp">--header</span> caused
sending of duplicate headers.

     <p><a name="index-redirect-82"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--max-redirect=</span><var>number</var><dd>Specifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a resource. 
The default is 20, which is usually far more than necessary. However, on
those occasions where you want to allow more (or fewer), this is the
option to use.

authentication on a proxy server.  Wget will encode them using the
<code>basic</code> authentication scheme.

     <p>Security considerations similar to those with <span class="samp">--http-password</span>
pertain here as well.

     <p><a name="index-http-referer-86"></a><a name="index-referer_002c-http-87"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--referer=</span><var>url</var><dd>Include `Referer: <var>url</var>' header in HTTP request.  Useful for
retrieving documents with server-side processing that assume they are
always being retrieved by interactive web browsers and only come out
properly when Referer is set to one of the pages that point to them.

     <p><a name="index-server-response_002c-save-88"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--save-headers</span><dd>Save the headers sent by the <span class="sc">http</span> server to the file, preceding the

     <p><a name="index-user_002dagent-89"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">-U </span><var>agent-string</var><dt><span class="samp">--user-agent=</span><var>agent-string</var><dd>Identify as <var>agent-string</var> to the <span class="sc">http</span> server.

     <p>The <span class="sc">http</span> protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a
<code>User-Agent</code> header field.  This enables distinguishing the
<span class="sc">www</span> software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as
<span class="samp">Wget/</span><var>version</var>, <var>version</var> being the current version
number of Wget.

     <p>However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of tailoring
the output according to the <code>User-Agent</code>-supplied information. 
While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has been abused by
servers denying information to clients other than (historically)
Netscape or, more frequently, Microsoft Internet Explorer.  This
option allows you to change the <code>User-Agent</code> line issued by Wget. 
Use of this option is discouraged, unless you really know what you are
doing.

     <p>Specifying empty user agent with <span class="samp">--user-agent=""</span> instructs Wget
not to send the <code>User-Agent</code> header in <span class="sc">http</span> requests.

     <p><a name="index-POST-90"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--post-data=</span><var>string</var><dt><span class="samp">--post-file=</span><var>file</var><dd>Use POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the specified data
in the request body.  <code>--post-data</code> sends <var>string</var> as data,
whereas <code>--post-file</code> sends the contents of <var>file</var>.  Other than
that, they work in exactly the same way.

     <p>Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the POST data in
advance.  Therefore the argument to <code>--post-file</code> must be a regular
file; specifying a FIFO or something like <span class="file">/dev/stdin</span> won't work. 
It's not quite clear how to work around this limitation inherent in
HTTP/1.0.  Although HTTP/1.1 introduces <dfn>chunked</dfn> transfer that
doesn't require knowing the request length in advance, a client can't
use chunked unless it knows it's talking to an HTTP/1.1 server.  And it
can't know that until it receives a response, which in turn requires the
request to have been completed &ndash; a chicken-and-egg problem.

     <p>Note: if Wget is redirected after the POST request is completed, it
will not send the POST data to the redirected URL.  This is because
URLs that process POST often respond with a redirection to a regular
page, which does not desire or accept POST.  It is not completely
clear that this behavior is optimal; if it doesn't work out, it might
be changed in the future.

     <p>This example shows how to log to a server using POST and then proceed to
download the desired pages, presumably only accessible to authorized
users:

     <pre class="example">          # <span class="roman">Log in to the server.  This can be done only once.</span>
          wget --save-cookies cookies.txt \
               --post-data 'user=foo&amp;password=bar' \
               http://server.com/auth.php
          
          # <span class="roman">Now grab the page or pages we care about.</span>
          wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
               -p http://server.com/interesting/article.php
     </pre>
     <p>If the server is using session cookies to track user authentication,
the above will not work because <span class="samp">--save-cookies</span> will not save
them (and neither will browsers) and the <span class="file">cookies.txt</span> file will
be empty.  In that case use <span class="samp">--keep-session-cookies</span> along with
<span class="samp">--save-cookies</span> to force saving of session cookies.

     <p><a name="index-Content_002dDisposition-91"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--content-disposition</span><dd>
If this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional) support for
<code>Content-Disposition</code> headers is enabled. This can currently result in
extra round-trips to the server for a <code>HEAD</code> request, and is known
to suffer from a few bugs, which is why it is not currently enabled by default.

     <p>This option is useful for some file-downloading CGI programs that use
<code>Content-Disposition</code> headers to describe what the name of a
downloaded file should be.

     <p><a name="index-authentication-92"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--auth-no-challenge</span><dd>
If this option is given, Wget will send Basic HTTP authentication
information (plaintext username and password) for all requests, just
like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by default.

     <p>Use of this option is not recommended, and is intended only to support
some few obscure servers, which never send HTTP authentication
challenges, but accept unsolicited auth info, say, in addition to
form-based authentication.

<h3 class="section">2.8 HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options</h3>

<p><a name="index-SSL-93"></a>To support encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) downloads, Wget must be compiled
with an external SSL library, currently OpenSSL.  If Wget is compiled
without SSL support, none of these options are available.

     
<a name="index-SSL-protocol_002c-choose-94"></a>
<dl><dt><span class="samp">--secure-protocol=</span><var>protocol</var><dd>Choose the secure protocol to be used.  Legal values are <span class="samp">auto</span>,
<span class="samp">SSLv2</span>, <span class="samp">SSLv3</span>, and <span class="samp">TLSv1</span>.  If <span class="samp">auto</span> is used,
the SSL library is given the liberty of choosing the appropriate
protocol automatically, which is achieved by sending an SSLv2 greeting
and announcing support for SSLv3 and TLSv1.  This is the default.

     <p>Specifying <span class="samp">SSLv2</span>, <span class="samp">SSLv3</span>, or <span class="samp">TLSv1</span> forces the use
of the corresponding protocol.  This is useful when talking to old and
buggy SSL server implementations that make it hard for OpenSSL to
choose the correct protocol version.  Fortunately, such servers are
quite rare.

     <p><a name="index-SSL-certificate_002c-check-95"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--no-check-certificate</span><dd>Don't check the server certificate against the available certificate
authorities.  Also don't require the URL host name to match the common
name presented by the certificate.

     <p>As of Wget 1.10, the default is to verify the server's certificate
against the recognized certificate authorities, breaking the SSL
handshake and aborting the download if the verification fails. 
Although this provides more secure downloads, it does break
interoperability with some sites that worked with previous Wget
versions, particularly those using self-signed, expired, or otherwise
invalid certificates.  This option forces an &ldquo;insecure&rdquo; mode of
operation that turns the certificate verification errors into warnings
and allows you to proceed.

     <p>If you encounter &ldquo;certificate verification&rdquo; errors or ones saying
that &ldquo;common name doesn't match requested host name&rdquo;, you can use
this option to bypass the verification and proceed with the download.

<dl><dt><span class="samp">--ftp-user=</span><var>user</var><dt><span class="samp">--ftp-password=</span><var>password</var><dd>Specify the username <var>user</var> and password <var>password</var> on an
<span class="sc">ftp</span> server.  Without this, or the corresponding startup option,
the password defaults to <span class="samp">-wget@</span>, normally used for anonymous
FTP.

     <p>Another way to specify username and password is in the <span class="sc">url</span> itself
(see <a href="#URL-Format">URL Format</a>).  Either method reveals your password to anyone who
bothers to run <code>ps</code>.  To prevent the passwords from being seen,
store them in <span class="file">.wgetrc</span> or <span class="file">.netrc</span>, and make sure to protect
those files from other users with <code>chmod</code>.  If the passwords are
really important, do not leave them lying in those files either&mdash;edit
the files and delete them after Wget has started the download.

     <p><a name="index-_002elisting-files_002c-removing-105"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--no-remove-listing</span><dd>Don't remove the temporary <span class="file">.listing</span> files generated by <span class="sc">ftp</span>
retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory listings
received from <span class="sc">ftp</span> servers.  Not removing them can be useful for
debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to easily check on the
contents of remote server directories (e.g. to verify that a mirror
you're running is complete).

     <p>Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this file,
this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
<span class="file">.listing</span> a symbolic link to <span class="file">/etc/passwd</span> or something and
asking <code>root</code> to run Wget in his or her directory.  Depending on
the options used, either Wget will refuse to write to <span class="file">.listing</span>,
making the globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the
symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual
<span class="file">.listing</span> file, or the listing will be written to a
<span class="file">.listing.</span><var>number</var> file.

     <p>Even though this situation isn't a problem, though, <code>root</code> should
never run Wget in a non-trusted user's directory.  A user could do
something as simple as linking <span class="file">index.html</span> to <span class="file">/etc/passwd</span>
and asking <code>root</code> to run Wget with <span class="samp">-N</span> or <span class="samp">-r</span> so the file
will be overwritten.

     <p><a name="index-globbing_002c-toggle-106"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--no-glob</span><dd>Turn off <span class="sc">ftp</span> globbing.  Globbing refers to the use of shell-like
special characters (<dfn>wildcards</dfn>), like <span class="samp">*</span>, <span class="samp">?</span>, <span class="samp">[</span>
and <span class="samp">]</span> to retrieve more than one file from the same directory at
once, like:

     <pre class="example">          wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg
     </pre>
     <p>By default, globbing will be turned on if the <span class="sc">url</span> contains a
globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on or off
permanently.

     <p>You may have to quote the <span class="sc">url</span> to protect it from being expanded by
your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing, which is
system-specific.  This is why it currently works only with Unix <span class="sc">ftp</span>
servers (and the ones emulating Unix <code>ls</code> output).

     <p><a name="index-passive-ftp-107"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--no-passive-ftp</span><dd>Disable the use of the <dfn>passive</dfn> FTP transfer mode.  Passive FTP
mandates that the client connect to the server to establish the data
connection rather than the other way around.

     <p>If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both passive and
active FTP should work equally well.  Behind most firewall and NAT
configurations passive FTP has a better chance of working.  However,
in some rare firewall configurations, active FTP actually works when
passive FTP doesn't.  If you suspect this to be the case, use this
option, or set <code>passive_ftp=off</code> in your init file.

     <p><a name="index-symbolic-links_002c-retrieving-108"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--retr-symlinks</span><dd>Usually, when retrieving <span class="sc">ftp</span> directories recursively and a symbolic
link is encountered, the linked-to file is not downloaded.  Instead, a
matching symbolic link is created on the local filesystem.  The
pointed-to file will not be downloaded unless this recursive retrieval
would have encountered it separately and downloaded it anyway.

     <p>When <span class="samp">--retr-symlinks</span> is specified, however, symbolic links are
traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved.  At this time, this
option does not cause Wget to traverse symlinks to directories and
recurse through them, but in the future it should be enhanced to do
this.

     <p>Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
specified on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed to,
this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are always traversed in this
case.

     <p><a name="index-Keep_002dAlive_002c-turning-off-109"></a><a name="index-Persistent-Connections_002c-disabling-110"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--no-http-keep-alive</span><dd>Turn off the &ldquo;keep-alive&rdquo; feature for HTTP downloads.  Normally, Wget
asks the server to keep the connection open so that, when you download
more than one document from the same server, they get transferred over
the same TCP connection.  This saves time and at the same time reduces
the load on the server.

     <p>This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent (keep-alive)
connections don't work for you, for example due to a server bug or due
to the inability of server-side scripts to cope with the connections.

<em>after</em> having done so.  It is useful for pre-fetching popular
pages through a proxy, e.g.:

     <pre class="example">          wget -r -nd --delete-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/
     </pre>
     <p>The <span class="samp">-r</span> option is to retrieve recursively, and <span class="samp">-nd</span> to not
create directories.

     <p>Note that <span class="samp">--delete-after</span> deletes files on the local machine.  It
does not issue the <span class="samp">DELE</span> command to remote FTP sites, for
instance.  Also note that when <span class="samp">--delete-after</span> is specified,
<span class="samp">--convert-links</span> is ignored, so <span class="samp">.orig</span> files are simply not
created in the first place.

     <p><a name="index-conversion-of-links-114"></a><a name="index-link-conversion-115"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">-k</span><dt><span class="samp">--convert-links</span><dd>After the download is complete, convert the links in the document to
make them suitable for local viewing.  This affects not only the visible
hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to external content,
such as embedded images, links to style sheets, hyperlinks to non-<span class="sc">html</span>
content, etc.

     <p>Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:

          <ul>
<li>The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be changed to
refer to the file they point to as a relative link.

          <p>Example: if the downloaded file <span class="file">/foo/doc.html</span> links to
<span class="file">/bar/img.gif</span>, also downloaded, then the link in <span class="file">doc.html</span>
will be modified to point to <span class="samp">../bar/img.gif</span>.  This kind of
transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of directories.

          <li>The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be changed
to include host name and absolute path of the location they point to.

          <p>Example: if the downloaded file <span class="file">/foo/doc.html</span> links to
<span class="file">/bar/img.gif</span> (or to <span class="file">../bar/img.gif</span>), then the link in
<span class="file">doc.html</span> will be modified to point to
<span class="file">http://</span><var>hostname</var><span class="file">/bar/img.gif</span>. 
</ul>

     <p>Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file was
downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was not
downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address rather than
presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former links are converted
to relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to
another directory.

     <p>Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links have
been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by <span class="samp">-k</span> will be
performed at the end of all the downloads.

     <p><a name="index-backing-up-converted-files-116"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">-K</span><dt><span class="samp">--backup-converted</span><dd>When converting a file, back up the original version with a <span class="samp">.orig</span>
suffix.  Affects the behavior of <span class="samp">-N</span> (see <a href="#HTTP-Time_002dStamping-Internals">HTTP Time-Stamping Internals</a>).

     <br><dt><span class="samp">-m</span><dt><span class="samp">--mirror</span><dd>Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on recursion
and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and keeps <span class="sc">ftp</span>
directory listings.  It is currently equivalent to
<span class="samp">-r -N -l inf --no-remove-listing</span>.

     <p><a name="index-page-requisites-117"></a><a name="index-required-images_002c-downloading-118"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">-p</span><dt><span class="samp">--page-requisites</span><dd>This option causes Wget to download all the files that are necessary to
properly display a given <span class="sc">html</span> page.  This includes such things as
inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.

     <p>Ordinarily, when downloading a single <span class="sc">html</span> page, any requisite documents
that may be needed to display it properly are not downloaded.  Using
<span class="samp">-r</span> together with <span class="samp">-l</span> can help, but since Wget does not
ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined documents, one is
generally left with &ldquo;leaf documents&rdquo; that are missing their
requisites.

     <p>For instance, say document <span class="file">1.html</span> contains an <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code> tag
referencing <span class="file">1.gif</span> and an <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> tag pointing to external
document <span class="file">2.html</span>.  Say that <span class="file">2.html</span> is similar but that its
image is <span class="file">2.gif</span> and it links to <span class="file">3.html</span>.  Say this
continues up to some arbitrarily high number.

     <p>If one executes the command:

     <pre class="example">          wget -r -l 2 http://<var>site</var>/1.html
     </pre>
     <p>then <span class="file">1.html</span>, <span class="file">1.gif</span>, <span class="file">2.html</span>, <span class="file">2.gif</span>, and
<span class="file">3.html</span> will be downloaded.  As you can see, <span class="file">3.html</span> is
without its requisite <span class="file">3.gif</span> because Wget is simply counting the
number of hops (up to 2) away from <span class="file">1.html</span> in order to determine
where to stop the recursion.  However, with this command:

     <pre class="example">          wget -r -l 2 -p http://<var>site</var>/1.html
     </pre>
     <p>all the above files <em>and</em> <span class="file">3.html</span>'s requisite <span class="file">3.gif</span>
will be downloaded.  Similarly,

     <pre class="example">          wget -r -l 1 -p http://<var>site</var>/1.html
     </pre>
     <p>will cause <span class="file">1.html</span>, <span class="file">1.gif</span>, <span class="file">2.html</span>, and <span class="file">2.gif</span>
to be downloaded.  One might think that:

     <pre class="example">          wget -r -l 0 -p http://<var>site</var>/1.html
     </pre>
     <p>would download just <span class="file">1.html</span> and <span class="file">1.gif</span>, but unfortunately
this is not the case, because <span class="samp">-l 0</span> is equivalent to
<span class="samp">-l inf</span>&mdash;that is, infinite recursion.  To download a single <span class="sc">html</span>
page (or a handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a
<span class="samp">-i</span> <span class="sc">url</span> input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off
<span class="samp">-r</span> and <span class="samp">-l</span>:

     <pre class="example">          wget -p http://<var>site</var>/1.html
     </pre>
     <p>Note that Wget will behave as if <span class="samp">-r</span> had been specified, but only
that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links from that
page to external documents will not be followed.  Actually, to download
a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist on separate
websites), and make sure the lot displays properly locally, this author
likes to use a few options in addition to <span class="samp">-p</span>:

     <pre class="example">          wget -E -H -k -K -p http://<var>site</var>/<var>document</var>
     </pre>
     <p>To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea of an
external document link is any URL specified in an <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> tag, an
<code>&lt;AREA&gt;</code> tag, or a <code>&lt;LINK&gt;</code> tag other than <code>&lt;LINK
REL="stylesheet"&gt;</code>.

     <p><a name="index-_0040sc_007bhtml_007d-comments-119"></a><a name="index-comments_002c-_0040sc_007bhtml_007d-120"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">--strict-comments</span><dd>Turn on strict parsing of <span class="sc">html</span> comments.  The default is to terminate
comments at the first occurrence of <span class="samp">--&gt;</span>.

     <p>According to specifications, <span class="sc">html</span> comments are expressed as <span class="sc">sgml</span>
<dfn>declarations</dfn>.  Declaration is special markup that begins with
<span class="samp">&lt;!</span> and ends with <span class="samp">&gt;</span>, such as <span class="samp">&lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt;</span>, that
may contain comments between a pair of <span class="samp">--</span> delimiters.  <span class="sc">html</span>
comments are &ldquo;empty declarations&rdquo;, <span class="sc">sgml</span> declarations without any
non-comment text.  Therefore, <span class="samp">&lt;!--foo--&gt;</span> is a valid comment, and
so is <span class="samp">&lt;!--one-- --two--&gt;</span>, but <span class="samp">&lt;!--1--2--&gt;</span> is not.

     <p>On the other hand, most <span class="sc">html</span> writers don't perceive comments as anything
other than text delimited with <span class="samp">&lt;!--</span> and <span class="samp">--&gt;</span>, which is not
quite the same.  For example, something like <span class="samp">&lt;!------------&gt;</span>
works as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a multiple
of four (!).  If not, the comment technically lasts until the next
<span class="samp">--</span>, which may be at the other end of the document.  Because of
this, many popular browsers completely ignore the specification and
implement what users have come to expect: comments delimited with
<span class="samp">&lt;!--</span> and <span class="samp">--&gt;</span>.

     <p>Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which resulted in
missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in browsers, but had
the misfortune of containing non-compliant comments.  Beginning with
version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks of clients that implements
&ldquo;naive&rdquo; comments, terminating each comment at the first occurrence of
<span class="samp">--&gt;</span>.

     <p>If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this
option to turn it on.

     <p>However, the author of this option came across a page with tags like
<code>&lt;LINK REL="home" HREF="/"&gt;</code> and came to the realization that
specifying tags to ignore was not enough.  One can't just tell Wget to
ignore <code>&lt;LINK&gt;</code>, because then stylesheets will not be downloaded. 
Now the best bet for downloading a single page and its requisites is the
dedicated <span class="samp">--page-requisites</span> option.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Recursive Download</h2>

<p><a name="index-recursion-125"></a><a name="index-retrieving-126"></a><a name="index-recursive-download-127"></a>
GNU Wget is capable of traversing parts of the Web (or a single
<span class="sc">http</span> or <span class="sc">ftp</span> server), following links and directory structure. 
We refer to this as to <dfn>recursive retrieval</dfn>, or <dfn>recursion</dfn>.

   <p>With <span class="sc">http</span> <span class="sc">url</span>s, Wget retrieves and parses the <span class="sc">html</span> from
the given <span class="sc">url</span>, documents, retrieving the files the <span class="sc">html</span>
document was referring to, through markup like <code>href</code>, or
<code>src</code>.  If the freshly downloaded file is also of type
<code>text/html</code> or <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, it will be parsed and
followed further.

   <p>Recursive retrieval of <span class="sc">http</span> and <span class="sc">html</span> content is
<dfn>breadth-first</dfn>.  This means that Wget first downloads the requested
<span class="sc">html</span> document, then the documents linked from that document, then the
documents linked by them, and so on.  In other words, Wget first
downloads the documents at depth 1, then those at depth 2, and so on
until the specified maximum depth.

   <p>The maximum <dfn>depth</dfn> to which the retrieval may descend is specified
with the <span class="samp">-l</span> option.  The default maximum depth is five layers.

   <p>When retrieving an <span class="sc">ftp</span> <span class="sc">url</span> recursively, Wget will retrieve all
the data from the given directory tree (including the subdirectories up
to the specified depth) on the remote server, creating its mirror image
locally.  <span class="sc">ftp</span> retrieval is also limited by the <code>depth</code>
parameter.  Unlike <span class="sc">http</span> recursion, <span class="sc">ftp</span> recursion is performed
depth-first.

   <p>By default, Wget will create a local directory tree, corresponding to
the one found on the remote server.

   <p>Recursive retrieving can find a number of applications, the most
important of which is mirroring.  It is also useful for <span class="sc">www</span>
presentations, and any other opportunities where slow network
connections should be bypassed by storing the files locally.

   <p>You should be warned that recursive downloads can overload the remote
servers.  Because of that, many administrators frown upon them and may
ban access from your site if they detect very fast downloads of big
amounts of content.  When downloading from Internet servers, consider
using the <span class="samp">-w</span> option to introduce a delay between accesses to the
server.  The download will take a while longer, but the server
administrator will not be alarmed by your rudeness.

   <p>Of course, recursive download may cause problems on your machine.  If
left to run unchecked, it can easily fill up the disk.  If downloading
from local network, it can also take bandwidth on the system, as well as
consume memory and CPU.

   <p>Try to specify the criteria that match the kind of download you are
trying to achieve.  If you want to download only one page, use
<span class="samp">--page-requisites</span> without any additional recursion.  If you want
to download things under one directory, use <span class="samp">-np</span> to avoid
downloading things from other directories.  If you want to download all
the files from one directory, use <span class="samp">-l 1</span> to make sure the recursion
depth never exceeds one.  See <a href="#Following-Links">Following Links</a>, for more information
about this.

   <p>Recursive retrieval should be used with care.  Don't say you were not
warned.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Following Links</h2>

<p><a name="index-links-128"></a><a name="index-following-links-129"></a>
When retrieving recursively, one does not wish to retrieve loads of
unnecessary data.  Most of the time the users bear in mind exactly what
they want to download, and want Wget to follow only specific links.

   <p>For example, if you wish to download the music archive from
<span class="samp">fly.srk.fer.hr</span>, you will not want to download all the home pages
that happen to be referenced by an obscure part of the archive.

   <p>Wget possesses several mechanisms that allows you to fine-tune which
links it will follow.

<h3 class="section">4.1 Spanning Hosts</h3>

<p><a name="index-spanning-hosts-130"></a><a name="index-hosts_002c-spanning-131"></a>
Wget's recursive retrieval normally refuses to visit hosts different
than the one you specified on the command line.  This is a reasonable
default; without it, every retrieval would have the potential to turn
your Wget into a small version of google.

   <p>However, visiting different hosts, or <dfn>host spanning,</dfn> is sometimes
a useful option.  Maybe the images are served from a different server. 
Maybe you're mirroring a site that consists of pages interlinked between
three servers.  Maybe the server has two equivalent names, and the <span class="sc">html</span>
pages refer to both interchangeably.

     <dl>
<dt>Span to any host&mdash;<span class="samp">-H</span><dd>
The <span class="samp">-H</span> option turns on host spanning, thus allowing Wget's
recursive run to visit any host referenced by a link.  Unless sufficient
recursion-limiting criteria are applied depth, these foreign hosts will
typically link to yet more hosts, and so on until Wget ends up sucking
up much more data than you have intended.

     <br><dt>Limit spanning to certain domains&mdash;<span class="samp">-D</span><dd>
The <span class="samp">-D</span> option allows you to specify the domains that will be
followed, thus limiting the recursion only to the hosts that belong to
these domains.  Obviously, this makes sense only in conjunction with
<span class="samp">-H</span>.  A typical example would be downloading the contents of
<span class="samp">www.server.com</span>, but allowing downloads from
<span class="samp">images.server.com</span>, etc.:

     <pre class="example">          wget -rH -Dserver.com http://www.server.com/
     </pre>
     <p>You can specify more than one address by separating them with a comma,
e.g. <span class="samp">-Ddomain1.com,domain2.com</span>.

     <br><dt>Keep download off certain domains&mdash;<span class="samp">--exclude-domains</span><dd>
If there are domains you want to exclude specifically, you can do it
with <span class="samp">--exclude-domains</span>, which accepts the same type of arguments
of <span class="samp">-D</span>, but will <em>exclude</em> all the listed domains.  For
example, if you want to download all the hosts from <span class="samp">foo.edu</span>
domain, with the exception of <span class="samp">sunsite.foo.edu</span>, you can do it like
this:

     <pre class="example">          wget -rH -Dfoo.edu --exclude-domains sunsite.foo.edu \
              http://www.foo.edu/
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">4.2 Types of Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-types-of-files-132"></a>
When downloading material from the web, you will often want to restrict
the retrieval to only certain file types.  For example, if you are
interested in downloading <span class="sc">gif</span>s, you will not be overjoyed to get
loads of PostScript documents, and vice versa.

   <p>Wget offers two options to deal with this problem.  Each option
description lists a short name, a long name, and the equivalent command
in <span class="file">.wgetrc</span>.

   <p><a name="index-accept-wildcards-133"></a><a name="index-accept-suffixes-134"></a><a name="index-wildcards_002c-accept-135"></a><a name="index-suffixes_002c-accept-136"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">-A </span><var>acclist</var><dt><span class="samp">--accept </span><var>acclist</var><dt><span class="samp">accept = </span><var>acclist</var><dd>The argument to <span class="samp">--accept</span> option is a list of file suffixes or
patterns that Wget will download during recursive retrieval.  A suffix
is the ending part of a file, and consists of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; letters,
e.g. <span class="samp">gif</span> or <span class="samp">.jpg</span>.  A matching pattern contains shell-like
wildcards, e.g. <span class="samp">books*</span> or <span class="samp">zelazny*196[0-9]*</span>.

     <p>So, specifying <span class="samp">wget -A gif,jpg</span> will make Wget download only the
files ending with <span class="samp">gif</span> or <span class="samp">jpg</span>, i.e. <span class="sc">gif</span>s and
<span class="sc">jpeg</span>s.  On the other hand, <span class="samp">wget -A "zelazny*196[0-9]*"</span> will
download only files beginning with <span class="samp">zelazny</span> and containing numbers
from 1960 to 1969 anywhere within.  Look up the manual of your shell for
a description of how pattern matching works.

     <p>Of course, any number of suffixes and patterns can be combined into a
comma-separated list, and given as an argument to <span class="samp">-A</span>.

     <p><a name="index-reject-wildcards-137"></a><a name="index-reject-suffixes-138"></a><a name="index-wildcards_002c-reject-139"></a><a name="index-suffixes_002c-reject-140"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">-R </span><var>rejlist</var><dt><span class="samp">--reject </span><var>rejlist</var><dt><span class="samp">reject = </span><var>rejlist</var><dd>The <span class="samp">--reject</span> option works the same way as <span class="samp">--accept</span>, only
its logic is the reverse; Wget will download all files <em>except</em> the
ones matching the suffixes (or patterns) in the list.

     <p>So, if you want to download a whole page except for the cumbersome
<span class="sc">mpeg</span>s and <span class="sc">.au</span> files, you can use <span class="samp">wget -R mpg,mpeg,au</span>. 
Analogously, to download all files except the ones beginning with
<span class="samp">bjork</span>, use <span class="samp">wget -R "bjork*"</span>.  The quotes are to prevent
expansion by the shell. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">The <span class="samp">-A</span> and <span class="samp">-R</span> options may be combined to achieve even
better fine-tuning of which files to retrieve.  E.g. <span class="samp">wget -A
"*zelazny*" -R .ps</span> will download all the files having <span class="samp">zelazny</span> as
a part of their name, but <em>not</em> the PostScript files.

   <p>Note that these two options do not affect the downloading of <span class="sc">html</span>
files (as determined by a <span class="samp">.htm</span> or <span class="samp">.html</span> filename
prefix). This behavior may not be desirable for all users, and may be
changed for future versions of Wget.

   <p>Note, too, that query strings (strings at the end of a URL beginning
with a question mark (<span class="samp">?</span>) are not included as part of the
filename for accept/reject rules, even though these will actually
contribute to the name chosen for the local file. It is expected that
a future version of Wget will provide an option to allow matching
against query strings.

   <p>Finally, it's worth noting that the accept/reject lists are matched
<em>twice</em> against downloaded files: once against the URL's filename
portion, to determine if the file should be downloaded in the first
place; then, after it has been accepted and successfully downloaded,
the local file's name is also checked against the accept/reject lists
to see if it should be removed. The rationale was that, since
<span class="samp">.htm</span> and <span class="samp">.html</span> files are always downloaded regardless of
accept/reject rules, they should be removed <em>after</em> being
downloaded and scanned for links, if they did match the accept/reject
lists. However, this can lead to unexpected results, since the local
filenames can differ from the original URL filenames in the following
ways, all of which can change whether an accept/reject rule matches:

     <ul>
<li>If the local file already exists and <span class="samp">--no-directories</span> was
specified, a numeric suffix will be appended to the original name. 
<li>If <span class="samp">--html-extension</span> was specified, the local filename will have
<span class="samp">.html</span> appended to it. If Wget is invoked with <span class="samp">-E -A.php</span>,
a filename such as <span class="samp">index.php</span> will match be accepted, but upon
download will be named <span class="samp">index.php.html</span>, which no longer matches,
and so the file will be deleted. 
<li>Query strings do not contribute to URL matching, but are included in
local filenames, and so <em>do</em> contribute to filename matching. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">This behavior, too, is considered less-than-desirable, and may change
in a future version of Wget.

<h3 class="section">4.3 Directory-Based Limits</h3>

<p><a name="index-directories-141"></a><a name="index-directory-limits-142"></a>
Regardless of other link-following facilities, it is often useful to
place the restriction of what files to retrieve based on the directories
those files are placed in.  There can be many reasons for this&mdash;the
home pages may be organized in a reasonable directory structure; or some
directories may contain useless information, e.g. <span class="file">/cgi-bin</span> or
<span class="file">/dev</span> directories.

   <p>Wget offers three different options to deal with this requirement.  Each
option description lists a short name, a long name, and the equivalent
command in <span class="file">.wgetrc</span>.

   <p><a name="index-directories_002c-include-143"></a><a name="index-include-directories-144"></a><a name="index-accept-directories-145"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">-I </span><var>list</var><dt><span class="samp">--include </span><var>list</var><dt><span class="samp">include_directories = </span><var>list</var><dd><span class="samp">-I</span> option accepts a comma-separated list of directories included
in the retrieval.  Any other directories will simply be ignored.  The
directories are absolute paths.

     <p>So, if you wish to download from <span class="samp">http://host/people/bozo/</span>
following only links to bozo's colleagues in the <span class="file">/people</span>
directory and the bogus scripts in <span class="file">/cgi-bin</span>, you can specify:

     <pre class="example">          wget -I /people,/cgi-bin http://host/people/bozo/
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-directories_002c-exclude-146"></a><a name="index-exclude-directories-147"></a><a name="index-reject-directories-148"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">-X </span><var>list</var><dt><span class="samp">--exclude </span><var>list</var><dt><span class="samp">exclude_directories = </span><var>list</var><dd><span class="samp">-X</span> option is exactly the reverse of <span class="samp">-I</span>&mdash;this is a list of
directories <em>excluded</em> from the download.  E.g. if you do not want
Wget to download things from <span class="file">/cgi-bin</span> directory, specify <span class="samp">-X
/cgi-bin</span> on the command line.

     <p>The same as with <span class="samp">-A</span>/<span class="samp">-R</span>, these two options can be combined
to get a better fine-tuning of downloading subdirectories.  E.g. if you
want to load all the files from <span class="file">/pub</span> hierarchy except for
<span class="file">/pub/worthless</span>, specify <span class="samp">-I/pub -X/pub/worthless</span>.

     <p><a name="index-no-parent-149"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">-np</span><dt><span class="samp">--no-parent</span><dt><span class="samp">no_parent = on</span><dd>The simplest, and often very useful way of limiting directories is
disallowing retrieval of the links that refer to the hierarchy
<dfn>above</dfn> than the beginning directory, i.e. disallowing ascent to the
parent directory/directories.

     <p>The <span class="samp">--no-parent</span> option (short <span class="samp">-np</span>) is useful in this case. 
Using it guarantees that you will never leave the existing hierarchy. 
Supposing you issue Wget with:

     <pre class="example">          wget -r --no-parent http://somehost/~luzer/my-archive/
     </pre>
     <p>You may rest assured that none of the references to
<span class="file">/~his-girls-homepage/</span> or <span class="file">/~luzer/all-my-mpegs/</span> will be
followed.  Only the archive you are interested in will be downloaded. 
Essentially, <span class="samp">--no-parent</span> is similar to
<span class="samp">-I/~luzer/my-archive</span>, only it handles redirections in a more
intelligent fashion.

     <p><strong>Note</strong> that, for HTTP (and HTTPS), the trailing slash is very
important to <span class="samp">--no-parent</span>. HTTP has no concept of a &ldquo;directory&rdquo;&mdash;Wget
relies on you to indicate what's a directory and what isn't. In
<span class="samp">http://foo/bar/</span>, Wget will consider <span class="samp">bar</span> to be a
directory, while in <span class="samp">http://foo/bar</span> (no trailing slash),
<span class="samp">bar</span> will be considered a filename (so <span class="samp">--no-parent</span> would be
meaningless, as its parent is <span class="samp">/</span>).

<h3 class="section">4.4 Relative Links</h3>

<p><a name="index-relative-links-150"></a>
When <span class="samp">-L</span> is turned on, only the relative links are ever followed. 
Relative links are here defined those that do not refer to the web
server root.  For example, these links are relative:

<pre class="example">     &lt;a href="foo.gif"&gt;
     &lt;a href="foo/bar.gif"&gt;
     &lt;a href="../foo/bar.gif"&gt;
</pre>
   <p>These links are not relative:

<pre class="example">     &lt;a href="/foo.gif"&gt;
     &lt;a href="/foo/bar.gif"&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.server.com/foo/bar.gif"&gt;
</pre>
   <p>Using this option guarantees that recursive retrieval will not span
hosts, even without <span class="samp">-H</span>.  In simple cases it also allows downloads
to &ldquo;just work&rdquo; without having to convert links.

   <p>This option is probably not very useful and might be removed in a future
release.

<h3 class="section">4.5 Following FTP Links</h3>

<p><a name="index-following-ftp-links-151"></a>
The rules for <span class="sc">ftp</span> are somewhat specific, as it is necessary for
them to be.  <span class="sc">ftp</span> links in <span class="sc">html</span> documents are often included
for purposes of reference, and it is often inconvenient to download them
by default.

   <p>To have <span class="sc">ftp</span> links followed from <span class="sc">html</span> documents, you need to
specify the <span class="samp">--follow-ftp</span> option.  Having done that, <span class="sc">ftp</span>
links will span hosts regardless of <span class="samp">-H</span> setting.  This is logical,
as <span class="sc">ftp</span> links rarely point to the same host where the <span class="sc">http</span>
server resides.  For similar reasons, the <span class="samp">-L</span> options has no
effect on such downloads.  On the other hand, domain acceptance
(<span class="samp">-D</span>) and suffix rules (<span class="samp">-A</span> and <span class="samp">-R</span>) apply normally.

   <p>Also note that followed links to <span class="sc">ftp</span> directories will not be
retrieved recursively further.

One of the most important aspects of mirroring information from the
Internet is updating your archives.

   <p>Downloading the whole archive again and again, just to replace a few
changed files is expensive, both in terms of wasted bandwidth and money,
and the time to do the update.  This is why all the mirroring tools
offer the option of incremental updating.

   <p>Such an updating mechanism means that the remote server is scanned in
search of <dfn>new</dfn> files.  Only those new files will be downloaded in
the place of the old ones.

   <p>A file is considered new if one of these two conditions are met:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>A file of that name does not already exist locally.

     <li>A file of that name does exist, but the remote file was modified more
recently than the local file.
        </ol>

   <p>To implement this, the program needs to be aware of the time of last
modification of both local and remote files.  We call this information the
<dfn>time-stamp</dfn> of a file.

   <p>The time-stamping in GNU Wget is turned on using <span class="samp">--timestamping</span>
(<span class="samp">-N</span>) option, or through <code>timestamping = on</code> directive in
<span class="file">.wgetrc</span>.  With this option, for each file it intends to download,
Wget will check whether a local file of the same name exists.  If it
does, and the remote file is older, Wget will not download it.

   <p>If the local file does not exist, or the sizes of the files do not
match, Wget will download the remote file no matter what the time-stamps
say.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Time-Stamping Usage</h3>

<p><a name="index-time_002dstamping-usage-156"></a><a name="index-usage_002c-time_002dstamping-157"></a>
The usage of time-stamping is simple.  Say you would like to download a
file so that it keeps its date of modification.

<pre class="example">     wget -S http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/
</pre>
   <p>A simple <code>ls -l</code> shows that the time stamp on the local file equals
the state of the <code>Last-Modified</code> header, as returned by the server. 
As you can see, the time-stamping info is preserved locally, even
without <span class="samp">-N</span> (at least for <span class="sc">http</span>).

   <p>Several days later, you would like Wget to check if the remote file has
changed, and download it if it has.

<pre class="example">     wget -N http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/
</pre>
   <p>Wget will ask the server for the last-modified date.  If the local file
has the same timestamp as the server, or a newer one, the remote file
will not be re-fetched.  However, if the remote file is more recent,
Wget will proceed to fetch it.

   <p>The same goes for <span class="sc">ftp</span>.  For example:

<pre class="example">     wget "ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/emacs/gnus/*"
</pre>
   <p>(The quotes around that URL are to prevent the shell from trying to
interpret the <span class="samp">*</span>.)

   <p>After download, a local directory listing will show that the timestamps
match those on the remote server.  Reissuing the command with <span class="samp">-N</span>
will make Wget re-fetch <em>only</em> the files that have been modified
since the last download.

   <p>If you wished to mirror the GNU archive every week, you would use a
command like the following, weekly:

<pre class="example">     wget --timestamping -r ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/
</pre>
   <p>Note that time-stamping will only work for files for which the server
gives a timestamp.  For <span class="sc">http</span>, this depends on getting a
<code>Last-Modified</code> header.  For <span class="sc">ftp</span>, this depends on getting a
directory listing with dates in a format that Wget can parse
(see <a href="#FTP-Time_002dStamping-Internals">FTP Time-Stamping Internals</a>).

<h3 class="section">5.2 HTTP Time-Stamping Internals</h3>

<p><a name="index-http-time_002dstamping-158"></a>
Time-stamping in <span class="sc">http</span> is implemented by checking of the
<code>Last-Modified</code> header.  If you wish to retrieve the file
<span class="file">foo.html</span> through <span class="sc">http</span>, Wget will check whether
<span class="file">foo.html</span> exists locally.  If it doesn't, <span class="file">foo.html</span> will be
retrieved unconditionally.

   <p>If the file does exist locally, Wget will first check its local
time-stamp (similar to the way <code>ls -l</code> checks it), and then send a
<code>HEAD</code> request to the remote server, demanding the information on
the remote file.

   <p>The <code>Last-Modified</code> header is examined to find which file was
modified more recently (which makes it &ldquo;newer&rdquo;).  If the remote file
is newer, it will be downloaded; if it is older, Wget will give
up.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

   <p>When <span class="samp">--backup-converted</span> (<span class="samp">-K</span>) is specified in conjunction
with <span class="samp">-N</span>, server file <var>X</var> is compared to local file
<var>X</var><span class="samp">.orig</span>, if extant, rather than being compared to local file
<var>X</var>, which will always differ if it's been converted by
<span class="samp">--convert-links</span> (<span class="samp">-k</span>).

   <p>Arguably, <span class="sc">http</span> time-stamping should be implemented using the
<code>If-Modified-Since</code> request.

<h3 class="section">5.3 FTP Time-Stamping Internals</h3>

<p><a name="index-ftp-time_002dstamping-159"></a>
In theory, <span class="sc">ftp</span> time-stamping works much the same as <span class="sc">http</span>, only
<span class="sc">ftp</span> has no headers&mdash;time-stamps must be ferreted out of directory
listings.

   <p>If an <span class="sc">ftp</span> download is recursive or uses globbing, Wget will use the
<span class="sc">ftp</span> <code>LIST</code> command to get a file listing for the directory
containing the desired file(s).  It will try to analyze the listing,
treating it like Unix <code>ls -l</code> output, extracting the time-stamps. 
The rest is exactly the same as for <span class="sc">http</span>.  Note that when
retrieving individual files from an <span class="sc">ftp</span> server without using
globbing or recursion, listing files will not be downloaded (and thus
files will not be time-stamped) unless <span class="samp">-N</span> is specified.

   <p>Assumption that every directory listing is a Unix-style listing may
sound extremely constraining, but in practice it is not, as many
non-Unix <span class="sc">ftp</span> servers use the Unixoid listing format because most
(all?) of the clients understand it.  Bear in mind that <span class="sc">rfc959</span>
defines no standard way to get a file list, let alone the time-stamps. 
We can only hope that a future standard will define this.

   <p>Another non-standard solution includes the use of <code>MDTM</code> command
that is supported by some <span class="sc">ftp</span> servers (including the popular
<code>wu-ftpd</code>), which returns the exact time of the specified file. 
Wget may support this command in the future.

Once you know how to change default settings of Wget through command
line arguments, you may wish to make some of those settings permanent. 
You can do that in a convenient way by creating the Wget startup
file&mdash;<span class="file">.wgetrc</span>.

   <p>Besides <span class="file">.wgetrc</span> is the &ldquo;main&rdquo; initialization file, it is
convenient to have a special facility for storing passwords.  Thus Wget
reads and interprets the contents of <span class="file">$HOME/.netrc</span>, if it finds
it.  You can find <span class="file">.netrc</span> format in your system manuals.

   <p>Wget reads <span class="file">.wgetrc</span> upon startup, recognizing a limited set of
commands.

<h3 class="section">6.1 Wgetrc Location</h3>

<p><a name="index-wgetrc-location-165"></a><a name="index-location-of-wgetrc-166"></a>
When initializing, Wget will look for a <dfn>global</dfn> startup file,
<span class="file">/usr/local/etc/wgetrc</span> by default (or some prefix other than
<span class="file">/usr/local</span>, if Wget was not installed there) and read commands
from there, if it exists.

   <p>Then it will look for the user's file.  If the environmental variable
<code>WGETRC</code> is set, Wget will try to load that file.  Failing that, no
further attempts will be made.

   <p>If <code>WGETRC</code> is not set, Wget will try to load <span class="file">$HOME/.wgetrc</span>.

   <p>The fact that user's settings are loaded after the system-wide ones
means that in case of collision user's wgetrc <em>overrides</em> the
system-wide wgetrc (in <span class="file">/usr/local/etc/wgetrc</span> by default).

<h3 class="section">6.2 Wgetrc Syntax</h3>

<p><a name="index-wgetrc-syntax-167"></a><a name="index-syntax-of-wgetrc-168"></a>
The syntax of a wgetrc command is simple:

<pre class="example">     variable = value
</pre>
   <p>The <dfn>variable</dfn> will also be called <dfn>command</dfn>.  Valid
<dfn>values</dfn> are different for different commands.

   <p>The commands are case-insensitive and underscore-insensitive.  Thus
<span class="samp">DIr__PrefiX</span> is the same as <span class="samp">dirprefix</span>.  Empty lines, lines
beginning with <span class="samp">#</span> and lines containing white-space only are
discarded.

   <p>Commands that expect a comma-separated list will clear the list on an
empty command.  So, if you wish to reset the rejection list specified in
global <span class="file">wgetrc</span>, you can do it with:

<pre class="example">     reject =

<h3 class="section">6.3 Wgetrc Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-wgetrc-commands-169"></a>
The complete set of commands is listed below.  Legal values are listed
after the <span class="samp">=</span>.  Simple Boolean values can be set or unset using
<span class="samp">on</span> and <span class="samp">off</span> or <span class="samp">1</span> and <span class="samp">0</span>.

   <p>Some commands take pseudo-arbitrary values.  <var>address</var> values can be
hostnames or dotted-quad IP addresses.  <var>n</var> can be any positive
integer, or <span class="samp">inf</span> for infinity, where appropriate.  <var>string</var>
values can be any non-empty string.

   <p>Most of these commands have direct command-line equivalents.  Also, any
wgetrc command can be specified on the command line using the
<span class="samp">--execute</span> switch (see <a href="#Basic-Startup-Options">Basic Startup Options</a>.)

<h3 class="section">6.4 Sample Wgetrc</h3>

<p><a name="index-sample-wgetrc-170"></a>
This is the sample initialization file, as given in the distribution. 
It is divided in two section&mdash;one for global usage (suitable for global
startup file), and one for local usage (suitable for
<span class="file">$HOME/.wgetrc</span>).  Be careful about the things you change.

   <p>Note that almost all the lines are commented out.  For a command to have
any effect, you must remove the <span class="samp">#</span> character at the beginning of
its line.

<pre class="example">     ###
     ### Sample Wget initialization file .wgetrc
     ###
     
     ## You can use this file to change the default behaviour of wget or to
     ## avoid having to type many many command-line options. This file does
     ## not contain a comprehensive list of commands -- look at the manual
     ## to find out what you can put into this file.
     ##
     ## Wget initialization file can reside in /usr/local/etc/wgetrc
     ## (global, for all users) or $HOME/.wgetrc (for a single user).
     ##
     ## To use the settings in this file, you will have to uncomment them,
     ## as well as change them, in most cases, as the values on the
     ## commented-out lines are the default values (e.g. "off").
     
     
     ##
     ## Global settings (useful for setting up in /usr/local/etc/wgetrc).
     ## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
     ## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:
     ##
     
     # You can set retrieve quota for beginners by specifying a value
     # optionally followed by 'K' (kilobytes) or 'M' (megabytes).  The
     # default quota is unlimited.
     #quota = inf
     
     # You can lower (or raise) the default number of retries when
     # downloading a file (default is 20).
     #tries = 20
     
     # Lowering the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval is handy to
     # prevent newbies from going too "deep" when they unwittingly start
     # the recursive retrieval.  The default is 5.
     #reclevel = 5
     
     # By default Wget uses "passive FTP" transfer where the client
     # initiates the data connection to the server rather than the other
     # way around.  That is required on systems behind NAT where the client
     # computer cannot be easily reached from the Internet.  However, some
     # firewalls software explicitly supports active FTP and in fact has
     # problems supporting passive transfer.  If you are in such
     # environment, use "passive_ftp = off" to revert to active FTP.
     #passive_ftp = off
     
     # The "wait" command below makes Wget wait between every connection.
     # If, instead, you want Wget to wait only between retries of failed
     # downloads, set waitretry to maximum number of seconds to wait (Wget
     # will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first failure
     # on a file, 2 seconds after the second failure, etc. up to this max).
     waitretry = 10
     
     
     ##
     ## Local settings (for a user to set in his $HOME/.wgetrc).  It is
     ## *highly* undesirable to put these settings in the global file, since
     ## they are potentially dangerous to "normal" users.
     ##
     ## Even when setting up your own ~/.wgetrc, you should know what you
     ## are doing before doing so.
     ##
     
     # Set this to on to use timestamping by default:
     #timestamping = off
     
     # It is a good idea to make Wget send your email address in a `From:'
     # header with your request (so that server administrators can contact
     # you in case of errors).  Wget does *not* send `From:' by default.
     #header = From: Your Name &lt;username@site.domain&gt;
     
     # You can set up other headers, like Accept-Language.  Accept-Language
     # is *not* sent by default.
     #header = Accept-Language: en
     
     # You can set the default proxies for Wget to use for http and ftp.
     # They will override the value in the environment.
     #http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
     #ftp_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
     
     # If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.
     #use_proxy = on
     
     # You can customize the retrieval outlook.  Valid options are default,
     # binary, mega and micro.
     #dot_style = default
     
     # Setting this to off makes Wget not download /robots.txt.  Be sure to
     # know *exactly* what /robots.txt is and how it is used before changing
     # the default!
     #robots = on
     
     # It can be useful to make Wget wait between connections.  Set this to
     # the number of seconds you want Wget to wait.
     #wait = 0
     
     # You can force creating directory structure, even if a single is being
     # retrieved, by setting this to on.
     #dirstruct = off
     
     # You can turn on recursive retrieving by default (don't do this if
     # you are not sure you know what it means) by setting this to on.
     #recursive = off
     
     # To always back up file X as X.orig before converting its links (due
     # to -k / --convert-links / convert_links = on having been specified),
     # set this variable to on:
     #backup_converted = off
     
     # To have Wget follow FTP links from HTML files by default, set this

<h3 class="section">7.1 Simple Usage</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Say you want to download a <span class="sc">url</span>.  Just type:

     <pre class="example">          wget http://fly.srk.fer.hr/
     </pre>
     <li>But what will happen if the connection is slow, and the file is lengthy? 
The connection will probably fail before the whole file is retrieved,
more than once.  In this case, Wget will try getting the file until it
either gets the whole of it, or exceeds the default number of retries
(this being 20).  It is easy to change the number of tries to 45, to
insure that the whole file will arrive safely:

     <pre class="example">          wget --tries=45 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg
     </pre>
     <li>Now let's leave Wget to work in the background, and write its progress
to log file <span class="file">log</span>.  It is tiring to type <span class="samp">--tries</span>, so we
shall use <span class="samp">-t</span>.

     <pre class="example">          wget -t 45 -o log http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg &amp;
     </pre>
     <p>The ampersand at the end of the line makes sure that Wget works in the
background.  To unlimit the number of retries, use <span class="samp">-t inf</span>.

     <li>The usage of <span class="sc">ftp</span> is as simple.  Wget will take care of login and
password.

     <pre class="example">          wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/welcome.msg
     </pre>
     <li>If you specify a directory, Wget will retrieve the directory listing,
parse it and convert it to <span class="sc">html</span>.  Try:

     <pre class="example">          wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/
          links index.html
     </pre>
     </ul>

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Examples">Examples</a>
<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">7.2 Advanced Usage</h3>

     <ul>
<li>You have a file that contains the URLs you want to download?  Use the
<span class="samp">-i</span> switch:

     <pre class="example">          wget -i <var>file</var>
     </pre>
     <p>If you specify <span class="samp">-</span> as file name, the <span class="sc">url</span>s will be read from
standard input.

     <li>Create a five levels deep mirror image of the GNU web site, with the
same directory structure the original has, with only one try per
document, saving the log of the activities to <span class="file">gnulog</span>:

     <pre class="example">          wget -r http://www.gnu.org/ -o gnulog
     </pre>
     <li>The same as the above, but convert the links in the <span class="sc">html</span> files to
point to local files, so you can view the documents off-line:

     <pre class="example">          wget --convert-links -r http://www.gnu.org/ -o gnulog
     </pre>
     <li>Retrieve only one <span class="sc">html</span> page, but make sure that all the elements needed
for the page to be displayed, such as inline images and external style
sheets, are also downloaded.  Also make sure the downloaded page
references the downloaded links.

     <pre class="example">          wget -p --convert-links http://www.server.com/dir/page.html
     </pre>
     <p>The <span class="sc">html</span> page will be saved to <span class="file">www.server.com/dir/page.html</span>, and
the images, stylesheets, etc., somewhere under <span class="file">www.server.com/</span>,
depending on where they were on the remote server.

     <li>The same as the above, but without the <span class="file">www.server.com/</span> directory. 
In fact, I don't want to have all those random server directories
anyway&mdash;just save <em>all</em> those files under a <span class="file">download/</span>
subdirectory of the current directory.

     <pre class="example">          wget -p --convert-links -nH -nd -Pdownload \
               http://www.server.com/dir/page.html
     </pre>
     <li>Retrieve the index.html of <span class="samp">www.lycos.com</span>, showing the original
server headers:

     <pre class="example">          wget -S http://www.lycos.com/
     </pre>
     <li>Save the server headers with the file, perhaps for post-processing.

     <pre class="example">          wget --save-headers http://www.lycos.com/
          more index.html
     </pre>
     <li>Retrieve the first two levels of <span class="samp">wuarchive.wustl.edu</span>, saving them
to <span class="file">/tmp</span>.

     <pre class="example">          wget -r -l2 -P/tmp ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/
     </pre>
     <li>You want to download all the <span class="sc">gif</span>s from a directory on an <span class="sc">http</span>
server.  You tried <span class="samp">wget http://www.server.com/dir/*.gif</span>, but that
didn't work because <span class="sc">http</span> retrieval does not support globbing.  In
that case, use:

     <pre class="example">          wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.gif http://www.server.com/dir/
     </pre>
     <p>More verbose, but the effect is the same.  <span class="samp">-r -l1</span> means to
retrieve recursively (see <a href="#Recursive-Download">Recursive Download</a>), with maximum depth
of 1.  <span class="samp">--no-parent</span> means that references to the parent directory
are ignored (see <a href="#Directory_002dBased-Limits">Directory-Based Limits</a>), and <span class="samp">-A.gif</span> means to
download only the <span class="sc">gif</span> files.  <span class="samp">-A "*.gif"</span> would have worked
too.

     <li>Suppose you were in the middle of downloading, when Wget was
interrupted.  Now you do not want to clobber the files already present. 
It would be:

     <pre class="example">          wget -nc -r http://www.gnu.org/
     </pre>
     <li>If you want to encode your own username and password to <span class="sc">http</span> or
<span class="sc">ftp</span>, use the appropriate <span class="sc">url</span> syntax (see <a href="#URL-Format">URL Format</a>).

     <pre class="example">          wget ftp://hniksic:mypassword@unix.server.com/.emacs
     </pre>
     <p>Note, however, that this usage is not advisable on multi-user systems
because it reveals your password to anyone who looks at the output of
<code>ps</code>.

     <p><a name="index-redirecting-output-172"></a><li>You would like the output documents to go to standard output instead of
to files?

     <pre class="example">          wget -O - http://jagor.srce.hr/ http://www.srce.hr/
     </pre>
     <p>You can also combine the two options and make pipelines to retrieve the
documents from remote hotlists:

     <pre class="example">          wget -O - http://cool.list.com/ | wget --force-html -i -
     </pre>
     </ul>

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">7.3 Very Advanced Usage</h3>

<p><a name="index-mirroring-173"></a>
     <ul>
<li>If you wish Wget to keep a mirror of a page (or <span class="sc">ftp</span>
subdirectories), use <span class="samp">--mirror</span> (<span class="samp">-m</span>), which is the shorthand
for <span class="samp">-r -l inf -N</span>.  You can put Wget in the crontab file asking it
to recheck a site each Sunday:

     <pre class="example">          crontab
          0 0 * * 0 wget --mirror http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog
     </pre>
     <li>In addition to the above, you want the links to be converted for local
viewing.  But, after having read this manual, you know that link
conversion doesn't play well with timestamping, so you also want Wget to
back up the original <span class="sc">html</span> files before the conversion.  Wget invocation
would look like this:

     <pre class="example">          wget --mirror --convert-links --backup-converted  \
               http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog
     </pre>
     <li>But you've also noticed that local viewing doesn't work all that well
when <span class="sc">html</span> files are saved under extensions other than <span class="samp">.html</span>,
perhaps because they were served as <span class="file">index.cgi</span>.  So you'd like
Wget to rename all the files served with content-type <span class="samp">text/html</span>
or <span class="samp">application/xhtml+xml</span> to <var>name</var><span class="file">.html</span>.

     <pre class="example">          wget --mirror --convert-links --backup-converted \
               --html-extension -o /home/me/weeklog        \
               http://www.gnu.org/
     </pre>
     <p>Or, with less typing:

     <pre class="example">          wget -m -k -K -E http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog
     </pre>
     </ul>

<h3 class="section">8.1 Proxies</h3>

<p><a name="index-proxies-175"></a>
<dfn>Proxies</dfn> are special-purpose <span class="sc">http</span> servers designed to transfer
data from remote servers to local clients.  One typical use of proxies
is lightening network load for users behind a slow connection.  This is
achieved by channeling all <span class="sc">http</span> and <span class="sc">ftp</span> requests through the
proxy which caches the transferred data.  When a cached resource is
requested again, proxy will return the data from cache.  Another use for
proxies is for companies that separate (for security reasons) their
internal networks from the rest of Internet.  In order to obtain
information from the Web, their users connect and retrieve remote data
using an authorized proxy.

   <p>Wget supports proxies for both <span class="sc">http</span> and <span class="sc">ftp</span> retrievals.  The
standard way to specify proxy location, which Wget recognizes, is using
the following environment variables:

     <dl>
<dt><code>http_proxy</code><dt><code>https_proxy</code><dd>If set, the <code>http_proxy</code> and <code>https_proxy</code> variables should
contain the <span class="sc">url</span>s of the proxies for <span class="sc">http</span> and <span class="sc">https</span>
connections respectively.

     <br><dt><code>ftp_proxy</code><dd>This variable should contain the <span class="sc">url</span> of the proxy for <span class="sc">ftp</span>
connections.  It is quite common that <code>http_proxy</code> and
<code>ftp_proxy</code> are set to the same <span class="sc">url</span>.

     <br><dt><code>no_proxy</code><dd>This variable should contain a comma-separated list of domain extensions
proxy should <em>not</em> be used for.  For instance, if the value of
<code>no_proxy</code> is <span class="samp">.mit.edu</span>, proxy will not be used to retrieve
documents from MIT. 
</dl>

   <p>In addition to the environment variables, proxy location and settings
may be specified from within Wget itself.

     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">--no-proxy</span><dt><span class="samp">proxy = on/off</span><dd>This option and the corresponding command may be used to suppress the
use of proxy, even if the appropriate environment variables are set.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">http_proxy = </span><var>URL</var><dt><span class="samp">https_proxy = </span><var>URL</var><dt><span class="samp">ftp_proxy = </span><var>URL</var><dt><span class="samp">no_proxy = </span><var>string</var><dd>These startup file variables allow you to override the proxy settings
specified by the environment. 
</dl>

   <p>Some proxy servers require authorization to enable you to use them.  The
authorization consists of <dfn>username</dfn> and <dfn>password</dfn>, which must
be sent by Wget.  As with <span class="sc">http</span> authorization, several
authentication schemes exist.  For proxy authorization only the
<code>Basic</code> authentication scheme is currently implemented.

   <p>You may specify your username and password either through the proxy
<span class="sc">url</span> or through the command-line options.  Assuming that the
company's proxy is located at <span class="samp">proxy.company.com</span> at port 8001, a
proxy <span class="sc">url</span> location containing authorization data might look like
this:

<pre class="example">     http://hniksic:mypassword@proxy.company.com:8001/
</pre>
   <p>Alternatively, you may use the <span class="samp">proxy-user</span> and
<span class="samp">proxy-password</span> options, and the equivalent <span class="file">.wgetrc</span>
settings <code>proxy_user</code> and <code>proxy_password</code> to set the proxy
username and password.

<h3 class="section">8.6 Reporting Bugs</h3>

<p><a name="index-bugs-183"></a><a name="index-reporting-bugs-184"></a><a name="index-bug-reports-185"></a>
<!-- man begin BUGS -->
You are welcome to submit bug reports via the GNU Wget bug tracker (see
<a href="http://wget.addictivecode.org/BugTracker">http://wget.addictivecode.org/BugTracker</a>).

   <p>Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a bug.  If
Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave as documented,
it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not sure about the way
they are supposed to work, it might well be a bug, but you might want to
double-check the documentation and the mailing lists (see <a href="#Mailing-List">Mailing List</a>).

     <li>Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.  E.g. if
Wget crashes while downloading <span class="samp">wget -rl0 -kKE -t5 --no-proxy
http://yoyodyne.com -o /tmp/log</span>, you should try to see if the crash is
repeatable, and if will occur with a simpler set of options.  You might
even try to start the download at the page where the crash occurred to
see if that page somehow triggered the crash.

     <p>Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of your
<span class="file">.wgetrc</span> file, just dumping it into the debug message is probably
a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the bug repeats
with <span class="file">.wgetrc</span> moved out of the way.  Only if it turns out that
<span class="file">.wgetrc</span> settings affect the bug, mail me the relevant parts of
the file.

     <li>Please start Wget with <span class="samp">-d</span> option and send us the resulting
output (or relevant parts thereof).  If Wget was compiled without
debug support, recompile it&mdash;it is <em>much</em> easier to trace bugs
with debug support on.

     <p>Note: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive information
from the debug log before sending it to the bug address.  The
<code>-d</code> won't go out of its way to collect sensitive information,
but the log <em>will</em> contain a fairly complete transcript of Wget's
communication with the server, which may include passwords and pieces
of downloaded data.  Since the bug address is publically archived, you
may assume that all bug reports are visible to the public.

     <li>If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. <code>gdb `which
wget` core</code> and type <code>where</code> to get the backtrace.  This may not
work if the system administrator has disabled core files, but it is
safe to try.
        </ol>

<h3 class="section">8.7 Portability</h3>

<p><a name="index-portability-186"></a><a name="index-operating-systems-187"></a>
Like all GNU software, Wget works on the GNU system.  However, since it
uses GNU Autoconf for building and configuring, and mostly avoids using
&ldquo;special&rdquo; features of any particular Unix, it should compile (and
work) on all common Unix flavors.

   <p>Various Wget versions have been compiled and tested under many kinds of
Unix systems, including GNU/Linux, Solaris, SunOS 4.x, Mac OS X, OSF
(aka Digital Unix or Tru64), Ultrix, *BSD, IRIX, AIX, and others.  Some
of those systems are no longer in widespread use and may not be able to
support recent versions of Wget.  If Wget fails to compile on your
system, we would like to know about it.

   <p>Thanks to kind contributors, this version of Wget compiles and works
on 32-bit Microsoft Windows platforms.  It has been compiled
successfully using MS Visual C++ 6.0, Watcom, Borland C, and GCC
compilers.  Naturally, it is crippled of some features available on
Unix, but it should work as a substitute for people stuck with
Windows.  Note that Windows-specific portions of Wget are not
guaranteed to be supported in the future, although this has been the
case in practice for many years now.  All questions and problems in
Windows usage should be reported to Wget mailing list at
<a href="mailto:wget@sunsite.dk">wget@sunsite.dk</a> where the volunteers who maintain the
Windows-related features might look at them.

   <p>Support for building on MS-DOS via DJGPP has been contributed by Gisle
Vanem; a port to VMS is maintained by Steven Schweda, and is available
at <a href="http://antinode.org/">http://antinode.org/</a>.

<h3 class="section">8.8 Signals</h3>

<p><a name="index-signal-handling-188"></a><a name="index-hangup-189"></a>
Since the purpose of Wget is background work, it catches the hangup
signal (<code>SIGHUP</code>) and ignores it.  If the output was on standard
output, it will be redirected to a file named <span class="file">wget-log</span>. 
Otherwise, <code>SIGHUP</code> is ignored.  This is convenient when you wish
to redirect the output of Wget after having started it.

<pre class="example">     $ wget http://www.gnus.org/dist/gnus.tar.gz &amp;
     ...
     $ kill -HUP %%
     SIGHUP received, redirecting output to `wget-log'.
</pre>
   <p>Other than that, Wget will not try to interfere with signals in any way. 
<kbd>C-c</kbd>, <code>kill -TERM</code> and <code>kill -KILL</code> should kill it alike.

<h3 class="section">9.1 Robot Exclusion</h3>

<p><a name="index-robot-exclusion-190"></a><a name="index-robots_002etxt-191"></a><a name="index-server-maintenance-192"></a>
It is extremely easy to make Wget wander aimlessly around a web site,
sucking all the available data in progress.  <span class="samp">wget -r </span><var>site</var>,
and you're set.  Great?  Not for the server admin.

   <p>As long as Wget is only retrieving static pages, and doing it at a
reasonable rate (see the <span class="samp">--wait</span> option), there's not much of a
problem.  The trouble is that Wget can't tell the difference between the
smallest static page and the most demanding CGI.  A site I know has a
section handled by a CGI Perl script that converts Info files to <span class="sc">html</span> on
the fly.  The script is slow, but works well enough for human users
viewing an occasional Info file.  However, when someone's recursive Wget
download stumbles upon the index page that links to all the Info files
through the script, the system is brought to its knees without providing
anything useful to the user (This task of converting Info files could be
done locally and access to Info documentation for all installed GNU
software on a system is available from the <code>info</code> command).

   <p>To avoid this kind of accident, as well as to preserve privacy for
documents that need to be protected from well-behaved robots, the
concept of <dfn>robot exclusion</dfn> was invented.  The idea is that
the server administrators and document authors can specify which
portions of the site they wish to protect from robots and those
they will permit access.

   <p>The most popular mechanism, and the <i>de facto</i> standard supported by
all the major robots, is the &ldquo;Robots Exclusion Standard&rdquo; (RES) written
by Martijn Koster et al. in 1994.  It specifies the format of a text
file containing directives that instruct the robots which URL paths to
avoid.  To be found by the robots, the specifications must be placed in
<span class="file">/robots.txt</span> in the server root, which the robots are expected to
download and parse.

   <p>Although Wget is not a web robot in the strictest sense of the word, it
can downloads large parts of the site without the user's intervention to
download an individual page.  Because of that, Wget honors RES when
downloading recursively.  For instance, when you issue:

<pre class="example">     wget -r http://www.server.com/
</pre>
   <p>First the index of <span class="samp">www.server.com</span> will be downloaded.  If Wget
finds that it wants to download more documents from that server, it will
request <span class="samp">http://www.server.com/robots.txt</span> and, if found, use it
for further downloads.  <span class="file">robots.txt</span> is loaded only once per each
server.

   <p>Until version 1.8, Wget supported the first version of the standard,
written by Martijn Koster in 1994 and available at
<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html">http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html</a>.  As of version 1.8,
Wget has supported the additional directives specified in the internet
draft <span class="samp">&lt;draft-koster-robots-00.txt&gt;</span> titled &ldquo;A Method for Web
Robots Control&rdquo;.  The draft, which has as far as I know never made to
an <span class="sc">rfc</span>, is available at
<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots-rfc.txt">http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots-rfc.txt</a>.

   <p>This manual no longer includes the text of the Robot Exclusion Standard.

   <p>The second, less known mechanism, enables the author of an individual
document to specify whether they want the links from the file to be
followed by a robot.  This is achieved using the <code>META</code> tag, like
this:

<pre class="example">     &lt;meta name="robots" content="nofollow"&gt;
</pre>
   <p>This is explained in some detail at
<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/meta-user.html">http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/meta-user.html</a>.  Wget supports this
method of robot exclusion in addition to the usual <span class="file">/robots.txt</span>
exclusion.

   <p>If you know what you are doing and really really wish to turn off the
robot exclusion, set the <code>robots</code> variable to <span class="samp">off</span> in your
<span class="file">.wgetrc</span>.  You can achieve the same effect from the command line
using the <code>-e</code> switch, e.g. <span class="samp">wget -e robots=off </span><var>url</var><span class="samp">...</span>.

<h3 class="section">9.2 Security Considerations</h3>

<p><a name="index-security-193"></a>
When using Wget, you must be aware that it sends unencrypted passwords
through the network, which may present a security problem.  Here are the
main issues, and some solutions.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The passwords on the command line are visible using <code>ps</code>.  The best
way around it is to use <code>wget -i -</code> and feed the <span class="sc">url</span>s to
Wget's standard input, each on a separate line, terminated by <kbd>C-d</kbd>. 
Another workaround is to use <span class="file">.netrc</span> to store passwords; however,
storing unencrypted passwords is also considered a security risk.

     <li>Using the insecure <dfn>basic</dfn> authentication scheme, unencrypted
passwords are transmitted through the network routers and gateways.

     <li>The <span class="sc">ftp</span> passwords are also in no way encrypted.  There is no good
solution for this at the moment.

     <li>Although the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; output of Wget tries to hide the passwords,
debugging logs show them, in all forms.  This problem is avoided by
being careful when you send debug logs (yes, even when you send them to
me).

<p><a name="index-contributors-194"></a>
GNU Wget was written by Hrvoje Niksic <a href="mailto:hniksic@xemacs.org">hniksic@xemacs.org</a>,
and it is currently maintained by Micah Cowan <a href="mailto:micah@cowan.name">micah@cowan.name</a>.

   <p>However, the development of Wget could never have gone as far as it has, were
it not for the help of many people, either with bug reports, feature proposals,
patches, or letters saying &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo;.

   <p>Special thanks goes to the following people (no particular order):

     <ul>
<li>Dan Harkless&mdash;contributed a lot of code and documentation of
extremely high quality, as well as the <code>--page-requisites</code> and
related options.  He was the principal maintainer for some time and
released Wget 1.6.

     <li>Ian Abbott&mdash;contributed bug fixes, Windows-related fixes, and
provided a prototype implementation of the breadth-first recursive
download.  Co-maintained Wget during the 1.8 release cycle.

     <li>The dotsrc.org crew, in particular Karsten Thygesen&mdash;donated system
resources such as the mailing list, web space, <span class="sc">ftp</span> space, and
version control repositories, along with a lot of time to make these
actually work.  Christian Reiniger was of invaluable help with setting
up Subversion.

     <li>Heiko Herold&mdash;provided high-quality Windows builds and contributed
bug and build reports for many years.

     <li>Shawn McHorse&mdash;bug reports and patches.

     <li>Kaveh R. Ghazi&mdash;on-the-fly <code>ansi2knr</code>-ization.  Lots of
portability fixes.

     <li>Gordon Matzigkeit&mdash;<span class="file">.netrc</span> support.

     <li>Zlatko Calusic, Tomislav Vujec and Drazen Kacar&mdash;feature suggestions
and &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; discussions.

     <li>Darko Budor&mdash;initial port to Windows.

     <li>Antonio Rosella&mdash;help and suggestions, plus the initial Italian
translation.

     <li>Tomislav Petrovic, Mario Mikocevic&mdash;many bug reports and suggestions.

     <li>Francois Pinard&mdash;many thorough bug reports and discussions.

     <li>Karl Eichwalder&mdash;lots of help with internationalization, Makefile
layout and many other things.

     <li>Junio Hamano&mdash;donated support for Opie and <span class="sc">http</span> <code>Digest</code>
authentication.

     <li>Mauro Tortonesi&mdash;Improved IPv6 support, adding support for dual
family systems.  Refactored and enhanced FTP IPv6 code. Maintained GNU
Wget from 2004&ndash;2008.

     <li>Christopher G. Lewis&mdash;Maintenance of the Windows version of GNU WGet.

     <li>Gisle Vanem&mdash;Many helpful patches and improvements, especially for
Windows and MS-DOS support.

     <li>People who provided donations for development&mdash;including Brian Gough. 
</ul>

   <p>The following people have provided patches, bug/build reports, useful

<p><a name="index-FDL_002c-GNU-Free-Documentation-License-195"></a><div align="center">Version 1.2, November 2002</div>

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with...Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
