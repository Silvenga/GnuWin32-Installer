What is here?
=============

The following directories exist:

book                 binary book files for Crafty.  At the least,
                     you need a book.bin.  Most likely you will want
                     a books.bin and bookc.bin (the crafty documentation
                     explains their purpose).
documentation        Documentation files.  There is a postscript version (.ps),
                     a pure ASCII version (.ascii) and a groff version that
                     can be used to produce any sort of output file you want.
executables          these are windows executable files, that should run on
                     most any processor around.  You can often compile the
                     source yourself and optimize it for your specific hardware
                     to get a faster executable.
pgn                  PGN files that can be used to produce a larger or smaller
                     book.bin.  Beware as "enormous.pgn" is just that. :)
source               Here you will find all the source files.  Note that 
                     version 20.11 is more recent than version 20.8.  The 
                     xx.y version is set so that larger y is more current, not
                     treating it as a decimal number.
TB                   3-4-5 piece endgame databases (Nalimov format)
wccc.2005            log files from the 2005 WCCC tournament produced by Crafty
                     on the 8-cpu Opteron box.
wccc.2006            log files from the 2006 WCCC tournament produced by Crafty
                     on the 8-cpu Opteron box.

What do I need to download?
===========================

1.  You need a copy of the documentation.  While crafty is easy to run, and
has some built-in help facilities, the documentation will help you learn how
to use all the features the program has.

2.  You need a copy of Crafty.  Source is the best bet, but if you don't feel
comfortable compiling your own executable, look in the executables directory and
grab the version you want.  Note that even if you choose to download a ready-
to-run version, downloading the source to go with it is a good idea as that will
get you the "audio" stuff if you want crafty to verbally announce moves, etc.

3.  You need at least a book.bin file from the book directory.  If you are going
to play computer vs computer matches, you will want a bookc.bin, and the
books.bin is useful to prevent it from playing ridiculous openings.

4.  You may or may not want to download the 3-4-5 piece endgame tables.  They
total to about 7.5 gigabytes of storage, so they require a lot of disk space
as well as download bandwidth.

Put everything in one directory, except for the endgame tables (if you download
them) which should be put in a sub-directory named "TB" (until you learn how to
put them somewhere else by reading over the crafty.doc information).

You are set.

Which version do I download?
============================

Currently 20.x is the most recent, and it is certainly the strongest Crafty
version to date.  The highest .x number is the most current, and should be the
best, but on occasion this is not the case due to bugs.

What's next?
============

Read through the crafty.doc information.  It explains everything from how to
create custom books, to using multiple-CPU machines, and so forth.  Then join
the crafty mailing list (crafty-list@cis.uab.edu) and participate in the
discussions there, get your questions answered, and so forth.

see you there.
