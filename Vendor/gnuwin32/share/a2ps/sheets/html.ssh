style HTML is

version is 1.1
requires a2ps 4.12a

documentation is
  "This style is meant to pretty print HTML source files, not to simulate"
  "its interpretation (i.e., samp(<bold>foo</bold>)samp does not print samp(foo)samp"
  "in bold).  If you really meant to print the result of the HTML file"
  "emph(interpreted)emph, then you should turn the delegations on, and make sure"
  "samp(a2ps)samp has HTML delegations."
end documentation

operators in Keyword_strong are
  (/<([^>]*)>/ "<", \1, ">")
end operators

sequences are
  # HTML comments
  "<!--" Comment "-->",

  # Tags with arguments (E.g., <a>, <img>, <table>...)
  (/<([[:alpha:]]+) / "<" Keyword_strong, \1 Keyword_strong, " " Plain) Keyword ">" Keyword_strong
    # Exceptions are double-quoted strings inside tags
    exceptions are
        (/"(([^"]|\\\\.)*)"/ "\"" Plain, \1 String, "\"" Plain)
    end exceptions
