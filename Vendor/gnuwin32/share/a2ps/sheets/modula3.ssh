   "the late 1980s at Digital Equipment Corporation and Olivetti, Modula-3"
   "corrects many of the deficiencies of Pascal and Modula-2 for practical"
   "software engineering. In particular, Modula-3 keeps the simplicity of"
   "type safety of the earlier languages, while providing new facilities"
   "for exception handling, concurrency, object-oriented programming, and"
   "automatic garbage collection. Modula-3 is both a practical"
