## Macros to define obsolete macros.  ##
## ---------------------------------- ##


# AU_DEFINE(NAME, CODE)
# ---------------------
# Define the macro NAME so that it expand to CODE only when
# autoupdate is running.  This is achieved with traces in
# autoupdate itself, so this macro expands to nothing.
#
m4_define([AU_DEFINE], [])

# AU_DEFUN(NAME, NEW-CODE, [MESSAGE])
# -----------------------------------
# Declare that the macro NAME is now obsoleted, and should be replaced
# by NEW-CODE.  Tell the user she should run autoupdate, and when
# autoupdate is run, emit MESSAGE as a warning and include it in
# the updated configure.ac file.
#
# Also define NAME as a macro which code is NEW-CODE.
#
# This allows sharing the same code for both supporting obsoleted macros,
# and to update a configure.ac.
# See the end of `autoupdate.in' for a longer description.
m4_define([AU_DEFUN],
[# This is what autoupdate's m4 run will expand.  It fires
# the warning (with _au_warn_XXX), outputs it into the
# updated configure.ac (with AC_DIAGNOSE), and then outputs
# the replacement expansion.
AU_DEFINE([$1],
[m4_ifval([$3], [_au_warn_$1([$3])AC_DIAGNOSE([obsolete], [$3])d[]nl
])dnl
$2])

# This is an auxiliary macro that is also run when
# autoupdate runs m4.  It simply calls m4_warning, but
# we need a wrapper so that each warning is emitted only
# once.  We break the quoting in m4_warning's argument in
# order to expand this macro's arguments, not AU_DEFUN's.
AU_DEFINE([_au_warn_$1],
[m4_warning($][@)dnl
m4_define([_au_warn_$1], [])])

# Finally, this is the expansion that is picked up by
# autoconf.  It tells the user to run autoupdate, and
# then outputs the replacement expansion.  We do not care
# about autoupdate's warning because that contains
# information on what to do *after* running autoupdate.
AC_DEFUN([$1],
	 [AC_DIAGNOSE([obsolete], [The macro `$1' is obsolete.
You should run autoupdate.])dnl
$2])])


# AU_ALIAS(OLD-NAME, NEW-NAME)
# ----------------------------
# The OLD-NAME is no longer used, just use NEW-NAME instead.  There is
# little difference with using AU_DEFUN but the fact there is little
# interest in running the test suite on both OLD-NAME and NEW-NAME.
# This macro makes it possible to distinguish such cases.
#
# Do not use `defn' since then autoupdate would replace an old macro
# call with the new macro body instead of the new macro call.
#
# Moreover, we have to take care that calls without parameters are
# expanded to calls without parameters, not with one empty parameter.
# This is not only an aesthetical improvement of autoupdate, it also
# matters with poorly written macros which test for $# = 0.
#
m4_define([AU_ALIAS],
[AU_DEFUN([$1], _AU_ALIAS_BODY([$], [$2]))])

# The body for the AU_DEFUN above should look like:
#	[m4_if($#, 0, [NEW-NAME], [NEW-NAME($@)])]
# Thus the helper macro is:
m4_define([_AU_ALIAS_BODY], [[m4_if($1#, 0, [$2], [$2($1@)])]])
