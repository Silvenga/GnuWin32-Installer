# AC_CONFIG_TESTDIR(TEST-DIRECTORY, [AUTOTEST-PATH = TEST-DIRECTORY])
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configure an Autotest test suite directory.  Invoke it once per dir,
# even if there are several test suites in there.
#
# AUTOTEST-PATH must help the test suite to find the executables.
# It is relative to the top level of the package, and is expanded
# into all the build dirs of AUTOTEST-PATH, then all the src dirs.
#
# Do not use _ACEOF as we are being dumped into config.status via
# an _ACEOF-heredoc.
