NAME
    asec - inverse trigonometric secant

SYNOPSIS
    asec(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		real, with absolute value >= 1
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the asec of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    v = asec(x) is the number in [0, pi] for which sec(v) = x.

EXAMPLE
    > print asec(2, 1e-5), asec(2, 1e-10), asec(2, 1e-15), asec(2, 1e-20)

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qasec(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)
