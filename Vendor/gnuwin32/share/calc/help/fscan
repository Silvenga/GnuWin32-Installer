NAME
   fscan - scan a file for possible assignment to variables

SYNOPSIS
   fscan(fs, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)

TYPES
    fs			file stream open for reading
    x_1, x_2, ...	any

    return		integer

DESCRIPTION
   Starting at the current position on fs and while values remain in the
   x_i arguments, fields of non-whitespace characters are read and evaluated
   in succession and if the corresponding x_i is an lvalue, the value of
   the field is assigned to x_i.  Scanning ceases when no x_i remain or
   when the stream reaches end-of-file.

   The function returns the number of fields evaluated.

EXAMPLE
    > global a, b, c, d;
    > f = fopen("/tmp/junk", "w+");
    > fputs(f, "\t3+4\t\ta-2i  d=a^2   'word'")
    > rewind(f)
    > fscan(f, a, b, , c)
	4
    > print a, b, c, d
    7 a-2i word 49
