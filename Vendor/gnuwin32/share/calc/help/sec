NAME
    sec - trigonometric secant function

SYNOPSIS
    sec(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		real
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the secant of x to a multiple of eps, with error less
    in absolute value than .75 * eps.

EXAMPLE
    > print sec(1, 1e-5), sec(1, 1e-10), sec(1, 1e-15), sec(1, 1e-20)
    1.85082 1.8508157177 1.850815717680926 1.85081571768092561791

LIMITS
    unlike sin and cos, x must be real
    eps > 0

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qsec(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)

SEE ALSO
    sin, cos, tan, csc, cot, epsilon
