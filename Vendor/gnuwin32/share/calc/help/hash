NAME
    hash - return the calc hash value

SYNOPSIS
    hash(x_1 [, x_2, x_3, ...])

TYPES
    x_1, x_1, ...	any

    return		integer v, 0 <= v < 2^32

DESCRIPTION
    Returns a hash value for one or more values of arbitrary types.

    The calc hash value is based on the core Fowler/Noll/Vo hash
    known as FNV-1.  The return value, however, cannot be used
    as an FNV hash value because calc's internal function also
    takes into account more abstract concepts such as data types.

    See:

    information about the Fowler/Noll/Vo (FNV) hash.

EXAMPLE
    > a = isqrt(2e1000); s = "xyz";
    > hash(a,s)
	    2378490456

LIMITS
    The number of arguments is not to exceed 100.

LINK LIBRARY
    none
