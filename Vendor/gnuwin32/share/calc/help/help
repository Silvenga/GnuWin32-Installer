You can also ask for help on a particular function name.  For example,

    help asinh
    help round

or on a particular symbol such as:

    help =

For example:

    help usage

will print the calc command usage information.	One can obtain calc help
without invoking any startup code by running calc as follows:

    calc -q help topic

where 'topic' is one of the topics listed above.

If the -m mode disallows opening files for reading or execution of programs,
then the help facility will be disabled.  See:

    help usage

for details of the -m mode.

The help command is able to display installed help files for custom builtin
functions.  However, if the custom name is the same as a standard help
file, the standard help file will be displayed instead.	 The custom help
builtin should be used to directly access the custom help file.

For example, the custom help builtin has the same name as the standard
help file.  That is:

    help help

will print this file only.  However the custom help builtin will print
only the custom builtin help file:

    custom("help", "help");

will by-pass a standard help file and look for the custom version directly.

As a hack, the following:

     help custhelp/anything

as the same effect as:

    custom("help", "anything");
