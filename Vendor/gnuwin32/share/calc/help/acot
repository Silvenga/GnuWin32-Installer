NAME
    acot - inverse trigonometric cotangent

SYNOPSIS
    acot(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		real
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the acot of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    v = acot(x) is the number in (0, pi) for which cot(v) = x.

EXAMPLE
    > print acot(2, 1e-5),  acot(2, 1e-10), acot(2, 1e-15), acot(2, 1e-20)
    .46365 .463647609 .463647609000806 .46364760900080611621

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
