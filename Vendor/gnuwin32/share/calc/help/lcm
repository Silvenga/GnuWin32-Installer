    x1, x2, ... rational number

    return	rational number

DESCRIPTION
    Compute the least common multiple of one or more rational numbers.

    If no xi is zero, lcm(x1, x2, ...) is the least positive number v
    for which v is a multiple of each xi.  If at least one xi is zero,
    the lcm is zero.

EXAMPLE
    > print lcm(12, -24, 30), lcm(9/10, 11/5, 4/25), lcm(2)
