NAME
    errmax - return or set maximum error-count before execution stops

SYNOPSIS
    errmax([num])

TYPES
    num		integer

    return	integer

DESCRIPTION
    Without an argument, errmax() returns the current value of an
    internal variable errmax.  Calling errmax(num) returns this value
    but then resets its value to num.  Execution is aborted if
    evaluation of an error value if this makes errcount > errmax.
    An error message displays the errno for the error.

EXAMPLE
    > errmax(2)
	0
    > errcount()
	0
    > a = 1/0; b = 2 + ""; c = error(27); d = newerror("alpha");
    Error 27 caused errcount to exceed errmax

    > print c, d
    0 0

    Here global variables c and d were created when compiling the line
    but execution was aborted before the intended assignments to c and d.

LIMITS
    0 <= num < 2^32

LINK LIBRARY
    none
