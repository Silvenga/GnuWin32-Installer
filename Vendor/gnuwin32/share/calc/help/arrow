SYMBOL and NAME
    ->	- arrow operator

SYNOPSIS
    p -> X

TYPES
    p		pointer to an lvalue
    X		identifier

    return	lvalue

DESCRIPTION
    p->X returns the same as (*p).X.  Thus the current value of *p is
    to be an object of a type for which X identifies one element.
    p->X then returns the lvalue corresponding to that element of the
    value of *p.

    The expression *p.X will cause a runtime error since this is
    interpreted as *(p.X) in which p is expected to be an object of
    an appropriate type.

    Spaces or tabs on either side of -> are optional.

EXAMPLES
    > obj pair {one, two}
    > obj pair A, B
    > p = &A
    > p->one = 1; p->two = 2
    > A
	    obj pair {1, 2}

    > A->two = &B
    > p->two->one = 3; p->two->two = 4

    > *p->ptwo
	    obj pair {3, 4}

    > B = {5,6}
    > *p->two
	    obj pair {5, 6}
