NAME
    lfactor - smallest prime factor in first specified number of primes

SYNOPSIS
    lfactor(n, m)

TYPES
    n		integer
    m		nonnegative integer <= 203280221 (= number of primes < 2^32)

    return	positive integer

DESCRIPTION
    If n >= 0 and n has a prime factor in the first m primes,
    lfactor(n, m) returns the smallest such factor.

    If n < 0, -1 is returned.

EXAMPLE
    > print lfactor(35,2), lfactor(35,3), lfactor(-35, 3)
    1 5 -1

    > print lfactor(2^32+1,115), lfactor(2^32+1,116), lfactor(2^59-1,1e5)
    1 641 179951

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qlowfactor(NUMBER *n, NUMBER *count)
    FULL zlowfactor(ZVALUE z, long count)
