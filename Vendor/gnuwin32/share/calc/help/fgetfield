NAME
    fgetfield - read the next word from a file

SYNOPSIS
    fgetfield(fs)

TYPES
    fs		file stream open for reading

    return	string, null or error value

DESCRIPTION
    If characters cannot be read from the file, an error value is returned.

    Otherwise starting at the current file position, any whitespace
    characters are skipped.  If the reading reaches end-of-file, the
    null value is returned.  If non-whitespace is encountered, formation
    of a string begins, continuing until whitespace of '\0' or end-of-file
    is reached.	 The returned value is this string (terminated as usual
    by a null character).  After the operation, the file position will
    be immediately after the first whitespace character of '\0' or at
    end-of-file.

EXAMPLE

    > f = fopen("/tmp/junk", "w")
    > fputs(f, " Alpha Beta \n")
    > freopen(f, "r")
    > fgetfield(f)
	"Alpha"
    > fgetfield(f)
	"Beta"
    > fgetfield(f)
    >
    > freopen(f, "w")
    > fputstr(f, " Alpha  ", "Beta")
    > freopen(f, "r")
    > fgetfield(f)
	"Alpha"
    > fgetfield(f)
	""
    > fgetfield(f)
	"Beta"
