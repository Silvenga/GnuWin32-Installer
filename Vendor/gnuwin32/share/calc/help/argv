NAME
    argv - count or value of a calc command line supplied argument

SYNOPSIS
    argv([n])

TYPES
    n		nonnegative integer

    return	any

DESCRIPTION
    Without args, this builtin returns the number of calc command line
    strings available.

    If the numeric arg is supplied, then the corresponding command line
    string is return, if it exists.  Otherwise a nul() value is returned.

    In keeping with the argc/argv convention of C, argv(0) will refer
    to the 1st argv string, and argv(argv()-1) will refer to the last.
    This differs from the way the param() builtin works.

    By default, calc will evaluate all of its command line arguments.
    However, if calc is invoked with -s, all non-dashed options will
    be left as unevaluated strings.  Thus:

	calc -i 2+2

    will cause calc to print 4 and enter interactive mode.  In this case
    argv() will return 0.

    On the other hand:

	calc -i -s 2+2

    will cause calc to interactive mode.  The argv() builtin will return 1
    and argv(0) will return the string "2+2".

EXAMPLE
    $ calc -s a bb ccc
    > argc = argv();
    > for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) print "argv[": i : '] = "': argv(i) : '"';
    argv[0] = "a"
    argv[1] = "bb"
    argv[2] = "ccc"

LIMITS
    0 <= n < 2^31

LINK LIBRARY
    none
