Calc's relationship to the GNU Lesser General Public License
------------------------------------------------------------

    In section 0 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, one finds
    the following definition:

	The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or
	work which has been distributed under these terms.

    Calc is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License.

    In the same section 0, one also find the following:

	For a library, complete source code means all the source code
	for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
	definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
	and installation of the library.

    There are at least two calc binary link libraries found in calc:

	libcalc.a	libcustcalc.a

    Clearly all files that go into the creation of those binary link
    libraries are covered under the License.

    The ``scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
    of the library'' include:

	* Makefiles
	* source files created by the Makefiles
	* source code used in the creation of intermediate source files

     All of those files are covered under the License.

     The ``associated interface definition files'' are those files that:

	* show how the calc binary link libraries are used
	* test the validity of the binary link libraries
	* document routines found in the binary link libraries
	* show how one can interactively use the binary link libraries

     Calc provides an extensive set of files that perform the above
     functions.

	* files under the sample sub-directory
	* files under the help sub-directory
	* files under the lib sub-directory
	* the main calc.c file

     The ``complete source code'' includes ALL files shipped with calc,
     except for the exception files explicitly listed in the ``Calc
     copyrights and exception files'' section below.

Why calc did not use the GNU General Public License
---------------------------------------------------

    It has been suggested that one should consider using the GNU General
    Public License instead of the GNU Lesser General Public License:

	http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html

    As you can read in the above URL, there are times where a library
    cannot give free software any particular advantage.	 One of those
    times is when there is significantly similar versions available
    that are not covered under a Copyleft such as the GNU General Public
    License.

    The reason why calc was placed under the GNU Lesser General Public
    License is because for many years (1984 thru 1999), calc was offered
    without any form of Copyleft.  At the time calc was placed under
    the GNU Lesser General Public License, a number of systems and
    distributions distributed calc without a Copyleft.
