NAME
    freestatics - free memory used for static variables

SYNOPSIS
    freestatics()

TYPES

    return	null value

DESCRIPTION
    This function frees the memory used for the values of all unscoped
    static variables by in effect assigning null values to them.  As this
    will usually have significant effects of any functions in whose
    definitions these variables have been used, it is primarily intended
    for use when these functions are being undefined or redefined..

EXAMPLE
    > static a = 5
    > define f(x) = a++ * x;
    f() defined
    > global a
    > f(1)
	    5
    > show statics
