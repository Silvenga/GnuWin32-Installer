 * We test the new code generator declaration scope and order.
 *
 * In this function two static variables a5100 and b5100 are created,
 * with zero value, when the definition is read.
 *
 * The variable a5100 is initialized with the value x if and when this
 * function is first called with a positive even x. The varable b5100
 * is similarly initialized if and when this function is first called positive
 * odd x.
 *
 * Each time this function is called with positive integer x, a5100 or
 * b5100 is incremented.
 *
 * Finally the values of the static variables are assigned to the global
 * variables a5100 and b5100.
 *
 * Immediately after the last of several calls to this function
 * a5100 = 0 if none of the x's have been positive even, otherwise
 * a5100 = the first positive even x + the number of positive even x's,
 * and b5100 = 0 if none of the x's have been positive odd, otherwise
 * b5100 = the first positive odd x + the number of positive odd x's.
