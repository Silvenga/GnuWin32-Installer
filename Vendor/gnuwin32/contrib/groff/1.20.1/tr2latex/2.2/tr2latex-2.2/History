#   commands like ``a under hat''.
#   Bug reported by Richard Walker <richard@cs.anu.edu.au>.
# - Some modifications to calm down some strange warnings on strange
#   compilers reported from the net

#   works properly.

# Revision 2.0  1992/04/22  14:17:26  Christian_Engel
# I have turned to version 2 for some important changes:
# - No support of K&R anymore. Everything turned to ANSI-C. If you only have a
#   K&R compiler transform the sources by a K&R to ANSI translator (e.g. )
#   or use tr2latex V1.04.
# - The Revisions of tr2latex are controlled by RCS.
# Furthermore, there have been some smaller improvements:
# - added support of MMS package for make under VMS. Thanks to
#   Richard L. Dyson.
#   New files: Makefile.mms, make_tr2latex.com, tr2latex.hlp, vaxcrtl.opt.
# - fixed some problems compiling on a MIPS M/2000 running RISCos
#   Thanks to David Osborne <cczdao@mips.ccc.nottingham.ac.uk>
