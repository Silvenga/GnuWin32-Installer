Groff: text processing utilities

Description
-----------
The groff (GNU Troff) software is a typesetting package which reads plain text mixed with formatting commands and produces formatted output. Groff now supports HTML. Included in this release are implementations of troff, pic, eqn, tbl, refer, grap, the -man macros and the -ms macros, and drivers for PostScript, TeX dvi format, HP LaserJet 4 printers, HTML format (still alpha), and typewriter-like devices. Also included is a modified version of the Berkeley -me macros, and an implementation of the -mm macros. Besides Groff, the package contains Grap<http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grap.htm>, Deroff<http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/deroff.htm>, PolyglotMan<http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/polyglotman.htm> and Troff2LaTeX. There may be newer versions of Grap and Deroff. The Html preprocessor of Groff is now included.

Installation
------------
Groff can be installed in any directory, provided the subdirectory structure is maintained. Groff first looks for the compiled-in location of its macro and font files (C:/Progra~1/Groff/share/groff), and then in share/groff in the actual installation directory. Alternative locations of the macro and font files can be given by setting several environment variables: - GROFF_TMAC_PATH: A semicolon separated list of directories in which to search for macro files. groff will scan directories given in the M option before those in GROFF_TMAC_PATH, and then the standard directories: - the directories specified with troff/groff’s -M command line option; - the directories given in the GROFF_TMAC_PATH environment variable; - the current directory (only if in unsafe mode, which is enabled by the -U command line switch); - the home directory; - a platform-specific directory: c:/progra 1/Groff/lib/groff/site-tmac, or if this does not exist: <install directory>/lib/groff/site-tmac; - a site-specific (platform-independent) directory: c:/progra 1/Groff/share/groff/site-tmac, or if this does not exist: <install directory>/share/groff/site-tmac; - the main tmac directory: c:/progra 1/Groff/share/groff/<version>/tmac, or if this does not exist: <install directory>/share/groff/<version>/tmac, where <version> is the current version number of Groff (at present 1.19.1). - GROFF_FONT_PATH: A semicolon separated list of directories in which to search for the devname directory. groff will scan directories given in the -F option before these, and then in the standard directories: - the directories specified with troff/groff’s -F command line option; - the directories given in the GROFF_FONT_PATH environment variable; - a site-specific (platform-independent) directory: c:/progra~1/Groff/share/groff/site-font, or if this does not exist: <install directory>/share/groff/site-font; - the main tmac directory: c:/progra~1/Groff/share/groff/<version>/font, or if this does not exist: <install directory>/share/groff/<version>/font; - /usr/lib/font. - GRAP_DEFINES: A semicolon separated list of directories in which grap searches its defines file. If that value is a relative path name, the path specified in the M option given to grap will be searched for it. GRAP_DEFINES overrides the compiled in location of the defines file (C:/Progra~1/Groff/share/grap/grap.defines), but may be overridden by the files specified in the D option given to grap. Note that in the present version of groff it is not possible to give the D option to groff; it will not pass it on to grap. For example, if the current version number is 1.19.1 and your macro and font files are in D:\Applications\Groff, then, assuming you have kept the subdirectory structures for these files, you should set the following: - set GROFF_TMAC_PATH=D:/Applic~1/Groff/share/groff/site-tmac;D:/Applic~1/Groff/share/groff/1.19.1/tmac - set GROFF_FONT_PATH=D:/Applic~1/Groff/share/groff/1.19.1/font - set GRAP_DEFINES=D:/Applic~1/Groff/share/grap/grap.defines Note that there is no need to set these environment variables if Groff is installed in D:\Applications\Groff; it will then itself find its macro and font files. Documentation Manuals in several formats (Windows Help, Info, Postscript and Pdf) are in Groff\doc, Groff\info and Groff\man and their subfolders. The original Unix documents can be found at the Troff documentation-page<http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/troff.htm>. Viewing Groff output Groff can produce TeX-dvi-output, Postscript, Ascii and Html. To view and print dvi-files you must use a dvi-viewer, e.g. Yap<http://miktex.org>, WinDvi<http://xemtex.groups.foundry.supelec.fr> or DviOut<http://akagi.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/dviout-ftp.html>. Yap and WinDvi are part of TeX-distributions for Windows, DviOut is a stand-alone dvi-viewer. They can also be found at any CTAN-archive<http://www.tug.org/ctan.html>. Postscript can be viewed and printed with Ghostscript<http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost>, which can also convert Postscript to Pdf.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in groff-1.20.1-GnuWin32.diffs in groff-1.20.1-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
