x86info v1.21            http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/x86info
Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>

Somewhere in the mists of time, there was a program by Phil Karn (KA9Q)
called cpuid, which identified CPU. It didn't get updated very often,
and quickly got out of date. It also didn't do much more than just
simple decoding.

x86info was written to succeed Phils work. Initially, it borrowed some bits
from his code, but the last remnants are now long gone. Additional functionality
has been added, such as support for SMP, and building on non-Linux platforms.



Features:
 - SMP support.
 - Recognition of all Intel/AMD/IDT/Cyrix/VIA CPUs.
 - Parsing of model specific registers.
 - Approximation of current CPU MHz.


Caveats:
*  For usage of the MSR / SMP functions, x86info needs the
   x86 cpuid driver provided with the Linux kernel since 2.2.18 / 2.4.0,
   and the appropriate nodes in /dev

   To set up these devices, do the following..

	mkdir /dev/cpu
	for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
	do
		mkdir /dev/cpu/$i ; cd /dev/cpu/$i
		mknod cpuid c 203 $i
		mknod msr c 202 $i
	done

*  If you are using the cpuid / msr drivers built as modules
   as opposed to built into the kernel, then you should ensure
   the following is in your /etc/modules.conf

	alias char-major-202 msr
	alias char-major-203 cpuid

Info on the command line switches can be found in the man page.
