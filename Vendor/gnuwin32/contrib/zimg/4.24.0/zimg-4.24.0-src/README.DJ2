ZIMG was compiled with DJGPP v.2 and linked against GD 1.8.3,
libjpeg, libpng and libz, thus it produces PNG and JPEG files.

The executable needs a DPMI host to run, either CWSDPMI (available
e.g. from the DJGPP site), or launched from a DOS box under
MS-Windows 3.x/9x/2000/NT.

Config.dj2 and Makefile.dj2 are needed to compile ZIMG 4.4.0 from
sourcecode. The GD1.83, LPNG, ZLIB and JPEG-6B directories should
be present one level above ZIMG sourcefiles.
