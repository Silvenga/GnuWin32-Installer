    zimg -- display 2-D data of arbitrary format
    Copyright (C) 1999 - 2003  Johannes Zellner


INSTALLATION:

    UNIX:

    o first you need to have Thomas Boutell's gif driver gd (libgd).
      (for further information see http://www.boutell.com/gd/)
      in principle it is possible to compile zimg w/o the gd gif
      driver, but as many zimg options won't work then this is 
      discouraged.

    o ./configure
      you might supply the path to the gd header files with 
      --with-gd-includes=.. and the path to the gd lib `libgd.a'
      --with-gd-lib=<your/path>. Of course the usual prefix switches
      are also supported.
      Watch the configure output, if the headers are found.
      After configuring you might want to check config.h:
      all `HAVE' gd includes shoud be defined to `1'.

      use --disable-edf, if you want to disable support for
      ESRF data format (edf) files.

    o make

    o make install
      this will also install the zimg.1 man page.


    OS/2:
    o use Makefile.os2 and copy config.os2 to config.h

    DJGPP:
    o see README.DJ2 (as for OS/2: use MAKEFILE.DJ2 and CONFIG.DJ2)
    copy CONFIG.DJ2 to config.h

    for both OS/2 and DJGPP you've eventually to make modifications to
    the Makefile and the config file `by hand' as the unix configure
    script is not used.  This means basically deciding, which gd version
    you use:
    - gif gd version (e.g.: gd1.3)
	config.h:
	    #define GD_HAS_GIF
	    #define GD_HAS_PNG
	Makefile:
	    -lgd
    - png / jpeg gd version (e.g.: gd1.8)
	config.h:
	    /* #define GD_HAS_GIF */
	    /* #define GD_HAS_PNG */
	Makefile:
	    -lgd -lpng -lz -lgd
	    (see for example MAKEFILE.DJ2)
