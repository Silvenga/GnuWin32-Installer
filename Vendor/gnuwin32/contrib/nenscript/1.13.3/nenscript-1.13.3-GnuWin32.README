* Nenscript-1.13.3 for Windows *
================================

What is it?
-----------
Nenscript: format an ASCII file and convert to PostScript

Description
-----------
A clone of the proprietary enscript program from Adobe Systems. For those
who have never used enscript, it is a good ASCII to Postscript converter.

The main features of nenscript are:
- produces Postscript output which fully conforms to the Document Structuring Conventions
- support for normal and "gaudy" output
- support for single or double column output
- allows insertion of titles and headers in any font.
- multiple copies of a document

Features additional to nenscript are:
- automatic wrapping of long lines
- availability under MSDOS 
- executable is self contained - no additional files required

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in nenscript-1.13.3-GnuWin32.diffs in nenscript-1.13.3-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
