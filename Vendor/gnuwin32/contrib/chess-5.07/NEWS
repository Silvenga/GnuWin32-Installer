New in gnuchess 5.05:

- Fixed a potential buffer overflow in pgn.c.
- General code cleanups, bug fixes, and probably introduction
  of new bugs, especially in pondering related code
- The opening book is now looked for in 
  /usr/lib/games/gnuchess/book.dat if it is not found in the
  working directory.
- Changes for easing compilation with MSVC
- Removed support for the Novag Universal Board. The recommended

New in gnuchess 5.04:
- Bug fixes (as always)

New in gnuchess 5.03:
- Bug fixes (The infamous "illegal move" bug should be dead by now.)
- Architecture independent binary book. Yes, you may now move your
  binary book around between little and big endian, 32 and 64 bit
  machines and it should not break. 
- Build system is now automake/autoconf, should ease porting gnuchess
  to your favorite strange architecture. (Hell, what about gnuchess on
  cellphones...?)
