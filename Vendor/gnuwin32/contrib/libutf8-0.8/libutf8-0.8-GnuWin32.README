* LibUTF8-0.8 for Windows *
===========================

What is it?
-----------
LibUTF8:	Unicode/UTF-8 locale plugin

Description
-----------
This library provides UTF-8 locale support, for use on systems which don't
have UTF-8 locales, or whose UTF-8 locales are unreasonably slow.

It provides support for
  - the wchar_t and wint_t types,
  - the mbs/wcs functions typically found in <stdlib.h>,
  - the wide string functions typically found in <wchar.h>,
  - the wide character classification functions typically found in <wctype.h>,
  - some of the wide character I/O functions typically found in <wchar.h>,
  - the setlocale function typically found in <locale.h>.
All this according to the ISO/ANSI C specifications, and with support for
old 8-bit locales and Unicode UTF-8 locales.

libutf8 is for you if your application supports 8-bit and multibytes locales
like chinese or japanese, and you wish to add UTF-8 locale support but the
corresponding support lacks from your system.

libutf8 is for you also if your application supports only 8-bit locales, and
you wish to add UTF-8 locale support. Because libutf8 implements an ISO/ANSI C
compatible set of types and functions, the support for libutf8 you add will
also automatically work (without libutf8) with other multibytes locales,
as far as supported by the system.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in libutf8-0.8-GnuWin32.diffs in libutf8-0.8-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
