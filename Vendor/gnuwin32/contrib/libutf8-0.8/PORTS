* Linux with libc6:
  OK

* Linux with libc5:
  If you have egcs, including both <stddef.h> and <wchar.h> leads to warnings:

/usr/include/wchar.h:62: warning: redefinition of `wint_t'
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-pc-linux-gnulibc1/egcs-2.91.66/include/stddef.h:280: warning: `wint_t' previously declared here

  The warnings are harmless, since libutf8 will redefine this type anyway,
  To get rid of the warnings, change line 54 in /usr/include/wchar.h:

  /* FIXME: should this go into <stddef.h>???  */
! #if 0
  #define __need_wint_t
  #include <stddef.h>
  #else
  /* Integral type unchanged by default argument promotions that can
     hold any value corresponding to members of the extended character
     set, as well as at least one value that does not correspond to any
     member of the extended character set.  */
  typedef unsigned int wint_t;
  #endif

to

  /* FIXME: should this go into <stddef.h>???  */
! #if (__GNUC__ == 2 && __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 8) || (__GNUC__ > 2)

  Normal library OK. Plugin cannot be built because of an incorrect prototype
  for `wcstok' in /usr/include/wchar.h.
