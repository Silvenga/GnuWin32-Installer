Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 2.03 - a PDF viewer for X


Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer for X.  The Xpdf
project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript
converter, and various other utilities.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32 systems and
should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++ compiler.

Major changes:
* Rewrote the text extractor to:
  - do a better job with rotated text;
  - handle right-to-left scripts;
  - be faster.
* Changed the zoom setting to use a percentage (relative to 72 dpi)
  instead of a zoom "factor".
* If the PDF file has an outline, open the outline pane initially.
* Added -f and -l options to pdfinfo; print multiple page sizes.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:
