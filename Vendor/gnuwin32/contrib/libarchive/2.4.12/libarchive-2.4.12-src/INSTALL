On most Unix-like systems, you should be able to install libarchive
and bsdtar using the following common steps:
    ./configure
    make
    make install

If you need to customize the target directories or otherwise adjust
the build setting, use
    ./configure --help
to list the configure options.

To build and install only libarchive:
    ./configure
    make
    cd libarchive && make install

To build and install only bsdtar (assumes a suitable
libarchive is already installed on the system):
    ./configure
    cd tar && make && make install
