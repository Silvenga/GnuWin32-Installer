--------
LORENZO
--------

remove some rules in parser.y by using possible empty symbols
(such as argtype...)

yesno should really be required?  If not given could be inferred as "no".

CONF PARSER

allow lines with comments at the end:
option value # comment

OPTIONS

additional options such as multiple and argoptional could be
given also in different order...  make a list of such options

ENUM

also in parsing, create an option struct, so that parsing rules
can be re-used easily (e.g., the group options)

Implement synonyms

Should - be always interpreted as the standard output

Generate code that uses Argp

Duplicate options: A @dfn{duplicate option} is an option that, like a
multiple option, may be specified more than once, but for which only
the last use is significant.   The classic example is the @option{-O}
switch present in most C compilers:

maintainer-mode

document that an option can span more lines.

remove getopt.c and getopt1.c?

check override for config/cmdline and cmdline/config

make a version of _parser that takes the parameters in a struct
_parser_options
and an init function for options
and add the parameter error_on_dup
