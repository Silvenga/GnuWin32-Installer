* Units-1.87 for Windows *
==========================

What is it?
-----------
Units: unit conversion and calculation

Description
-----------
Units is a program for units conversion and units calculation. The program converts quantities expressed in various scales to their equivalents in other scales. Units can only handle multiplicative scale changes. For example, it cannot convert Celsius to Fahrenheit but it can convert temperature differences between those temperature scales. The units are defined in an external data file. Units comes with an extensive, well annotated data file that defines over 2000 units. Alternatively you can provide your own data file to suit your needs. The Units database includes scientific values, historical units, and useful day to day values such as the densities of cooking ingredients, needed to convert between European and American recipes.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in units-1.87-GnuWin32.diffs in units-1.87-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
