Version 1.87 - 25 Sep 2007

* Units reads ~/.units.dat if it exists before reading the standard
  units database.  
* Added support for ** as an exponent operator.
* Type 'search text' to list units that contain 'text' in their name.
* Precedence of '*' changed to match precedence of '/'.
  (Multiplication by juxtaposition retains a higher precedence than
  '/'.)  The --oldstar option selects the old precedence and --newstar
  forces the new precedence.  

Version 1.86 - 10 Nov 2006

* Added --one-line (-1) option which causes the program to print only
  one line of output. 
* Added --compact option which causes the program to print only the
  conversion factors and a newline on output.
* Added build support for DESTDIR.
* Made minor changes that allow the program to be compiled into a
  library and linked with other programs.
* Fixed bug that caused bus error on Intel Mac.

Version 1.85 - 20 May 2005

* The '-' character by default indicates subtraction.  Multiplication can be
  obtained by '*' or ' '.  The --product (-p) option selects the old behavior
  where '-' acts as a multiplication operator.  The --minus (-m) option forces
  the default behavior where '-' indicates subtraction.
* Handing of radian and steradian changed.  These units are now treated as
  conformable with 1 for units conversions.  This is indicated by the
  "!dimensionless" tag in units.dat.
* Unit files can be included using !include.
* Multiple -f (--file) options can appear on the command line; giving
  a null filename (-f '') causes the default units database to be loaded.
* Added -t (--terse) option.
* Improved error checking for units.dat. 
* Corrected and extended units.dat.  


Version 1.81 - October 28, 2002

* Fixed missing definition of "au" in units.dat.  


Version 1.80 - June 16, 2002

* Rewritten parser supports 
  - () for grouping
  - noninteger powers of numbers (e.g. 3^0.25)
  - functions with dimensionless arguments (log, ln, log2, sin, cos, tan, exp)
  - roots of units: sqrt(unit), cuberoot(unit), and higher roots as unit^(1|4)
* Functions can be defined in units.dat, and conversion to a function
  performed by specifying the function name alone as the "want" item. 
* Unit conversions can be specified as tables with linear interpolation. 
* The "help" command summarizes operations, and "help unit" browses the units
  database at the definition of the specified unit.  
* Specifying "?" for the want unit gets a list of all conformable units.  
* Support for locales added.  
* Units file extended and corrected.


Version 1.55 - July 30, 1999

* Added over 600 new units and corrected errors in the units data file.
* Minor bug fix affecting unit name completion.


Version 1.54 - July 15, 1997

* Switched order of prefix and plural handling (plurals are now done first)
* Added reciprocal unit conversion and --strict (-s) option
* Fixed some erroneous unit definitions, added currency codes and other units
* Improved Makefile (exec-prefix, program-transform-name supported)
* Bug fixes


Version 1.53 - Jan 13, 1997

* Added units containing ISO 8859-1 characters
* Bug fixes 


Version 1.52 - Dec 18, 1996

* Sums of conformable units 
* Printing of unit definitions 
* Unitname completion with readline
* Added --verbose (-v) option and moved --version to -V
* Improved portability, old style C support, improved Makefile
