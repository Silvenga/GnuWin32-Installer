     | units 1.81 for OS/2 |
     =======================

I have just compiled the source from the Unix version by adding a small
Makefile.OS2. To compile yourself you will need some GNU utilities (like
rm, cp), gcc-3.0.x from Netlabs, GNU make, perl and GNU groff. 
Then you should be able to do "make -f Makefile.OS2 dist" to have 
everything sitting in the dist directory.

I have substituted the 'col' command using 'sed', so there is now nice
OS/2 readable documentation in units.doc. If you have 'less' installed, 
you can view the file units.less as well which then shows colored and
highlighted text.

To run you will need the EMX.DLL which you can find on the OS/2 ftp sites
like http://hobbes.nmsu.edu or ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2. 
Unzip everything into the same directory and run makeobjs.cmd to make two
program objects on your desktop.

Please send any comments about the OS/2 version to me.
