attr-2.4.14 (14 January 2004)
	- When attr_copy_file is used on a symlink, process the
	  symlink instead of the file the symlink points to.
	- Improve wording in attr(5) man page.
	- Add the security namespace into the attr(1) command and
	  libattr IRIX-compatibility code for XFS commands to use.

attr-2.4.13 (06 January 2004)
	- Fix a permission bug in directory tree walking code.

attr-2.4.12 (13 October 2003)
	- Fix build on the GNU/Hurd platform for some Debian folks.

attr-2.4.11 (07 October 2003)
	- Man page tweaks

attr-2.4.10 (29 August 2003)
	- Fix a bug in nftw worker routines' error handling code.

attr-2.4.9 (27 August 2003)
	- Fix issues in the libmisc quote routine (from Ben Escoto).

attr-2.4.8 (04 August 2003)
	- Make quote/unquote return NULL if passed NULL. 

attr-2.4.7 (29 July 2003)
	- Make quote return NULL if out of memory instead of exiting. 

attr-2.4.6 (21 July 2003)
	- Add internal library for misc. functions: quote, unquote,
	  high_water_alloc.
	- Quote special characters in path names and attribute names.
	- Use high_water_alloc everywhere instead of malloc/realloc.
	- Update the test scripts.
	
attr-2.4.5 (03 July 2003)
	- Tweak the build so we don't always run msgmerge,
	  fix from Steve Langasek originally.

attr-2.4.4 (04 June 2003)
	- Some Debian-specific packaging updates.

attr-2.4.3 (26 April 2003)
	- Rework configure.in to make use of shared macros.

attr-2.4.2 (14 April 2003)
	- Found a better way to handle the trusted/xfsroot namespace
	  transition, from a suggestion from Andreas.  COMPAT_XFSROOT
	  is no longer checked, we figure this out on-the-fly now.
	- Fix configure tests that used AC_PATH_PROG incorrectly.

attr-2.4.1 (27 March 2003)
	- Cleanups to the build process, in particular the automatic
	  rpm package generation Makefile and spec file template.
	- Makepkgs script can now propagate failures back from make.
	- Change default --prefix to /usr.

attr-2.4.0 (26 February 2003)
	- Add symbol level versioning to libattr. This improves link
	  time consistency checks. The library versions are also
	  honored by RPM, so an RPM package built against say,
	  libattr.so.1(ATTR_1.1) won't link against
	  libattr.so.1(ATTR_1.0), which was not checked before.
	- Make the default check function used by attr_copy_{fd,file}()
	  accessible as attr_copy_check_permissions().
	- Increment the library version number, so that the attr_copy
	  functions can be checked for.
	- Fix some minor typos.

attr-2.3.0 (21 February 2003)
	- By default, we use the "trusted" attribute name prefix for
	  XFS ROOT attribute names, instead of the "xfsroot" prefix.
	  If the COMPAT_XFSROOT environment variable is set, however,
	  the old (now deprecated) names are used.  This is useful for
	  XFS kernel code older than, well, today.  Newer kernels will
	  work correctly with the new tools (but not the old tools).
	- Added routines to libattr for copying extended attributes -
	  attr_copy_file and attr_copy_fd.
	- libattr.so version updated to reflect these changes.
	- Update licensing notice in system call man pages for aeb.

attr-2.2.0 (30 November 2002)
	- Complete the internationalisation support, and added initial
	  German translation from Andreas.

attr-2.1.2 (22 November 2002)
	- Add a description of trusted extended attributes to attr(5).

attr-2.1.1 (31 October 2002)
	- Minor updates to the Debian packaging.

attr-2.1.0 (19 October 2002)
	- Change the devel .rpm and .deb package names so that they
	  now use a lib prefix.
	- Several packaging changes related to this to ensure upgrades
	  work and depenency information isn't lost.

attr-2.0.12 (07 October 2002)
	- Fix: the m68k architecture is identified by __mc68000__
	  rather than by __m68k__.
	- Correction in the attr(5) manual page.
	- Add test cases for empty EA values, and for a bad
	  ACL extended attribute name (there were bugs with these).

attr-2.0.11 (04 September 2002)
	- Make the test/run script return a proper status code.
	- Fix up the error message returned for ENODATA rather
	  than ENOATTR, so if ENOATR is assigned a separate number
	  we don't mess with ENOATTR's text message.

attr-2.0.10 (28 August 2002)
	- Add system call numbers for the m68k architecture
	- Add missing "enabling" #define for the Alpha architecture
	- Build updates to allow rpmbuild to build rpms (newer versions
	  of rpm require this, as rpm itself can no longer build rpms)
	- Several section 3 man page corrections (minor)

attr-2.0.9 (04 July 2002)
	- Build infrastructure updates so that configure options can be
	  used to specify paths rather than semi-hard-coded path names
	  controlled by the PREFIX/ROOT_PREFIX environment variables; eg.
	  now allows /lib64 and /lib32
	- Add system call numbers for the Alpha architecture

attr-2.0.8 (22 April 2002)
	- Minor wording change in the attr(5) manual page
	- Additional test cases for malformed attribute names
	- Remove leftover build targets html and ps

	- Several man page updates

attr-2.0.5 (12 March 2002)
	- Fix build for architectures which don't have syscalls yet
	- Fix the syscall number used on Sparc for fremovexattr(2)
	- Test script updates
	- Man page updates

attr-2.0.4 (05 March 2002)
	- A minor change to the test/run script

attr-2.0.3 (01 March 2002)
	- add in ARM architecture system call numbers
	- updates to the test output from Andreas

attr-2.0.2 (27 February 2002)
	- add in S/390 system call numbers from Martin Schwidefsky
	- revert IA64 syscall numbering after further mail with
	  David Mosberger (apparently sys_tkill will be moved)
	  See:	https://external-lists.valinux.com/archives/\
			/linux-ia64/2002-February/002990.html

attr-2.0.1 (26 February 2002)
	- incorporate several documentation changes from Andreas,
	  including a script to convert from the aget format of
	  attribute backup file, to the new getfattr format
	- fix IA64 syscall numbering

attr-2.0.0 (26 February 2002)
	- initial introduction of the new system call interface
	- synced up with the ext2 project, incorporated get/set tools
	- new man pages for system calls, getfattr(1) and setfattr(1)
	- made the attributes.h interface align properly with IRIX

attr-1.1.3 (03 August 2001)
	- bug fix from Juer Lee, syscall use on non-i386 was broken
	- tested on PowerPC and i386; code is simpler and works
	- install an additional library symlink for ld, so that the
	  shared lib is always found before the static lib at link time

attr-1.1.2 (27 July 2001)
	- fixes for (hopefully) the last few nits in libtool usage

attr-1.1.1 (23 July 2001)
	- install static libs and libtool archives into /usr/lib
	- shared libraries are unchanged, however

attr-1.1.0 (16 July 2001)
	- reworked Makefiles to use libtool
	- rework some of the Debian packaging rules
	- install attr command into /usr/bin, not /bin
	- libattr now installed into /lib instead of /usr/lib
	  as it is needed by xfsdump and xfsrestore which must
	  be available for recovery when only root is mounted

attr-1.0.4 (02 July 2001)
	- work around syscall number collision on recent ia64 kernels

attr-1.0.3 (18 May 2001)
	- man page corrections

attr-1.0.2 (24 April 2001)
	- rearrange headers to make system call internals private
	- update package descriptions

attr-1.0.1 (30 January 2001)
	- minor rpm and deb packaging work
