Here's what I consider to be the most important tasks with hodie for
now...

* Grammar fixing!!! Tell me if you know latin and know any of my forms
  to be wrong! I'm no authority on the language (yet), and may very
  well make mistakes all over the place.

* Win32 porting and X/Window and Win32 interface
  building... (humanists are seldom _that_ fond of command line
  interfaces :-)
