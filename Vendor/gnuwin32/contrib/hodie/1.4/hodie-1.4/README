Welcome to hodie and the fascinating world of latin speakers. This
program exists because of my getting a few wild ideas while browsing
the challenges of dotcomma <http://www.dotcomma.org>.

What does it do?
     It has the same functionality as the date (1) program, only... It
     has it in grammatically correct latin :-)

How do I install it?
     As I still haven't had the possibility to check out exactly how
     autoconf/automake works, you'll still have to take a look at the
     Makefile. 

     It's designed to work well with my own, local linux system and
     the way _I_ run it. This means, that above all else, you might
     wish to take a *good* look at the placements of files (/usr vs
     /usr/local) and other such issues. All this is done at the top of
     the Makefile.

     Once you feel at ease (or if you're foolish enough to trust me
     with my judgement), you do

	make	# (make all and make hodie also work)
	make install

     and you should be ready to go.

Dependencies???
     I do assume, that you have a halfways decent UNIX-system,
     preferrably with make, a c-compiler and enough standard libraries
     to support printfs and time-functions... Apart from that, it
     should be totally ANSI-C, and I cannot see why it shouldn't be
     fully portable. It's nothing *really* fancy anyway :-)

Licenses? 
     I release this software under the MIT license. (No, not the GPL
     license. Mainly because I do not quite understand the GPL license
     myself as I do with the MIT and the BSD types.)

     The license conditions are reproduced in the file LICENSE, which
     should be included in every distribution of this software.

     All the spanish stuff is (c) Ivan Juanes. If you can't find any
     spanish stuff, then this does not apply (beginning with my moving
     in at sourceforge, I split spanish and english into two different
     branches. 

Who did this?
     Responsible for this hacklet is

     Please do e-mail... I'm only happy for feedback :-)
