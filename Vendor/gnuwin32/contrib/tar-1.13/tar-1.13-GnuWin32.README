* Tar-1.13 for Windows *
========================

What is it?
-----------
Tar: archiver tool

Description
-----------
The tar program provides the ability to create tar archives, as well as
various other kinds of manipulation. For example, you can use tar on
previously created archives to extract files, to store additional files,
or to update or list files which were already stored. 

The Win32 port can only create tar archives, but cannot pipe its output
to other programs such as gzip or compress, and will not create tar.gz
archives.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in tar-1.13-GnuWin32.diffs in tar-1.13-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
