The PDB header record was figured out/compiled by Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>
(the PDB header is the same as the PRC application header),
the layout of the Image Viewer image header was figured out by
Eric.Arnold@sun.com (I kinda' stole the format from his ppmtoIVpdb program
which was posted to the pilot-unix mailing list).  I figured out
the compression format, notes, and monochrome format and wrapped it all
together as ipdb*.c.  The programs are pretty thin wrappers around ipdb*.c.

Support for depth 4 grayscale (i.e. 16 shades of gray) images was graciously
supplied by Munechika SUMIKAWA <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>.  I think
you need a Palm IIIx or better to view such images.

This package was developed on i486-unknown-linux but I have tested the code
on a SPARC-10, HP-PA, and DEC Alpha to check for byte order and type size
problems.  All the code is pretty strict ANSI so I don't expect any
difficulties on any modern unixen (YMMV anywhere else).  I think the new
autoconf hackery should take care of various endian issues; however,
I've left the run-time endian checks in the code as a backup option.  I'm
also assuming the following sizes:

	unsigned char  == 1 byte
	unsigned short == 2 bytes
	unsigned int   == 4 bytes

These are not guaranteed to work but they do work on all the systems that
I care about, see "mine/slop.h" if you need to fiddle with these.

Notes on the Image Viewer pdb format can be found in ipdb*.[ch].

Two and four bit palettes for the GIMP can be found in Pilot and Pilot16.

I don't really have any use for the Pilot Image Viewer program, I just did
this out of curiosity (and because I find GUI only converters a little
silly).  These programs have no connection with the Image Viewer author
so don't send problem reports to him (unless it is a bug in Image Viewer).

I don't guarantee that the converted images will be correct but I think
they will be okay (I have tested all the images in samples with the viewer
without incident).  Don't blame me if any of the converted images crash your
pilot, if one does and you find out why, let me know so I can fix the tools
(or just send me a patch).
