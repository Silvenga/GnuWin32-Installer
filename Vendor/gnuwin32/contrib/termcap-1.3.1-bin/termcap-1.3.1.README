* TermCap-1.3.1 for Windows *
=============================

What is it?
-----------
TermCap: terminal-capability library

Description
-----------
This is the GNU termcap library -- a library of C functions that
enable programs to send control strings to terminals in a way
independent of the terminal type.  The GNU termcap library does not
place an arbitrary limit on the size of termcap entries, unlike most
other termcap libraries.

Most of this package is also distributed with GNU Emacs, but it is
available in this separate distribution to make it easier to install
as -ltermcap.  However, use of termcap is discouraged.  Termcap is
being phased out in favor of the terminfo-based ncurses library, which
contains an emulation of the termcap library routines in addition to
an excellent curses implementation.  ncurses is available from the
usual GNU archive sites.
