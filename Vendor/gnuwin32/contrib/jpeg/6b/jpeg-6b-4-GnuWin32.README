* Jpeg-6b for Windows *
=======================

What is it?
-----------
Jpeg: library and tools for JPEG images

Description
-----------
This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and
decompression.  JPEG is a standardized compression method for full-color
and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for "real-world" scenes; cartoons
and other non-realistic images are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy,
meaning that the output image is not identical to the input image.
The user can trade off output image quality against compressed file size
by adjusting a compression parameter.

The distributed programs provide conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and
image files in PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, GIF, BMP, and Targa file formats.  The
core compression and decompression library can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.

Package Availability
--------------------
- in: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net
Installation
------------
Older packages, such as libwmf-0.2.2, netpbm-10.6, and wv-0.7.2,
sometimes need libjpeg.dll.
Until these are updated, a provisional solution is to copy
jpeg-62.dll to libjpeg.dll.

Sources
-------
- jpeg-6b-4-src.zip

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in jpeg-6b-4-GnuWin32.diffs in jpeg-6b-4-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
