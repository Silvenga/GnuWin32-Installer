Filetype Installation:

For UNIX systems:

	make
	make install

	The install will copy 'filetype' and 'filetype-compile' to
        /usr/local/bin and copy 'filetype.spec' to /etc


For Windows systems:

	This software has been compiled using VC v6.x using the
	'makefile.vc' makefile.

	I ( Paul L Daniels ) have not verified the Win32 version but
	have accepted this makefile and associated source code in good
	faith from Karl-Heinz Bussian.

	If you have any issues with the Win32 version, please bring
	them to the filetype mailing list.


Regards
