FileType consists of the following components;

- libfiletype
   Provides all the filetype facilities within a single small package
   which can be incorporated into any existing C code via it's
   very simple API

- filetype-compile
   used to convert text based filetype descriptions / signatures into
   a binary format, facilitating the rapid buildup/teardown which is
   highly important in the Xamime project ( from where libfiletype has
   been sourced )

- filetype
   A usable filetype reporting program with similar features to the
   commonly used 'file' program.  'filetype' can also be used as a
   guide to incorporating libfiletype into your own codebase.

Using the applications:

   Before you can actually use filetype, you have to create a
   filetype.spec file.

   The filetype.spec file is a binary version of the
   filetype.list text file. Filetype uses a binary version of
   the list file in order to drastically reduce the time and
   CPU requirements of parsing/decoding a text file specification.

   To create a filetype.spec file, use the 'filetype-compile'
   program, as follows:

	./filetype-compile filetype.list filetype.spec

   ... this will create 'filetype.spec' using the details as given
   in the filetype.list

   Copy the resultant filetype.spec file to your /etc dir

   You may now run 'filetype' against any file you wish to see if it
   can determine the filetype, ie:

./filetype *
LICENSE				Unknown.
Makefile			Unknown.
README				Unknown.
filetype			"Linux ELF32" (Linux ELF binary 32bit)
filetype-compile		"Linux ELF32" (Linux ELF binary 32bit)
filetype-compile.c		"C code" (C source code)
