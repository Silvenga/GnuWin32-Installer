	PLD: Cleared new source code by running by valgrind

	PLD: Added filetype.1, filetype-compile.1, updated Makefile
			and accepted reformatted documents from Brixen. 

         Added 'make validate' for local testing purposes here


29-Mar-04
	PLD: Ripped out old Xamime code out of libfiletype (which was never
			actually compiled in due to it being left out from the #ifdef
			clauses.

			Added FILETYPE_is_file_of_type() which is a function which will
			test to see if a file matches the type description supplied as
			apposed to testing the type /index/ (as with FILETYPE_is_filetype())


24-Oct-03
	PLD: Fixed possible underrun on result counter in FILETYPE_is_binary
			thanks to dimitry for noticing the segfault.

05-Mar-03
	PLD: FileType now additionally searches for a filetype.spec file
			in the directory where the filetype program is invoked
			(based on the path specified when invoking filetype, ie
			/usr/local/bin/filetype will cause filetype to look for
			a specfile in /usr/local/bin )

	PLD: Applied patches from Karl-Heinz Bussian to make FileType
			compile on WIN32 platforms.  A special makefile, 
			makefile.vc has been added to the -dev package

03-Mar-03
	PLD: Activated -d/--debug parameters

	PLD: Removed dependency on 'key' values from the filetype engine,
			now filetype spec lists can just start with a '-:' char
			sequence to indicate that there's no specific key value
			for this filetype.  This allows for the simpler generation
			of new filetype lists.

			FILETYPE_get_filetype() returns an array index of the 
			currently loaded filetypes, you use this index to get the
			various attributes of the filetype with calls such as:

			FILETYPE_get_name_by_index()
			FILETYPE_get_comment_by_index()
			FILETYPE_get_fullclass_by_index()

		or you can get a pointer to the actual filetype record:

			FILETYPE_get_details_by_index()
		
			It should be noted that using the _by_index() calls is 
			faster by the order of the length of the list.  Previously
			we would have to scan through all the list entries until a
			key match was found. This is no longer a required method 
			although the existing methods do exist for software using
			them - they will be classified as depricated at some stage.

	PLD: Cleaned up logger reports in libfiletype, there were still some
			which were specific to the Xamime engine and thus would have
			lead to possible confusion.
	

02-Mar-03
	PLD: Added ability to accept filename lists from STDIN or multiple
			textfile lists.  Filenames are seperated by line breaks. It's
			now possible to do something like:

		filetype -f lista -f listb -f - * < listc

			This will result in filetype testing for all the files in ( in order )
			lista, listb, listc and then any files matching the shell
			expansion of '*'.  If multiple '-f -' parameter pairs occur, only the
			first one will apply.

	PLD: Set filetype count limit to 10,000 and number of loadable lists to
			100. These values can be changed if required to higher values
			but will [naturally] require a recompile.

	PLD: Finished up changes to allow filetype to load multiple filetype lists
			and cleanly free allocated memory at the end of the process.  

24-Feb-03
	PLD: Changed name of FILETYPE_load() to FILETYPE_import_list() so as to 
		ensure that people do not attempt to use FILETYPE_load() as a 
		general routine thinking that it's the binary-loader for the
		spec database. _import_list() is used to convert a filetype.list
		text based file into a binary .spec file

	PLD: Added stripping of binaries to Makefile make install
	PLD: Altered _readb() specfile loading routine to facilitate the future
		ability of loading multiple specfiles and have them appended.
	PLD: Applied patch for Makefile performace/ordering (Heikki Orsila)
	PLD: Applied patch for additional Amiga filetypes (Heikki Orsila)
	PLD: Added fix for home directory path searching, as recommended by
		Heikki Orsila.
	PLD: Added verbosity options ( although there is little to be verbose
		about at this point in the development )

21-Feb-03
	PLD: Initial release
