Jef Poskanzer (jef@acme.com) invented the PBM format in the 1980s to
provide the computer graphics world with a common, trouble-free
format, a lingua-franca, for bitmaps.  The format was designed to be
simple enough that it could transmitted within an email message
without any special encapsulating and survive any translations and
recoding that an email message might go through and be easily
extractable on the other end.

In 1988, Jef distributed the forerunner of Netpbm, Pbmplus, which
gathered together the various tools he had developed to work with PBM
files.  These were mainly tools to convert between PBM and other
existing graphics formats, making it possible to deal with the Tower
Of Babel situation that had arisen with the proliferation of graphics
formats.

By the end of 1988, Jef had added the PGM and PPM formats and lots more
tools to Pbmplus.

In 1991, Jef added a variety of programs and code contributed by the
user community, and then stopped maintaining Pbmplus.  Jef never
formally renounced support for it, but simply didn't get around to
distributing any updates for over a year following his final December
10, 1991 release.

In 1993, Netpbm was developed to replace Pbmplus.  Netpbm was nothing
more than a new release of Pbmplus, and named for the fact that people
all over the world would maintain the package by submitting fixes and
enhancements over the Net.  This was a time when such worldwide
collaboration was still novel.

Then Netpbm apparently fell into neglect with the last release by its
regular maintainer in March 1994.  In September of 1995 Anthony
Thyssen released an unofficial update of it called Netpbm-1mar1994.p1,
while disclaiming any responsibity for ongoing upkeep.

The documentation in that 1995 release mentioned two different official
mailing lists concerning the package, but by April 1999, neither
existed anymore.

In September 1999, Bryan Henderson needed some minor bugs fixed, and
wanted to clean up the mess of unsupported versions and outdated
documentation of these tools.  After checking around to see if anyone
had any claims of ownership of the package, and finding none, Bryan
assumed control and responsibility for Netpbm.  

In November 1999, Thorbjoern Ravn Anderson <ravn@mip.sdu.dk> did the
same thing, for the same reason (apparently unaware of Bryan's work)
and made available an updated version (based on the 1994 release) as
described by http://sunsite.auc.dk/netpbm.  Shortly thereafter, he
discontinued his effort in deference to the new Pbmplus effort
mentioned below.  Bryan did not know about Anderson's work until March
2000.

In August 2000, the PAM format appeared.  But it took a long time
after that for there to be enough programs and library routines to
make it useful.  It still is barely known and used; PAM is more of a
direction or philosophy than a practical tool.  Along with PAM came a
whole new suite of library routines for processing both classic PNM
and PAM format images.  The new "pam" routines are easier to use.

In parallel, and unknown to Bryan, Jef was working on a new release
under the original name Pbmplus and claiming again (or maybe still) to
be maintaining Pbmplus.  He did a limited release of a beta version of
it in November 1999.  A mailing list pbmplus@acme.com was active.
Bryan learned of this effort's existence in March 2000.  No widespread
distribution ever resulted from this.

Pbmplus and Netpbm were once part of the body of X/Windows contributed
software, distributed on ftp.x.org (directory contrib/utilities).
Bryan didn't receive a response to an inquiry to the ftp.x.org owner
as to the prospect of cleaning up the Netpbm related files there.  So
Bryan instead made Metalab the new home of the source code.  But
Metalab had pretty low quality too, and in April 2000 Bryan moved the
package's home to Sourceforge.

In June 2002, Bryan reorganized the package.  Before, it was organized to
reflect the evolution of the package:  first PBM only, then PGM was added,
then PPM, and then the multi-format PNM programs.  There were four separate
subroutine libraries and each of the PBM, PGM, PPM, and PNM components was
independent of the components invented later.  Documentation was in the form
of traditional man pages.  In Release 10, the package was integrated into a
single monolithic package.  There was one subroutine library and the source
tree was divided according to program function rather than what generation
of Netpbm it related to.  All documentation was converted to HTML.

In January 2004, Netpbm started to get the linear/gamma-adjusted
sample value thing right.  Many programs had always used the gamma
adjusted values from Netpbm images as if they were linear, which
produced incorrect and rather terrible results.  Netpbm 10.20 brought
the pm_[un]gamma709() library routines and pnm_readpamrown() etc.  for
manipulating Netpbm images in floating point 0..1 sample values, both
linear and gamma-adjusted.

              tifftopnm: Fix incorrect interpretation of FILLORDER tag
              causing incorrect output with 16 bit samples and

              Change format specs to state that sample values are
              nonlinear instead of linear.

              pnmtopalm/palmtopnm: Handle PalmOS 4.0 16 bit direct
              color format.  Thanks  Bill Janssen  <janssen@parc.xerox.com>.

              pnmgamma: Add CIE Rec 709 gamma correction option.

              pnmgamma: Add -ungamma option
              
              ppmcie: Add -rec709 color system option as default so
              that it produces true PPM output (per the new spec) and
              carefully document what the program generates.
              
              ppmcie (work done by Andrew Hamilton
              <Andrew.Hamilton@colorado.edu> in May 1999 but not
              distributed):

                 1. Corrected the XYZ -> RGB transformation;
                 2. Eliminated the -interpwp option, a fudge which had been
                    necessitated by the incorrect XYZ -> RGB transformation;
                 3. Added a Gamma correction, missing in the original;
                 4. Added the option to plot u' v' chromaticity instead of x y;
                 5. Added options to suppress labels and/or axes.

              pnmscale, pnmscalefixed:  Fix bug with unwanted -verbose
              behavior.

              ppmtoeyuv: Fix memory leak.

              Eliminate pgm_pbmmaxval, ppm_pbmmaxval, and pnm_pbmmaxval
              from libpgm, libppm, and libpnm.  'maxval' argument to 
              pgm_readpgmrow() and ppm_readppmrow() already accomplishes
              this.  pnm_readpnmrow() changed to do same.  external data
              symbols like this do not work with Mingw.
         
              various changes to accomodate Mingw (native Windows)
              and DLLs with Cygwin (Windows).

              eyuvtoppm: rewrite.  Uses Netpbm libraries now.

              pstopnm: Remove gratuitous 5% margin.  Add -equalpixels,
              -imageheight, and -imagewidth options.

              pnmtopng: Read only one row at a time, not the whole image,
              into memory.  Do multiple passes through the (hopefully
              fully cached) file.  This saves memory because pnmtopng's
              internal format may use 96 times as much space per pixel 
              as the file.

              libpbm: Add pm_openr_seekable(), pm_seek(), pm_tell().

              libppm: Add ppm_computecolorhash2(), ppm_computecolorhist2().

              configure: fix bug with Solaris/Sun compiler.

              Split pbmplus.h into pm_config.h and pbm/pm.h to prepare
              for automatic generation of pm_config.h.  Move pm_*()
              subroutines from libpbm1.c to new libpm.c for clarity.

              Remove malloc.h from 411toppm.  malloc is included by
              pm_config.h, in platform-dependent way.

01.05.13 BJH  Release 9.14

              fix bug in shhopt causing wild branches.

              winicontoppm: Make alpha mask ("and") output PBM instead

              ppmtoxpm: Add --alphamask option.  Remove 256 color limit.
         
              xpmtoppm: Add --alphaout option
         
              ppmtogif: Add "=" to -transparent option to specify exact
              color.

              configure: change /bin/perl to /usr/bin/perl.  Red Hat Linux
              doesn't have /bin/perl.

              pnm/Makefile: correct bugs in link.  Thanks J Scott Berg 
              <jsberg@bnl.gov>

              Make it build on Unixware.

              behavior until July 2000)

              ppmtoeyuv: Use netpbm libraries, deal with multi-image
              input.

              Add color row color map and Floyd-Steinberg functions from

              jpegtopnm: fix crash with B&W JPEG input.

              pnmcomp: fix bug: invalid output image when overlay image

              ppmchange: fix bug: wouldn't work with maxval != 255.

              pnmtojbig: fix bug: it always says invalid maxval. 
              Thanks Bill Davidsen.

              pbmtext: fix bug: output is sometimes "not implemented"
              because of uninitialized variable.

              pnmpsnr: rewritten so as not to use Fiasco library.
              Correctly handles maxval != 255.  Works with PAM.

              Add IRIX to the configure program.  Thanks Neil Franklin 
              <franklin@arch.ethz.ch>.

              make files: add ZLIB_DIR and ZHDR_DIR variables to

              Add error message to GNUMakefile for when GNU Make is too old.

              pnmpsnr: fix bug: PGM files always compared equal.

              libpbm: improve --version to reflect that libraries are
              usually dynamically linked now, so it's the version of
              libpbm, not the program itself.

              pbmtext: add -space option.

              asciitopgm: fix crash due to memcpy that should be memset.
              Thanks Philipp Knirsch <pknirsch@redhat.com>.

              Shared libraries now build properly for Solaris, SunOS, NetBSD.

              Add jbigtopnm, pnmtojbig.  Thanks to Markus Kuhn.

              Add pnminterp, pnminterp-gen by Russell Marks.

              Add pbm_writepbmrow_packed() and pbm_readpbmrow_packed() to
              libpbm.

              pbmtolj: Add compression (-delta, -packbits, -compress) by
              Dave Platt

              Look for both /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt and /usr/openwin/lib/rgb.txt
              by default.  Improved error messages if file not found.

              pbmtext: renders character codes 0x80-0xff and 0x00-0x1f as
              whatever the font says, rather than always blank.  Thanks
              Helge Oldach.

              Fix bug in parsing of rgb.txt file in ppm_colorname().

              Add optional static library build to make files.

              Benjamin Kuit.

              Make it build on Cygwin.  Thanks Pierre Humblet.

              Use rm -f;ls instead of ls -sf in make files; some systems don't

00.04.15 BJH  Release 9.0

              Add the 16-bit-per-sample format for maxval > 255.
              Change size of samples in the library interface from 8
              bits to 32 bits.  Library write routines now create the
              new 16 bit format instead of plain format when you
              request a maxval > 255 and not 'forceplain'.  Make all
              programs read the new format, and all programs that
              convert to PNM from a >8 bit input generate it instead
              of failing or normalizing.  Make pnmdepth generate it.

              pnm_readpnminit(), etc. fails if you request a maxval >
              65535 and not 'forceplain'.  It used to generate plain
              format in that case, but you couldn't actually specify    
              a sample value > 255.

              Add pnmtorle and rletopnm from the Army High Performance 
              Computing Research Center.

              add ppmcolormask - creates a mask of areas of a certain 
              color in an image.

              anytopnm: fix infinite loop
              
              pbmtext:  Ignore non-8-bit characters in bdf files instead
              of crashing.

              ppmdither: fix crash with large dithering matrix dimensions.

              Rename ppmtompeg/headers/search.h to motion_search.h to avoid
              possible confusion with the OSF system file search.h
         
              Fix erroneous shhopt.h dependency in build.
              
00.04.03 BJH  Release 8.4

              Add ppmtompeg, adapted from Berkeley's mpeg_encode.
         
              Add eyuvtoppm and ppmtoeyuv, and vidtoppm, from Berkeley
              mpeg tools.

              Add ppmfade, adapted from Wesley C. Barris' pbmfade. 

              Add ability to extract the alpha channel to tifftopnm,
              tgatoppm, and ximtoppm.  (It's already in pngtoppm,
              and still missing from ilbmtoppm).

              pnmtotiff: Change default compression to none, due to
              removal of LZW capability from Tiff library.

              Make merge build use symbolic links instead of hard links.

              Include dependent libraries in the link of the
              libraries.  This is necessary on some systems, and a
              good idea on others.

              Use strerror() instead of sys_errlist[] everywhere.  If
              some systems do not have the former, we need to do some
              work, because strerror() was already used in some
              places.  We do have a report of a BeOS system with no
              sys_errlist[].

00.03.24 BJH  Release 8.3

              Add ppmshadow, by John Walker <http://www.fourmilab.ch/>,

              Add sbigtopgm by John Walker, dated January 1998.

              Handle BMP file color map size parameter in ppmtobmp, bmptoppm.
              Thanks Marc Moorcroft.

              Rewrite make files, fix lots of make install bugs.

00.03.20 BJH  Release 8.2

              Add ppmtojpeg and jpegtopnm.

              Rename pnmnoraw to pnmtoplainpnm.

              Add CMYK capability to tifftopnm.
 
              Major make file rewrite, especially making install work.
              Pnmmerge is no longer the default.  Shared libraries are.
 
              Add pnmtotiffcmyk.  Written by Andrew Cooke  (Jara Software)
              jara@andrewcooke.free-online.co.uk

00.03.02 BJH  Release 8.1

00.03.02 BJH  Add pnmtopng and pngtopnm.  I got these from 
              ftp://ftp.au.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/distfiles
              today.  Release 2.37.3.  I added an "unsigned" and
              changed the type of 'scaleval' to quiet compiler warnings.

00.03.01 BJH  Fix xwdtopnm interpretation of 16 bit TrueColor files.
              Thanks to Martin Kroeker, mk@daveg.com.

CHANGE LOG FROM PBMPLUS
-----------------------

Changes since the 30oct91 patch version:

    Fixed uninitialized variable in ppmtotga.  (John Walker)
    Added pgmcrater, ppmforge, ppmtoacad, sldtoppm.  (John Walker)

Changes during the extended beta test period, starting on 15jan91:

    Lots of fixes from: Anthony A. Datri, Arthur David Olson, David Brooks,
      David Elliott, Doug Claar, Duncan Sinclair, Francois Pinard, Gerard
      Leurs, Jim Hanko, Ken Laprade, Klaus U. Schallhorn, Markus Bolz, Mike
      Hench, Philip Gladstone, R C Smith, Selden E. Ball, Jr., Stephen Uitti,
      Steve Allen, Tom Lane, update.kpj-jaakkola@athena.dsv.su.se,
      Charles Karney, Unmesh Agarwala, Ed Pendzik, Juha Sarlin, Tom Tulinsky,
      Phillip Smith, Lai-King Mau, David Koblas, Mark Donovan.
    Added a global -version flag.
    Added bunches of statics and prototypes.  Now compiles with zero
      warnings under gcc -ansi -pedantic.
    Changed #ifdef __STDC__ to #if __STDC__, since some non-compliant
      compilers define it as 0.
    Changed pm_message and pm_error to be varargs routines.  Added a
      portable version of vfprintf for those systems which don't have it.
    Removed the option of not compiling the pgm and ppm parts.  Very few
      people used it, and it added amazing complexity to the pnm programs,
      turning them into maintenance nightmares.
    Merged pbmpaste into pnmpaste.
    Merged pgmtops and ppmtops into pnmtops.
    Added auto-scaling and dpi / page size flags to pnmtops.
    Changed the interpretation of bits in pbmlife to conform with other

      ppmconvol to pnmconvol;
      ppmcscale to pnmdepth;
      ppmrotate to pnmrotate;
      ppmscale to pnmscale;
      ppmshear to pnmshear;
      ppmsmooth to pnmsmooth;
      tifftopgm to tifftopnm - new version based on Sam Leffler's libtiff.
    Bugfixes to pbmtoicon, ppmtops.
    The Makefiles now have a "merge" option.
    All flags are now case-insensitive.
    Added $(MAKE) stuff to Makefile.
    Changed pnmsmooth from a csh script to a sh script.
    Made macro use in pbmtox10bm and pbmtoxbm more portable.
    Moved compataliases to compat.csh, and added compat.ksh.
    Made ppmtoilbm less Amiga-specific.
    Added -headerskip and -rowskip flags to rawtopgm.
    Enhanced rasttopnm to interpret 8-bit rasters with no colormap as grayscale.
    Changed sscanf %g to %f - some systems can't handle %g on input.
    Added -expand flag to pbmmask.
    Speedup to pnmflip - don't buffer if possible.
    Added color-name-to-value routine to ppm - uses X11's rgb.txt if present.

    Removed picttopbm.
    Improved pnmcut argument syntax so that negative coords work like pnmpaste.
    Added "magic" file, for use with the "file" program.
    40% speedup for pgmnorm from Robert Stockton (rgs@cs.cmu.edu).
    Fixed long-standing bug involving colormaps on SPARCstations when
      compiled with gcc -- had to do with passing structs by value.
    Removed the -x flag from pnmtorast -- it's not really needed.
    Fixed subtle bug in the pnm reading code that caused pnmcat to blow
      it on images that differed greatly in width or height.
    New version of giftoppm that handles the GIF89a standard, and doesn't
      use fseek.
    Fixed fitstopgm to handle three-axis images, such as the Hubble pix.
    Xwdtopnm and pnmtoxwd finally handle byte-order properly.
    Added -xysize flag to pnmscale.
    Added conditional ANSI function prototypes to library routines.
    Added -noantialias flag to pnmrotate and pnmshear.
    Removed the TIPS file.  No one ever sent in any new tips, so I just
      moved the few I had into the relevant man pages.  That's probably
      where they belonged in the first place.
    Added justification flags to pnmcat.
    Added -map flag to ppmquant - user-specifiable colormap.  Also, the
      Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion finally works right.
    Added -map flag to pgmtoppm.
    Added DirectColor support to xwdtopnm and pnmtoxwd.
    Speedup to pgmtolj from Arthur David Olson: avoid sending whitespace.
    Fix to pbmtogo from Bo Thide': 2D compression now works.

Patch 1 to the X.V11R4 / comp.sources.misc distribution of 22nov89:

    Fixed bug in pgmtops -rle.

Changes since the alt.sources distribution of 13sep89:

    Small corrections to ppmtorast, pgmtops.
    Moved pbm/tifftopbm to pgm/tifftopgm - it now handles grayscale TIFF files.
    Fixed tifftopgm to handle non-native byte order.
    Changes to tifftopgm to handle bogus AppleScan TIFF files, to have
      better command syntax, and to use stdio.
    Optimizations to xbmtopbm, pbmtoxbm, and pbmtox10bm, courtesy of
      Juha Sarlin, to make them go about three times as fast.
    Optimization to pgmtops and ppmtops to make them go three times as fast.
    Optimization to pnmcrop.
    Added PBMPLUS_BROKENPUTC defines in pbmplus.h to handle systems (such as
      ULTRIX) which have broken putc() macros.
    Rewrote ppmscale, pnmcat, and pgmhist to operate line-by-line, instead
      of reading in the whole image.
    Rewrote pnmflip to keep only one copy of the image in memory.
    Added pgmtofits, courtesy of Wilson H. Bent, plus bugfixes to fitstopgm
      and a patch to giftoppm to handle black&white GIF files.
    Added picttopbm and rawtopgm.
    Fixes to xwdtoppm and ppmtoxwd so they compile with SunOS cc as well as gcc.
    Another small change to ppmtoxwd having to do with colormap size.
    Changed macptopbm's -headersize flag to be -extraskip.
    Changed tgatoppm to read color values as BGRA instead of ARGB; the Targa
      documentation is apparently wrong about the order.
    Some changes to the Makefiles, partially to work around bugs in gnumake.
    Got g3topbm working, and added pbmtog3, courtesy of Paul Haeberli.
    Added some pixrect work-alike code so that rasttopbm, pbmtorast, rasttoppm,
      and ppmtorast can be used on non-Sun systems.  This also provides a
      final solution to the persistent byte- and bit-order problems on 386's.
    Moved the SYSV-checking #ifdefs to *after* the include of pbm.h, which
      defines SYSV.
    Made all the #else's and #endif's ANSI-compliant.
    Added manual pages for libpbm, libpgm, libppm, and libpnm, courtesy
      of Tony Hansen.
    Changed man page installation so that pages from different sections
      can go in different directories.
    Fixed Imakefiles.

Changes since the expo.lcs.mit.edu FTP distribution of 06sep89:

    Added #ifdefs to pnm/libpnm3.c to allow the PBM-PNM-only configuration.
    Small corrections to TIPS, pnm/Makefile, pnm/Imakefile, ppm/ppmrotate.1,
      ppm/ppmshear.1, ppm/ppmtoilbm.c, pbm/xwdtopbm.c, ppm/xwdtoppm.c,
      ppm/ppmtoxwd.c, ppm/ppmtoxwd.1, pbm/x11wd.h.

Changes since the comp.sources.misc distribution of 31oct88:

    Added pbmreduce, pbmlife, pbmmask, and pbmupc.
    Added gemtopbm, tifftopbm, pcxtopbm, pbmtogo, mgrtopbm, pbmtomgr,
      cmuwmtopbm, pbmtocmuwm, g3topbm, and pbmtobg.
    Minor bugfix to pbmtolj.
    Slight restructuring of most of the programs to use vastly less memory.
    Various other minor optimizations.
    Fixed pbmtorast and rasttopbm to handle byte-swapped big-endian 386 boxes.
    Slight changes to argument syntax of pbmcrop, pbmmake, pbmreduce.
    Moved to the new PGM package: pbmtops (which now produces Conforming PS).
    Moved to the new PPM package: giftopbm.
    Moved to the new PNM package: pbmcrop pbmcut pbmenlarge pbminvert.
    Consolidated into a single pnmflip tool: pbmfliplr pbmfliptb pbmtrnspos.
    Consolidated into a single pnmcat tool: pbmcatlr pbmcattb.
    Added compataliases script for upward compatability with changed tools.
    Removed xxxtopbm.
    Added a -headersize flag to macptopbm, to help get around annoying
      problems in MacPaint file format.
    Added the RAWBITS compilation-time option, to use a more compact and
      much faster (but less portable) external format.
    Removed the CBM format - use compress(1) and / or RAWBITS instead.
    Pbmpaste (and the new pnmpaste) now accepts negative x and y coords,
      which are interpreted relative to the right and bottom sides.
    Changed all programs to accept a "-" file argument as meaning standard
      input.
    Removed pbmtox10wd, since it was never very useful (X10 doesn't have xwud).
    Added Imakefiles, for X11 types to use.

Changes since the X.V11R3 distribution of 31aug88:

    The cbm format has been revised to support run-length encoding.
    Pbmtops now does run-length encoding.

Major changes since the X.V11R2 distribution of 28mar88:

    The pbm format now has a "magic number".
    New conversion filters: brushtopbm, giftopbm, pbmtolj, pbmtomacp,
      pbmtoxwd, and pbmtox10wd.
    Icontopbm converter has a better parser -- it knows to skip over
      any extraneous comments at the beginning of the icon file.
    Pbmtops generates a different PostScript wrapper program -- it should
      handle huge bitmaps better.
    Xwdtopbm now handles byte-swapping correctly.
    Pbmmake takes a flag to specify the color of the new bitmap.
    Pbmpaste now implements 'or', 'and', and 'xor' operations as well
      as the default 'replace'.
