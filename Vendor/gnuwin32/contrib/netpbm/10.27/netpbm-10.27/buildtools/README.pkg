THESE ARE THE MANUAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR NETPBM

Most people install using the interactive install program 'installnetpbm'
that is in the top level directory of the Netpbm source tree.  But it 
isn't right for everyone.  If it doesn't do what you need, you can use
these instructions instead.


Once you have built and packaged Netpbm, installing is pretty
straighforward.  If you browse the package directory, you can probably
figure it out without reading any further.


The parts to be installed are:

  Executables 

    These are the basic Netpbm programs, such as 'jpegtopnm'.
    You will find these in the 'bin' subdirectory of the package directory.

    You normally want to copy all of these into a directory that is in your
    default program search path (which is controlled by your PATH 
    environment variable).  Typical directories for this are /bin, /usr/bin,
    and /usr/local/bin.

  Shared Library
         
    This is the library that all Netpbm programs need to load and link
    to at run time.  It is in the 'lib' subdirectory of the package
    directory.  Building a shared library is optional; if you didn't
    do it (which means you built executables that don't require it),
    you don't have a 'lib' subdirectory.  Shared libraries are also
    known as dynamic libraries and DLLs.

    You normally want to copy the shared library to a directory that
    is in your system's default shared library search path.  On
    systems that have an 'ldconfig' program, that program controls the
    shared library search path, and you must run it after copying the
    Netpbm shared library to its directory.  Often, simply rebooting
    will cause it to run cleanly.

    Typical directories for this are /lib, /usr/lib, and /usr/local/lib.

    On Windows, the DLLs are treated like executables, so you should
    find the 'lib' directory empty and you should find the Netpbm DLL
    in the 'bin' directory.  You'll probably want to install the DLL
    and the executables in the same directory, because the shared
    library and executable search paths are the same.

  Link Library

    This is a static link library.  You don't need it to run Netpbm.  You
    need it only if you want to build your own programs that use the Netpbm
    library.  It is in the 'link' subdirectory of the package directory.

    You normally want to copy the link library into a directory that is
    in the default search path of your linker.  Typical directories for 
    this are /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib.

  Interface Headers

    These are the files that declare the interface to the Netpbm 
    programming library.  You don't need them to run Netpbm.  You need
    them only if you want to build your own programs that use the
    Netpbm library.  They are in the 'include' subdirectory of the 
    package directory.

    You normally want to copy the interface header files into a directory
    that is in the default search path of your compiler.  Typical
    directories for this are /usr/include and /usr/local/include.

  Data Files

    These are files that you can use for various purposes as input to
    Netpbm programs.  People rarely have uses for them, actually.  They
    are in the 'data' subdirectory of the package directory.
   
    Put these somewhere that users will be able to find them.
    /usr/lib/netpbm and /usr/share/netpbm are typical choices.

  Man Pages

    Netpbm does not have the typical Unix form of documentation.  The
    documentation is not in files that you can read with the common
    'man' program.  Instead, it is in HTML form, and it is not in the
    package directory at all.  You must install it separately.

    But so that a user who is not familiar with Netpbm documentation
    doesn't find himself out in the cold with no access to
    documentation, the package directory contains traditional man
    pages that do nothing but tell you where to get the real
    documentation.  (Exactly where that is depends on the options with
    which you built and packaged Netpbm).  We call these "pointer man
    pages."  You will find these man pages in the 'man' subdirectory
    of the package directory.

    You should copy the contents of this directory wherever your 'man'
    program looks for man pages.  Typically, this is /usr/man, which
    has subdirectories equivalent to those in the package directory's
    'man' subdirectory.


    One of the Netpbm programs is Manweb, which is designed to be a
    replacement for the classic Man program that can access both
    traditional man pages and worldwide web documentation in the
    Netpbm style with the familiar 'man jpegtopnm' kind of command.
    To set up your system for this, you will have to be sure to create
    the /usr/man/web directory, with 'netpbm.url' in it.  Also, If you
    install Manweb as 'man', there is no point to installing the
    pointer man pages -- they will never be used.
    


The instructions above suggest putting the Netpbm parts in common
directories such as /usr/bin, mingled with other packages.  This is
usually the easiest way to get Netpbm working.  But also consider
putting all Netpbm parts in separate Netpbm directories, such as
/usr/bin/netpbm/ and /usr/link/netpbm.  In fact, you can just copy the
entire package directory in one piece to some place such as
/usr/local/netpbm.  You'll have to take care to set up search paths
and such to make this kind of configuration work.  The advantage of
keeping Netpbm separate is that it makes it easy to wipe out the
entire installation when you don't want it anymore, and to keep
multiple versions around.


netpbm.config
-------------

You should create a shell script named 'netpbm.config' out of the
template file 'config_template' in the package directory, and install
netpbm.config in your executable search path.  Programs that want to
find out where you installed some part of Netpbm can invoke
netpbm.config and it will tell them.  For example, a make file for a
program that uses the Netpbm programming library might use
netpbm.config to generate the necessary compiler and linker options to
access that library.

Using netpbm.config, it's possible to have a viable Netpbm
installation where netpbm.config is the only file in any default
search path.

The xxx.config file concept is a relatively new but growing convention,
seen mostly in software related to the X Window System.
