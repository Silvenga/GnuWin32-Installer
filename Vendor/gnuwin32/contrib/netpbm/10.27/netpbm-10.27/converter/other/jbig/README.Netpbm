The jbig tools are derived from the JBIG-KIT package by Marcus Kuhn,
by Bryan Henderson on 2000.05.11.

The file ANNOUNCE in this directory is from that package and gives
details.

The Netpbm tools jbigtopbm and pbmtojbig were adapted from JBIG-KIT's
jbgtopbm and pbmtojbg.  The main difference is that the Netpbm
versions use the Netpbm libraries.

The jbig.c and jbig_table.c modules are straight from the JBIG_KIT 
package.  They are what normally are packaged as libjbig.a.
