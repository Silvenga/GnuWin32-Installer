The code in the directory 'libjasper' is taken from the Jasper package.
In particular, from the 'src/libjasper' directory of Jasper Version
1.600.0.

The adaptation was done by Bryan Henderson on 2002.10.26.

The adaptation involved:

  - remove stuff for formats other than PNM.

  - Replace build stuff (Jasper uses GNU Autoconf/Automake/Libtool).
