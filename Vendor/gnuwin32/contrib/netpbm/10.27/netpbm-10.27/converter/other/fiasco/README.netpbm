The 'fiasco' subdirectory of the Netpbm source tree is primarily a copy
of the source distribution of the Fiasco package by Ullrich Hafner.
Bryan Henderson adapted fiasco-1.0 on July 6, 2000 to netpbm, and then
merged in all the updates from fiasco-1.3 on February 9, 2001.

The changes are:

- Uses Netpbm libraries for input and output of Netpbm format images.

- Works with maxvals other than 255 in Netpbm input images.  This change
  also makes a minor correction to the maxval 255 case.  Where the Fiasco
  package multiplies by 16 to convert from 8 bit to 12 bit intensity,
  the correct factor is 4095/255.

- Does not issue warning when system configuration file not found.
  The location of that file is a compile-time option in 'fiasco', but
  fixed at /etc in Netpbm.  The expectation is that Netpbm users will
  never have a system configuration file.

- Does not fail if basis file small.fco is not found.  The Fiasco code
  already contained facilities for defaulting to a built-in version of
  small.fco, but it was disabled by an early check for existence of
  the basis file as an actual file.  In Netpbm, that check for
  existence is simply removed.

- Remove WINDOWS config.h configuration macro, which determined whether
  files would be open with "b" flag (binary).  Use "b" flag unconditionally.

- Rename internal "log2" function to "Log2" to avoid conflict with existing
  "log2" macro or function.  The original package has conditional compilation
  to allow it to use the existing log2 when configured for a system that has
  it.  In Netpbm, we always use the private version.

- Compilation warnings fixed.

- 'bin' subdirectory moved to top level directory.

- man pages for programs moved from doc subdirectory to top level directory.

- man page of pnmpsnr created.
