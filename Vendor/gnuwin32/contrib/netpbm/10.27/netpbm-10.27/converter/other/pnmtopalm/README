This is version 1.0 of pnmpalm, netpbm converters for Palm pixmaps.

It's derived from version 1.0 of ppmtoTbmp.  The original 'ppmtoTbmp'
program has been renamed 'pnmtopalm', and has been rewritten to handle
the various bitmaps that exist as of PalmOS 3.5, and to handle
colormaps, a transparent color, and the various compression formats
recognized by Palm OS.  The 'Tbmptopnm' program is now 'palmtopnm',
and has been updated to handle the various newer bitmap formats as
well.  Man pages for 'pnmtopalm' and 'palmtopnm' have been added.  See
those man pages for more information.  Note that command-line switches
have changed.

As with Tbmptoppm, ppm images must be quantified properly before
being passed to pnmtopalm.  Several colormap files are provided to
use for this:
 - palmgray1.map -- 1-bit grayscale (i.e. monochrome)
 - palmgray2.map -- 2-bit grayscale
 - palmgray4.map -- 4-bit grayscale
 - palmcolor8.map -- 8-bit color, using the default color palette

The original ppmtoTbmp README read as follows:

This is version 1.0 of ppmtoTbmp, a ppm to Pilot bitmap converter.

To compile it, you'll need the netpbm package.  Last I checked, it was
available at "ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/netpbm-1mar1994.p1.tar.gz".
Change the Makefile to point to the directory that contains the netpbm
header files, and make.

Usage: ppmtoTbmp [-2bit] [file.ppm]

If the ppm file is not specified, one is read from stdin.  The -2bit option
produces a 2-bit bitmap instead of the normal 1-bit bitmap.  The ppm must
have at most 4 colours in it (for 2-bit) or at most 2 colours (for 1-bit).
Common invokations might be:

xbmtopbm icon.xbm | ppmquant -fs -map q2.map | ppmtoTbmp > tAIB03e8.bin
giftopnm image.gif | ppmquant -fs -map q4.map | ppmtoTbmp -2bit > Tbmp0bb8.bin

(q2.map and q4.map are trivial 2 and 4 colour maps, respectively, and are
included in this distribution.)

To include the resulting bitmap in a .prc file, just name the output
tAIB03e8.bin (for an application icon) or Tbmpxxxx.bin (for a form bitmap,
where xxxx is replaced by four hex digits giving the bitmap ID).

I'll probably make Tbmptopnm later, and put it in the 1.1 release.
