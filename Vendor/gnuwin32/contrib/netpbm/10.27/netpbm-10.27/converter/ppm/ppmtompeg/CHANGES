Changes chronology
------------------
1.5b Release	August 1995
	- added date to default USER_DATA string
	- made prototypes happier
	- renamed SPECIFICS_FILE to CDL_FILE
	- fixed bit_rate param in constrained param setting (was too restrictive)
	- fixed obscure P-block motion vector bug
	- added a file name replication:
	    foo.ppm  [1-10] will make 10 copies of foo.ppm
	- generalized fopen calls to specify binary mode (MSDOG)
	- generalized times calls into elapsed_time to handle different library routines
	- fixed motion vector bug in bframes; skip block bug
	- fixed minor bugs in parallel, mpeg, main, iframe, param, ....
	- accepts extra whitespace at the end of lines in parameter files
	- "PIXEL FULL" bug in B-frames fixed (caused ghosting)
        - B-blocks "can I skip" rutine now looks at color too (more ghosting problems)
        - switched from JPEG4 to JPEG5 (if they crash for you,
                  do a -DJPEG4 for the encoder, and get jpeg4.tar.gz off our site)
        - combine server (parallel) waits longer for files to exist (
                         thanks to apian@ise.fhg.de)
	- killing the parallel server kills the clients!!!! (apian@ise.fhg.de)

= BUG FIXES
	- removed SetBlocksPerSlice() from GOPStoMPEG
	- don't access bb after freeing
	- non-integer frame rates now work for all machines
	- fixed parsing of -mv_histogram
	- fixed numPadding bug (file name problem)
	- fixed full pixel assertation bug
        - corrected ASPECT_RATIO bug (was forced to 1)

        - complains when file is too small
	- fixed bug with non-ranged INPUT_FILE names

	- Actually evaluates the constrained parameter settings
	- fixed a Cr/Cb mixup in bframe.c

= NEW FEATURES
	- rate control
	- optional B search range different from P range
	- can read images from stdin, allowing encoding on-the-fly
        - Does Y files (no U or V)
	- New way of specifying files `cmd`, like `ls jan-*-94`
	- Can encode Abekas and Phillips style YUV formats
	- gamma correction
	- added -realquiet mode
	- JMOVIE and JPEGv4 input format fully supported
        - -float_dct uses the (slower) double precision floating point DCT 
	- automatically identifies itself in (sequence header) userdata
	- enforced [0][0] entry of Intra Q-table to be 8
	- added Jim Boucher's resize code
        - added -mse flag to print mean squared error on a per-block basis
	- can specify Sequence header user data
        - prints version number
        - finds more skip blocks in GenBFrame
	- can generate multiple sequence headers (every N GOPs)

= SPEED IMPROVEMENTS


= MAINTENANCE
	- removed mpeg_jrevdct_sparse(), since it wasn't used
	- added CompileTests();
	- uses libpnmrw rather than entire pbmplus directory
        - redid RCS
        - reorganized [ipb]frame.c to make playing with rate controls easier

= PORTABILITY
	- added #ifdef's, #ifndef's LINUX'es to ease porting
