Pbmtoppa was integrated into the Netpbm package in May 2000 by Bryan
Henderson.  He took it from Tim Norton's pbm2ppa-0.8.6 package dated
October 1998.

Tim licenses the subject package to the public as described in the
LICENSE file.

The difference between what's in Netpbm and what was distributed by 
Tim is:

  - Tim called it 'pbm2ppa' Netpbm calls it 'pbmtoppa', to fit Netpbm
    naming conventions.

  - Tim's package included the program Pbmtpg, but the Netpbm directory
    doesn't include that.  The program was integrated separately into
    Netpbm as Pbmpage.

  - Tim's package generated 3 different versions of Pbmtoppa, one for
    each of the 720, 820 or 1000 printer models.  (They only differed
    in their default parameters).  The netpbm version has only one
    Pbmtoppa, and the (existing) -v option selects defaults for the 
    specified printer model.

  - Tim didn't have a man page.  His package had several other
    documentation files, though, which are not in the Netpbm package
    because the information is either specific to Tim's packaging or
    the information in in the Netpbm man page.

  - Jozsef Marak's extension to handle draft (300 dpi) printing is 
    included.
