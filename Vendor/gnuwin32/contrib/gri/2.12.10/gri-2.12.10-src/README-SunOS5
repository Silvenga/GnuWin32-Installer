What Gri is
===========

 Gri is a language for scientific graphics applications.  By 'language'
 I mean that it is a command-driven application, as opposed to a
 click/point application.  It is analogous to latex or tex, and shares
 the property that extensive power is the reward for tolerating a
 modest learning curve.  Gri output is in industry-standard PostScript,
 suitable for incorporation in documents prepared by various text
 processors.

 Gri can make x-y graphs, contour-graphs, and image graphs.  In
 addition to high-level capabilities, it has enough low-level
 capabilities to allow users to achieve a high degree of customization.
 Precise control is extended to all aspects of drawing, including
 line-widths, colors, and fonts.  Text includes a subset of the tex
 language, so that it is easy to incorporate Greek letters and
 mathematical symbols in labels.
