Developing Gri was made easier by suggestions and bug reports from
many users, among whom are: Ivo Alxneit, Karin Bryan, Sara Bennett,
Luke Blaikie, Dave Brickman, Clyde Clements, Pierre Flament, Peter
Galbraith, Dave Hebert, Alejandro López-Valencia, Kawamura Masao,
Steve Matheson, Ed Nather, Carl Osterwisch, Richard Andrew Miles
Outerbridge, Brian May, Jinyu Sheng, Toru Suzuki, Keith Thompson,
David Trueman, and George White.

Some of these folks also suggested detailed improvements to the C++
code of Gri, not an easy task given the complexity and length of the
code.

Throughout Gri development, Peter Galbraith has been a steady partner
and advisor.  Gri, in its present open-source form, would not exist
without Peter.

All of these, and many users with whom I've interacted over the years,
I thank warmly.
