If you are reading this file, it means you are trying to build and
install Gri.  The method for this depends on how you got the Gri
source.

CASE 1: (gri sources that came from a "tarball")
    To build and intall from a "tarball", do this:
        ./configure
        make
        make check
        make install

    If you wish to control the location in which Gri is installed, use a
    "prefix" command at the configure stage, e.g.
        ./configure --prefix=/opt

    There are also some special flags; read the configure.ac file to
    learn about them.  One that the author is working on lately
    is exemplified
        --enable-OSX_BUNDLE
    which is used to cause Gri to look for gri.cmd in the same directory
    as the executable.  This is the first step to a proper OSX bundle.
    Later on


CASE 2: (gri sources from the "CVS" server at http://gri.sourceforge.net)
    Do the following:
        automake
        autoconf
    to create the "configure" file.  Then follow the same procedure as
    in Case 1.
