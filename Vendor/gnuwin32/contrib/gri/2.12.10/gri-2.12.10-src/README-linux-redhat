What Gri is
===========

Gri is a programming language for scientific graphics.  It can make
x-y graphs, contour-graphs, and image graphs.  In addition, Gri has a
full suite of low-level graphical elements and sufficient programming
capabilities (loops, subroutines, etc) to permit complex
customization.

Gri is not point-click.  In some ways it is analogous to TeX.
Extensive power rewards tolerance of a modest learning curve.

For the rest of this document, the symbol "N.N.N" will be taken to
stand for the Gri version number, e.g. N.N.N might represent the
version numbered 2.6.0, say.


Obtaining Gri for RedHat
========================

Follow the links at
    http://gri.sourceforge.net
to get an RPM package, and then install it by doing
    rpm -U gri-N.N.N-1.i386.rpm
The source is also available as a gzipped tarfile and as an RPN source
file.

The package provides a cursory manpage, available by typing
    man gri
at the unix prompt; the main documentation is available in "info"
format, by typing
    info gri
at the unix prompt (or through access by emacs or other facilities).
Many users will find it easier to study the HTML version of the
documentation, available at the local URL
    /usr/share/doc/gri-N.N.N/html/index.html
