What Gri is
===========

 Gri is a language for scientific graphics applications.  By 'language'
 I mean that it is a command-driven application, as opposed to a
 click/point application.  It is analogous to latex or tex, and shares
 the property that extensive power is the reward for tolerating a
 learning curve.  Gri output is in PostScript, suitable for 
 incorporation in documents prepared by various text processors.

 Gri can make x-y graphs, contour-graphs, and image graphs.  In
 addition to high-level capabilities, it has enough low-level
 capabilities to allow users to achieve a high degree of customization.
 Control is extended to all aspects of drawing, including
 line widths, colors, and fonts.  Text includes a subset of the tex
 language for letters and mathematical symbols in labels.


Compiling and Installing Gri
============================
 
The normal case is to have received the Gri source as a so-called
"tarball".  If that is how you got Gri, then you should type
	./configure
	make
	make install
at the shell to create and install Gri.  

A less common case is to have received Gri from the CVS server.  This
is the method used by co-developers or packagers, and also by folks
who are testing pre-release versions.  In this case, you need to type
	aclocal
	autoconf
	automake
first to create some configuration files, and then you type
	./configure
	make
	make install
as usual.
