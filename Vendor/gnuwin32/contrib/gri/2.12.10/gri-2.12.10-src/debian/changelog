gri (2.12.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    Bug Fixes:
    - Fix Debian Bug #348351 (PostScript file contained private
       information.  This was fixed by adding new commandline arguments
       `-private' and `-no_private', the former of which (the new default)
       means to not include the user's name, the invocation arguments, or the
       command-file contents. Thanks to Falk Hueffner for reporting it
       (Closes: #348351).
    - Fix SourceForge bug #1285180 (NaN was mishandled.  The bug may have
       arisen in version 2.12.7 or thereabouts.)
    - Fix SourceForge bug #1217273 (missing some version numbers within docs)
    - Fix SourceForge bug #1196613 (user-supplied x-axis labels can run
       offscale)

      of last argument(s)) (Closes: #290101)
    - Fix SourceForge bug #835711 (`draw gri logo' fails)
    - Fix SourceForge bug #1098269 (problem compiling on AMD64 machine.
      Solution provided by Andreas Jochens, a Debian user.  This moves a fix
      into the upstream source, rather than patching in diff.gz)
    - Fix SourceForge bug #867515 (problem with junk appearing in images.)
    - Fix SourceForge bug #875881 (problem compiling with gcc 2.95.3 compiler)

    - Add 'set clip to curve' command.
    - Add 'group' and 'end group' commands, in preparation for SVG
      output.  So far these commands do nothing, and are basically just a

     2.8.5-2.
  * Various debian directory tweaks merged-in from CVS:
  * Updated to Standards-Version 3.5.6 (debian/rules uses build-arch and
    build-indep targets).  
  * debian/rules: Use DH_COMPAT=3 (so that Emacs startup file under
    /etc/emacs get tagged as conffiles automatically)
    (closes: #132834, #132840);

    byte-compilation doesn't load Debian startup files under /etc/emacs.

    and move potato version of /etc/emacs startup file to .dpkg-old

  * debian/gri-html-doc.emacsen-startup: /usr/doc -> /usr/share/doc

gri (2.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
     New command syntax:
     - Add `unlink' command as a unix-familiar way to delete files.
     - Add `set page size' command to clip to a given page size.
     - Add `substr' RPN operator to permit extraction of sub-strings.
     - Add `default' for the `set x name' and the `set y name' commands.
     - Add Perl-like ability to put underscores in numerical constants
        (`.v. = 1_000' and `.v. = 1000' are completely equivalent).
     Emacs mode:
     - <M-Tab> completes builtin variables and synonyms as well as commands.
     - "idle-timer help" displays defaults for builtin variables under cursor.
     - fontification of builtin variables _only_ if spelled correctly.
     Developer changes:
     - Add `make source-arch-indep' target in sources.  This will build a
       source tar file in which all the architecture-independent material
       (documentation in HTML, postscript and Info formats) is pre-made.
       This makes it easier to install gri on a host that doesn't have
       TeX and ImageMagick installed.
  * Move gri-html-doc and gri-ps-doc documentation files to /usr/share/doc/gri
  * Complies with Standards-Version: 3.5.5 without changes.

gri (2.4.2-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. ** Bug Fixes Only; No new features **
    - Remove bug in which `convert grid to image' produced incorrect
      images, visible as a patchy appearance with coarse grids.
    - Remove bug in which `convert image to grid' failed to take note of
      the gri minimum and maximum, so that contouring of the grid was not
      possible for grids created from images.
