gri for DEBIAN
--------------

 Here is how the packages are organized:

  gri:  
        gri binary, manual in Info format, the Emacs mode (gri-mode.el), 
        and one-page reference cards in PostScript format.

        For help about the software, see the Info manual:

          $ info gri

  gri-html-doc: 
        HTML version of the manual (It's listed in dwww, dhelp and 
        doc-central if you have the doc-base package installed).

        This manual is available on the web via:
          http://gri.sourceforge.net/gridoc/html/

        Once you have installed this package, it's available at the URL
          http://localhost/doc/gri/html/
        if you have a web server (like apache), or more simply at 
          file:/usr/share/doc/gri/html/index.html

  gri-ps-doc: 
        PostScript version of the manual suitable for printing.

        Once you have installed this package, it's available at
          /usr/share/doc/gri/gri.ps.gz

  The Gri cookbook (for real-world examples) on the web at:

Packages available outside of Debian for older Gri versions:

 Some packages may be available outside the scope of Debian official
 packages that provide binaries for specific versions of Gri.  This is
 useful if you write a complicated Gri command and find it no longer works
 after a Gri version upgrade. You may then want to install a
 version-specific package which contains only the binary and library of the
 Gri version you need.

 For example, if you currently use a package named gri_VSN-1.deb, and
 upgrade to gri_LATERVSN-1.deb, you could also install the package
 gri-VSN_VSN-1.deb (Note how the version number appears twice).  The
 package name is thus `gri-VSN' instead of `gri'.  This package would
 provide the version-specific command `gri-VSN', also accessible inside of
 Emacs' gri-mode (see the Emacs command `gri-set-local-version').
 Statically compiled version are also available named like gri-VERSIONstatic.

 Some i386 (and perhaps other arches) version-specific packages are
 available from:

  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5511

 Or compile your own!  (Install the source package and read
 debian/00Porters.readme)
