Comments regarding the Package:

 THIS PACKAGE IS NOT PART OF DEBIAN, but it is created from the same
 source, .diff and .dsc files.

 This package exists to live alongside a newer release of the regular gri
 package, providing backwards compatibility for your old code that may
 depend on this version of Gri.
