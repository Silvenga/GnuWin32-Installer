* A2Ps-4.14 for Windows *
=========================

What is it?
-----------
A2Ps: format files for printing on a PostScript printer

Description
-----------
GNU a2ps is an Any to PostScript filter. Of course it processes plain text files, but also pretty prints quite a few popular languages. Its slogan is precisely `` Do The Right Thing '', which means that though it is highly configurable, everything was made so that a novice user can do complicated PostScript manipulations. For instance, it has the ability to delegate the processing of some files to other filters (such as groff, texi2dvi, dvips, gzip etc.), what allows a uniform treatment (n-up, page selection, duplex etc.) of heterogeneous files. It supports a wide number of encodings, and a very good handling of Latin 2-6 should be noted, thanks to Ogonkify (by Juliusz Chroboczek). Needed fonts are automatically downloaded. The interface is internationalized, the output is customizable and there are as many options as users had wishes (table of content, headings, virtual page layout etc. etc.). The format used is nice and compact: normally two pages on each physical page, borders surrounding pages, headers with useful information (page number, printing date, file name or supplied header), line numbering, pretty-printing, symbol substitution etc.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in a2ps-4.14-1-GnuWin32.diffs in a2ps-4.14-1-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
