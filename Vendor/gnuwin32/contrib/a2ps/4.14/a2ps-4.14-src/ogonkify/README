                  Composite fonts and Ogonkify

This package contains two programs: a utility for creating composite
fonts in a semi-automatic fashion, and a program for converting PS
output -- notably Netscape and Mosaic output -- to use these fonts.
It has been tested with Netscape Navigator 1.1N, 2.02, 3.0 beta 4,
3.01 and 4.04 and Mosaic 2.7b1, all of those under Unix.

Installation instructions are provided in the file `INSTALL'.

Extensive documentation is provided in the `doc/' subdirectory.  The
interesting files are:

    doc/ogonkify.man           the ogonkify(1) man page
    doc/ogonkify.info          the full manual, including installation
                               instructions and the license

Both of these can be treated like plain text files, although the
latter is really an Info file (best viewed in an Info viewer, such as
the one in GNU Emacs).
