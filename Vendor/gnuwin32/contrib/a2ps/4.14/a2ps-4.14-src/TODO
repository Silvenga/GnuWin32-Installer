Here is a list of things we would like to do, but that we don't have
time to.  This means that the contributions are really hoped!  We
already have some ideas on many nice new features, please get into
contact with us to participate!

   17 - Generate LaTeX. This is mostly useful when someone has to
	include pieces of code inside his/her text.
   21 - Word wrap option.
   42 - Too large water marks, title fonts etc.
  119 - Finish other non printables (extract escaping from ps?)
  137 - Undefined meta sequences in toc (total num of pages).
  138 - Make the encodings hash their fonts too.  This will avoid
	unnecessary re-reencoding.
  149 - Metrics of encoding support by a font.
  154 - Split the distrib in two parts.
  158 - Complete the delegation to a2ps.
  162 - makefont for Graham.
  163 - --error=abort, best, fail.
  177 - Improve match_sequence? (Too slow)
  182 - The handling of mail should not be done through .ssh,
	but by a real bison/yacc parser.  MIME support should of course
	be a major issue.  Delegation should work on included documents.
  190 - Document ppd
  195 - Document Expand:, %dnl, %DefaultVariable:
  201 - In addition to delegations, introduce filters?
        They'd pipe into a2ps instead of calling another time (e.g. .gz).
  206 - Make the report ("sent to default printer" etc.) be an escaped string.
  210 - Complete the doc on the new variables.
  211 - Caution with alloca in routines.h in a bison stuff.
  212 - Doc: Add "stats" to -v
  213 - Doc: describe the new rules for -E and sheets.map
  216 - Doc: new escapes.
  217 - Finish FILE_LAST_SHEET_DUPLEX etc.
  218 - Doc: FAQ the disparition of `Medium:'
  221 - included debugging messages (in the PS) should be in English.
  223 - Document better Tag1... (in writing a ssh)
  225 - Document scripting with a2ps.
  227 - Document and --help `--language'.
  231 - Rewrite pathwalk with more glibc routines.  Or even better: kpathsea.
  233 - repair --margin
  234 - Use AVL instead of adhoc treatment for P-rules. See libavl.
  235 - split the library sources using libtool's convenience libs
  236 - split a libppd?
  237 - Write a test for quoting.
  242 - Finish importing libpaper from 4.10
  243 - Try to remove useless lines from the output.
  244 - Find a scheme to enable setpagedevice on psnup-delegated jobs.
  245 - More fine grained sheets.map.  e.g. dvi:delegate, junk:binary
  246 - Keep room for comments?
  247 - a2ps the prog should have its own file table.
  248 - Make the report (sent to default printer etc.) be an escaped string.
  257 - fortran fixed style line end
  258 - Extend ssh to handle line continuation.
  262 - fixps: There should be a way to check the pairs Begin/End
  265 - Specify the default of -C by var?
  269 - Extend fixps so that it can also check the ps with GS.
  270 - Running gs to check encoding.ps is really needed.
  271 - Introduce more means to insert PS code at various points.
  272 - Document Mixed style sheets.
  273 - When a delegation fails, and is ignored, a2ps should report
 	that nothing is printed, instead  `Printed 0 sheets'.
  274 - file(1) should be called only once with all the files, to avoid
	the overhead of launching it for *each* file.  Yeah, I know it's
	a stupid thing to have done it this way :(.
  277 - Try to avoid useless work (be as lazy as you can, don't pre-read
	encodings, prologues etc.).
  280 - Modernize the ioctl handling.
  282 - Use Jim Meyering's hash.[ch] instead of hashtab.[ch] when possible.
  287 - -s1 should emit -SDuplex:false.  Introduce also -s0 for nothing?
  289 - There is a problem with --strip: it should kill comment lines
        when they're *empty*, but leave the newline if there were yet things
        printed on that line.
  290 - Provide more formats for the docs.
  291 - lex++.ssh
  292 - Allow `+' in sheets' key?
  294 - Give a means to compute the ssh-index of an installed a2ps.
  297 - MAKEINSTALLDIRS is wrong in libintl/.
  298 - Make -s1 really issue -SDuplex:false.
  299 - bison: there is a problem with const.
  300 - More user friendly get_integer, get_floats etc.  Write tests.
  305 - Document Euro
  306 - --list=var and others should be able to report the origin
        of the definitions.
  307 - There is a conflict between underlays and matrix.  Matrix should
        be honored first.
  311 - Extend argmatch to also handle numeric arguments.
        Once done, give a better error message for -Atoto.
  312 - It is abnormal than one has to give \2 when she means \1
        in the case of `keywords are...'.
  314 - List the features in the man pages.
  315 -

And a lot of cleanups :(
