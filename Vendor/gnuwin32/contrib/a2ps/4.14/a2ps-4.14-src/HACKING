This file attempts to describe the rules to use when hacking A2ps.
Don't put this file into the distribution.  Don't mention it in the
ChangeLog.

Everything related to the development of A2ps is on Savannah:

* Administrivia

** If you incorporate a change from somebody on the net:
First, if it is a large change, you must make sure they have signed
the appropriate paperwork.  Second, be sure to add their name and
email address to THANKS.

** If a change fixes a test, mention the test in the ChangeLog entry.

** Bug reports
If somebody reports a new bug, mention his name in the ChangeLog entry
and in the test case you write.  Put him into THANKS.

The correct response to most actual bugs is to write a new test case
which demonstrates the bug.  Then fix the bug, re-run the test suite,
and check everything in.


* Hacking

** Visible changes
Which include serious bug fixes, must be mentioned in NEWS.

** Translations
Only user visible strings are to be translated: error messages, bits
of the .output file etc.  This excludes impossible error messages
(comparable to assert/abort), and all the --trace output which is
meant for the maintainers only.


* Test suite

** make check
Use liberally.

** Release checks
Try to run the test suite with more severe conditions before a
release:

- Change tests/atlocal/CFLAGS to add your preferred options.  For
  instance, `-traditional' to check that the parsers are K&R.  Note
  that it does not make sense for glr.c, which should be ANSI,
  but currently is actually GNU C, nor for lalr1.cc, which anyway is
  not exercised yet in the test suite.


* Release Procedure

** Tests
See above.

** Update the foreign files
Running `make update' in the top level should make it all for you.
This covers PO files too.  Beware that it happens that some PO files
contain serious problems and are rejected by recent Gettext releases:
fix them all, and complain to the Translation Project!

Note that there might be *new* PO files.  Don't forget to update the
whole machinery, which not only includes LINGUAS, but `cvs add'ing the
PO files too.

** Update NEWS
The version number, *and* the date of the release (including for
betas).

** Update ChangeLog
Should have an entry similar to `Version 1.49b.'.
Check all this in once `make distcheck' passes.

** make alpha
Running `make alpha' is absolutely perfect for beta releases: it makes
the tarballs, the xdeltas, and prepares (in /tmp/) a proto
announcement.  It is so neat, that that's what I use anyway for
genuine releases, but adjusting things by hand (e.g., the urls in the
announcement file, the ChangeLog which is not needed etc.).

If it fails, you're on your own...

It requires GNU Make.

** Upload
Put the tarballs/xdeltas where they should be.  Or put it somewhere,
and send the URL to ftp-upload@gnu.org.

** Bump the version number
In configure.ac.  Run `make', check this in.

** Announce
Complete/fix the announcement file, and send it at least to
info-gnu@gnu.org (if a real release, or a ``serious beta''),
a2ps@gnu.org, and translation@iro.umontreal.ca.

Send the same announcement on the comp.compilers newsgroup.  Do not
make any Cc as the moderator will throw away anything cross-posted or
Cc'ed.  It really needs to be a separate message.
