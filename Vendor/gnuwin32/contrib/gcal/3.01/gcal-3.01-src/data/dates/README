These date files were derived from USENET postings of special events.
See the CREDITS file for more details.

All dates in these files are New Style unless otherwise noted.

To use any of these files with the calentool program, add a line of the form:
	#include "/somepath/file"
or
	#include <file>
to your ".appointments" file.  The first method specifies the complete
pathname to the desired file.  The second prepends the file name with
a pathname determined from the CalenTool/LibDir entry in the suntools
defaults file (first), or from the path specified by DATELIB_DIR
defined in the Makefile or ct.h file (second).

If you add dates to these files, or create new ones, share your entries
with the net by mailing a copy to me.  PLEASE be CERTAIN that you have the
correct rule for specifying the date before you do this; remember that
not all holidays fall on the same Gregorian date each year!
