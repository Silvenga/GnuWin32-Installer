The dates in these files cam from many sources.  Amoung them are:
"Today in History" - a online file of special events in world history,
maintained by Robert Heckendorn at Hewlett-Packard in Fort Collins, Colorado
(robert@fc.hp.com); ProLine's "Today" file, submitted by Larry Virden;
and net postings by Rich Kulawiec (see below).
Most of the original derivation and formatting was done by R.P.C. Rodgers
(at UCSF).  Others were formatted by Larry W. Virden and edited by me.
I merged the various sources to produce the final result.

There were many cases where the different sources showed different dates
for the same event. Where I could, I used my "World Almanac and Book of
Facts" (1988 ed.) to resolve the conflict.  In a few cases, both dates
are shown.  If you spot an error or have a definitive reference for the
correct date where multiple listings are shown, please notify me.

Subject: More dates for "calentool"
Status: OR


I don't know about other people who submitted calendar entries, but I know that
a lot of the items in "popcult" [now split in "lives" and "music"],
among others, are from a long typing session
that I put in a few years ago with a couple of my favorite rock-n-roll
references.  I'd be happier, and I imagine that the other people who typed in
other dates at some length would be happier, if credit was given where due.

The enclosed news article lists people who contributed to the 1985 calendar
(which was posted to Usenet); I started with that and added 300-400 dates,
mostly involving pop culture, before re-posting the whole mess later.

Cheers,
Rich Kulawiec
