NEWS file for `gcal'.

User-visible changes.

Current Version: 3.01
See the HISTORY file for the details of all changes.


Major changes in release 3.01

* Some minor changes in the `doc/LL/texi/gcal.texi' documentation (fixed some
    typos and extended the manuals with description text for the new options).
* Now, text variable references like `$[FORMAT]TVAR TEXT' at the beginning
    of a Gcal resource file are expanded correctly if the contents of the
    TVAR that is used with the FORMAT instruction results in a *valid* Gcal
    date-part, that may be used in a resource file line.
* Now, the `--execute-command' option also works correctly for global text
    variable assignments like `-r$a?echo $HOME' or `-r$b:expr 2 + 2 2>&1' if
    it is written *before* such a text variable option in the command line
    (Sorry, it still does not work if it is given *behind* such a text
    variable option in the command line).
* Changed behavior of Gcal in terms how it choses the default style of
    year calendar sheets if the `--type' option is used.
* Now, the `--grouping-text[=TEXT]' option also recognizes a '^'-CARET
    character for line break-up, global $TVAR references and `%?'...
    special texts that are used for text replacement.
* New `--heading-text=TEXT' option that can be used to create a self-defined
    title text for the fixed date list.  The TEXT argument may contain
    '~'-TILDE and '^'-CARET characters for line break-up, global $TVAR
    references and `%?'... special texts that are used for text replacement.
* Changed layout of Coypright texts to improve the legal clearness.

Major changes in release 3.00
* Some major changes in the `doc/LL/texi/gcal.texi' documentation.
* Changed my old and momentary (20000527) recent <esken@uni-muenster.de>
    eMail address to <esken@gmx.net>, because I do not know for how long
    my old address will remain valid.  At any case, the <esken@gmx.net>
    eMail account will hopefully be available for a long time.
* Changed <bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org> eMail address to <bug-gcal@gnu.org>.
* The new `--cycle-end=ARG' and `--cycle-step=ARG' options can be used for
    flexibly displaying a table of astronomical %sun* and %moon* special text
    times and data within a given time interval that is valid for a single day.
    If the `--cycle-end=ARG' option is given, the argument of the
    `--time-offset' option serves as the CYCLE-START value!
* Changed behavior of ``empty'' text variables TVAR,
    which are not displayed AS-IS anymore if referenced.
* New `--adjust-value=ARG' option for setting a user-defined rise/set-based
    reference altitude which is respected by the %sun* and %*moon special
    texts, respectively, the shadow length factor that is respected by the
    %sun* special texts.
* New `--atmosphere=ARG' option for setting the air pressure and temperature,
    which are the main values to calculate the actual amount of atmospheric
    refraction that is respected by some times and data of the %sun* and
    %moon* special texts.  If the air pressure argument is set to a value
    less equal zero, the %sun* and %moon* special texts do not correct some
    times and data by the amount of atmospheric refraction.
* The new `misc/mrms/*' files can be used to display the times at which
    moonset/moonrise has happened in the past resp., will happen in the
    future, based on the actual local time for several geographic locations
    around the world.
* Added new `data/bkk.rc', `data/ms.rc', `data/de-mdata.rc',
    `data/de-sdata.rc', `data/mdata.rc', `data/sdata.rc' and
    `data/sun-moon.rc' demonstration resource files.

Major changes in release 2.50 (inofficial alpha testing release)
* Added four new `%?[ARG]' "special texts with other argument" for displaying
    moonrise, moonset, Moon's day length and Moon's night length approximately
    (%(, %), %[ and %]).
* Changed behavior of the `--starting-day' and `--type' options, which
    do not implicitly enable a month calendar sheet anymore.
* If the date given as an argument to the `--gregorian-reform' option is
    beyond the actual (Gregorian) system date, the actual (Gregorian) system
    date and a date which is given by the actual date modifier %DATE will be
    automatically converted to the proper proleptic Julian calendar date now.
* The maximum year number which may be given as an argument to the
    `--gregorian-reform' option is 10002 now.  So it is possible to
    calculate proleptic Julian calendars likewise Chinese/Japanese
    calendar holidays/months until 31-Dec-9999.
* Changed behavior when analyzing the NLS $LANGUAGE, $LC_* and $LANG i18n
    environment variables.  Any of these environment variables which are
    defined, but have an empty value, are unrespected now.
* Removed a bug that occurred when display time values, and that time values
    like `11:60' are now correctly displayed as `12:00'.
* New `--precise' option for displaying the precise, non-rounded, data and
   times of the %sun*, %moon* and %distance special text.
* New `--limit' option for displaying only the sunrise and sunset times of the
    %sun* special text which appear on the actual day.
* Added 273 new countries/territories, which can be accessed by using
    the `--cc-holidays=CC[+CC+...]' option.
* New `--time-offset=ARG' option for setting a time offset value added,
    which is respected by
    `--astronomical-holidays' (Moon phase, solar and lunar eclipse,
    equinox, solstice),
    `--zodiacal-marker-holidays',
    `--celtic-holidays',
    `--chinese-flexible-holidays',
    `--chinese-flexible-months',
    `--japanese-flexible-holidays',
    `--japanese-flexible-months' and
    `--multicultural-new-year-holidays'.
    So it is possible to calculate such astronomically based events based on
    localtime instead of UT/GMT only.  Works also for the %sun* and %moon*
    special texts.
* New `--bahai-months' option for including the Bahai calendar months
    into the eternal holiday list added.

* New `--persian-jalaali-months' option for including the Persian ``Jalaali''
    calendar months into the eternal holiday list added.
* New `--astronomical-holidays' option for including some astronomical data
    (Moon phase, equinox, solstice) into the eternal holiday list added.

    holidays of Orthodox Churches.
* When using an external pager via $PAGER environment variable,
    possible command line arguments stored there are passed now.
* Changed option `--mail=ADDRESS' to `--mail[=ADDRESS]'.  If no ADDRESS is
    specified, use contents of $MAILTO as ADDRESS.  If $MAILTO is not set,
    use contents of $USER as ADDRESS.  If $USER is not set, use contents of
    $LOGNAME as ADDRESS.  If $LOGNAME is not set, do not send eMail.
* New text variable assignment `TVAR?COMMAND' implemented, which assigns that
    text to TVAR --interpreted by Gcal--, which is created by the COMMAND on
    the STDOUT channel.  This kind of assigment is performed only in case the
    `--execute-command' option is given.
* New text variable assignment `TVAR:COMMAND' implemented, which assigns that
    text to TVAR --uninterpreted by Gcal--, which is created by the COMMAND on
    the STDOUT channel.  This kind of assigment is performed only in case the
    `--execute-command' option is given.
* Removed the highlighting from the help screens and changed the layout of
    the basic help screen (`--help' option).
* Removed fixed date modifier [B] (== `--bypass-shell-command') completely
    but added `--execute-command' instead, which is set to FALSE by default
    for safer program execution.
* Changed the file searching mechanism for resource, response, and user
    included files, and that searching by using the GCALPATH environment
    variable is done prior before searching by using the HOME environment
    variable.
* Added `doc/mksamp.in' and the SED scripts `mks1sed.in' (expanded to
    `mksamp-1.sed'), and `mks2sed.in' (expanded to `mksamp-2.sed') for
    generating Texinfo files from the `doc/LL/examples/*.in' examples template
    files ready to include into the `doc/LL/texi/gcal.texi' documentation.
* Added all example resource files from the Gcal Texinfo reference manual
    to the `doc/LL/examples/' subdirectories.
* A '-' character leading one of the `%?' "special texts without any argument"
    (`%[FORMAT]y', `%[FORMAT]m', `%[FORMAT]w' and `%[FORMAT]d') switches the
    sign of the computed value.
* Renamed the Gcal supported environment variable LINES to GCAL_LINES,
    COLUMNS to GCAL_COLUMNS, LI to LINES and CO to COLUMNS.

    files which contain the day/night lengths and differences for all days
    of the year for any location around the world.
* Added new `data/birthday', `data/wloc.rc', `data/wtt1.rc', `data/wtt2.rc'
    and `data/wtt3.rc' demo resource files.

* By reason of implementing the optional format instruction 
    which can be used by many special texts in the text part of
    a resource file line now, some of these special texts are
    obsolete now and are changed to:

* Implemented an optional format instruction, which can be used by many
    special texts `%?'... and all text variables TVAR. Its template is:
    [ ALIGNMENT [SIGN] [LZERO] WIDTH [SUFFIX] FORMAT ]
    (must be given in above mentioned order), e.g., `$:+010&#a' or `%>20&*Y'.
    ALIGNMENT: < == adjusts field contents at the left margin
                    using width WIDTH.
               : == adjusts field contents in centered manner
                    using width WIDTH.
               > == ajdusts field contents at the right margin
                    using width WIDTH.
    SIGN     : + == a numerical value is always lead by its sign.
    LZERO    : 0 == a numerical value is filled up to WIDTH leading zeroes
                    inclusivly a possibly leading explicit SIGN or an
                    implicitly leading negative sign..
    WIDTH    : N == is the width N of the field (1...256).
    STYLE    : u == converts field contents to upper-case letters.
               l == converts field contents to lower-case letters.
               w == converts field contents to capitalized words.
    SUFFIX   : & == a numerical value is provided with
                    an ordinal number suffix.
    FORMAT   : * == does not cut the field contents after position WIDTH
                    if it is longer than WIDTH.
               # == cuts the field contents after position WIDTH
                    if it is longer than WIDTH.
* The `--cc-holidays=CC[+CC+...]' option now allows to select more country
    specific holidays (partially incomplete), which are:
