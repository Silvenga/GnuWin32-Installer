TODO file for Gcal.

Planned features:

   * Create XML output (high priority).

   * Create more wrapper scripts which produce diverse sheets using
     Postscript/[La]TeX if output using XML is still unimplemented, for
     adding to a personal _agenda_ (high priority).  I'm waiting for
     your solutions!

   * Display more phase data and times of lunar and solar eclipses
     (high priority).  I'm waiting for your solutions!

   * Add Hinduistic and Buddhistic calendar scheme and holidays (high
     priority).  I'm waiting for your solutions!

   * Support more country specific date formats which are burned-in
     into the program itself and are selectable during program start-up
     (medium priority).  I would like to hear your suggestions!

   * Support more Gregorian Reformation periods which are burned-in
     into the program itself and are selectable during program start-up
     (medium priority).  I would like to hear your suggestions!

   * Support systems with Terminfo and without Termcap (low priority).

Nothing else to do actually, do *you* see anything missing?

Please send comments to my postal or electronic mail address.

By the way...

     I'm looking for volunteers who create a graphical front end to the
     `gcal' back end.  If you are interested in working out such a
     front end or you have already created one (native X11 and/or
     Tcl/Tk, Motif, DOZE-Win [NT], WIN 95 or 98 or 2000, OS/2 PM,
     Apple...), please contact me!

     Some extended ideas could be part of such a user surface, like
     formatting of output for different printers or output converted to
     Postscript/[La]TeX, better time management of fixed dates...
