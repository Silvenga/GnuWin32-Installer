HISTORY file for `gcal'.


Incomplete history (dates and events from my brain):


v3.01   20000630 Some minor changes in the `doc/LL/texi/gcal.texi'
                   documentation (fixed some typos and extended the
                   manuals with description text for the new options).
                 Now, text variable references like `$[FORMAT]TVAR TEXT' at
                   the beginning of a Gcal resource file are expanded correctly
                   if the contents of the TVAR that is used with the FORMAT
                   instruction results in a *valid* Gcal date-part, that may
                   be used in a resource file line.
                 Now, the `--execute-command' option also works correctly
                   for global text variable assignments like `-r$a?echo $HOME'
                   or `-r$b=expr 2 + 2 2>&1' if it is written *before* such a
                   text variable option in the command line (Sorry, it still
                   does not work if it is given *behind* such a text variable
                   option in the command line).
                 Changed behavior of Gcal in terms how it choses the default
                   style of year calendar sheets if the `--type' option is used.
                 Fixed some typos in `./doc/mksamp.in'.
                 Now, the `--grouping-text[=TEXT]' option also recognizes
                   a '^'-CARET character for line break-up, global $TVAR
                   references and `%?'... special texts that are used for
                   text replacement.
                 New `--heading-text=TEXT' option that can be used
                   to create a self-defined title text for the fixed
                   date list.  The TEXT argument may contain '~'-TILDE
                   and '^'-CARET characters for line break-up, global $TVAR
                   references and `%?'... special texts that are used for
                   text replacement.
                 Fixed a typo in `./data/scripts/v2x2v300.pl'.
                 Changed layout of Copyright texts to improve the
                   legal clearness.
                 Increased the version number to 3.01.

v3.00   20000607 Some major changes in the `doc/LL/texi/gcal.texi'
                   documentation.
                 Changed my old and momentary (20000527) recent
                   <esken@uni-muenster.de> eMail address to <esken@gmx.net>,
                   because I do not know for how long my old address will
                   remain valid.  At any case, the <esken@gmx.net> eMail
                   account will hopefully be available for a long time.
                 Changed <bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org> eMail address
                   to <bug-gcal@gnu.org>.
                 The new `--cycle-end=ARG' and `--cycle-step=ARG' options can
                   be used for flexibly displaying a table of astronomical
                   %sun* and %moon* special text times and data within a given
                   time interval that is valid for a single day.  If the
                   `--cycle-end=ARG' option is given, the argument of the
                   `--time-offset' option serves as the CYCLE-START value!
                 Changed behavior of ``empty'' text variables TVAR,
                   which are not displayed AS-IS anymore if referenced.
                 New `--adjust-value=ARG' option for setting a user-defined
                   rise/set-based reference altitude which is respected by
                   the %sun* and %*moon special texts, respectively, the shadow
                   length factor that is respected by the %sun* special texts.
                 New `--atmosphere=ARG' option for setting the air pressure
                   and temperature, which are the main values to calculate
                   the actual amount of atmospheric refraction that is
                   respected by some times and data of the %sun* and %moon*
                   special texts.  If the air pressure argument is set to a
                   value less equal zero, the %sun* and %moon* special texts
                   do not correct some times and data by the amount of
                   atmospheric refraction.
                 The new `misc/mrms/*' files can be used to display the times
                   at which moonset/moonrise has happened in the past resp.,
                   will happen in the future, based on the actual local time
                   for several geographic locations around the world.
                 Outsourced the astronomical functions into the new files
                   `src/hd-astro.c', `src/hd-astro.h', `src/rc-astro.c' and
                   `src/rc-astro.h'.
                 Added new `data/bkk.rc', `data/ms.rc', `data/de-mdata.rc',
                   `data/de-sdata.rc', `data/mdata.rc', `data/sdata.rc'
                   and `data/sun-moon.rc' demonstration resource files.
                 Increased the version number to 3.00.

v2.50   20000303 Increased the year of copyright to 2000.
                 Updated `doc/texinfo.tex' file (version 1999-10-01.07).
                 Updated `doc/calendar.faq' file (Version 2.1 - 10 Oct 1999).
                 Added four new `%?[ARG]' "special texts with other argument"
                   for displaying moonrise, moonset, Moon's day length and
                   Moon's night length approximately (%(, %), %[ and %]).
                 Changed behavior of the `--starting-day' and `--type'
                   options, which do not implicitly enable a month calendar
                   sheet anymore.
                 If the date given as an argument to the `--gregorian-reform'
                   option is beyond the actual (Gregorian) system date, the
                   actual (Gregorian) system date and a date which is given
                   by the actual date modifier %DATE will be automatically
                   converted to the proper proleptic Julian calendar date now.
                 The maximum year number which may be given as an argument to
                   the `--gregorian-reform' option is 10002 now.  So it is
                   possible to calculate proleptic Julian calendars likewise
                   Chinese/Japanese calendar holidays/months until 31-Dec-9999.
                 Changed behavior when analyzing the NLS $LANGUAGE, $LC_* and
                   $LANG i18n environment variables.  Any of these environment
                   variables which are defined, but have an empty value, are
                   unrespected now.
                 Removed a bug that occurred when display time values, and
                   that time values like `11:60' are now correctly displayed
                   as `12:00'.
                 New `--precise' option for displaying the precise,
                   non-rounded, data and times of the %sun*, %moon* and
                   %distance special text.
                 New `--limit' option for displaying only the sunrise and
                   sunset times of the %sun* special text which appear on
                   the actual day.
                 Improved astronomical functions (Sun/Moon times and data).
                 Added 273 new countries/territories, which can be accessed
                   by using the `--cc-holidays=CC[+CC+...]' option.
                 New `--time-offset=ARG' option for setting a time offset value
                   added, which is respected by
                   `--astronomical-holidays' (Moon phase, solar and lunar
                   eclipse, equinox, solstice),
                   `--zodiacal-marker-holidays',
                   `--celtic-holidays',
                   `--chinese-flexible-holidays',
                   `--chinese-flexible-months',
                   `--japanese-flexible-holidays',
                   `--japanese-flexible-months' and
                   `--multicultural-new-year-holidays'.  So it is possible
                   to calculate such astronomically based events based on
                   localtime instead of UT/GMT only.  Works also for the
                   %sun* and %moon* special texts.
                 New `--bahai-months' option for including the Bahai
                   calendar months into the eternal holiday list added.
                 New `--chinese-flexible-months' option for including the
                   Chinese calendar months based on the meridian given as a
                   time factor by the `--time-offset' option into the eternal
                   holiday list added.
                 New `--chinese-months' option for including the Chinese
                   calendar months into the eternal holiday list added.

                   French Revolutionary calendar months into the eternal
                   holiday list added.
                 New `--hebrew-months' option for including the Hebrew

                 New `--indian-civil-months' option for including the Indian
                   civil calendar months into the eternal holiday list added.
                 New `--islamic-civil-months' option for including the Islamic
                   civil calendar months into the eternal holiday list added.
                 New `--japanese-flexible-months' option for including the
                   Japanese calendar months based on the meridian given as a
                   time factor by the `--time-offset' option into the eternal
                   holiday list added.
                 New `--japanese-months' option for including the Japanese
                   calendar months into the eternal holiday list added.
                 New `--old-armenic-months' option for including the
                   Old-Armenic calendar months into the eternal holiday
                   list added.
                 New `--old-egyptic-months' option for including the
                   Old-Egyptic calendar months into the eternal holiday
                   list added.
                 New `--persian-jalaali-months' option for including the
                   Persian ``Jalaali'' calendar months into the eternal

                   a time factor by the `--time-offset' option into the
                   eternal holiday list added.
                 New `--chinese-holidays' option for including some Chinese

                 New `--multicultural-new-year-holidays' option for including
                   some multicultural New Year's Day holidays into the eternal
                   holiday list added.
                 Now, all dates of Easter-based holidays of the Orthodox
                   Christian Eastern churches are implicitly converted to
                   the appropriate Gregorian date according to the Gregorian
                   Reformation period as respected in Greece.
                 New `--orthodox-old-holidays' option for including some
                   Orthodox Christian Eastern churches old calendar
                   holidays into the eternal holiday list added.
                 New `--orthodox-new-holidays' option for including some

                   holiday list added.
                 New `--zodiacal-marker-holidays' option for including some
                   Zodiacal marker data (aka the Chinese/Japanese major/minor
                   solar terms resp., aka the Chinese ZhongQi's/JieQi's)
                   into the eternal holiday list added.
                 Removed the `--without-standard-holidays' option.
                 Removed a bug that occurred during century leap years when
                   displaying holidays of Orthodox Churches.
                 When using an external pager via $PAGER environment variable,
                   possible command line arguments stored there are passed now.
                 Changed option `--mail=ADDRESS' to `--mail[=ADDRESS]'.
                   If no ADDRESS is specified, use contents of $MAILTO as
                   ADDRESS.  If $MAILTO is not set, use contents of $USER as
                   ADDRESS.  If $USER is not set, use contents of $LOGNAME as
                   ADDRESS.  If $LOGNAME is not set, do not send eMail.
                 New text variable assignment `TVAR?COMMAND' implemented,
                   which assigns that text to TVAR --interpreted by Gcal--,
                   which is created by the COMMAND on the STDOUT channel.
                   This kind of assigment is performed only in case the
                   `--execute-command' option is given.
                 New text variable assignment `TVAR:COMMAND' implemented,
                   which assigns that text to TVAR --uninterpreted by Gcal--,
                   which is created by the COMMAND on the STDOUT channel.
                   This kind of assigment is performed only in case the
                   `--execute-command' option is given.
                 Removed the highlighting from the help screens and changed
                   the layout of the basic help screen (`--help' option).
                 Removed fixed date modifier [B] (== `--bypass-shell-command')
                   completely but added `--execute-command' instead, which is
                   set to FALSE by default for safer program execution.
                 Changed the file searching mechanism for resource, response,
                   and user included files, and that searching by using the
                   GCALPATH environment variable is done prior before searching
                   by using the HOME environment variable.
                 Added `doc/mksamp.in' and the SED scripts `mks1sed.in'
                   (expanded to `mksamp-1.sed'), and `mks2sed.in' (expanded to
                   `mksamp-2.sed') for generating Texinfo files from the
                   `doc/LL/examples/*.in' examples template files ready to
                   include into the `doc/LL/texi/gcal.texi' documentation.
                 Added all example resource files from the Gcal Texinfo
                   reference manual to the `doc/LL/examples/' subdirectories.
                 A '-' character leading one of the `%?' "special texts without
                   any argument" (`%[FORMAT]y', `%[FORMAT]m', `%[FORMAT]w'
                   and `%[FORMAT]d') switches the sign of the computed value.
                 Renamed the Gcal supported environment variable LINES to
                   GCAL_LINES, COLUMNS to GCAL_COLUMNS, LI to LINES and
                   CO to COLUMNS.
                 Changed `doc/Makefile.in' target `info' so it creates 8-bit
                   `doc/LL/gcal.info*' files assuming the next official
                   release of Texinfo's `info' reader supports 8-bit
                   characters.
                 New `Makefile.in' and `doc/Makefile.in' target `html'
                   implemented so that `doc/LL/gcal.html' files are now
                   part of the distribution.
                 Removed `doc/Makefile.in' target `txt' so that no 8-bit plain
                   text `doc/LL/gcal.txt' files are part of the distribution
                   anymore.
                 Added new `doc/LL/txi-LL.tex' files.
                 The new `misc/wloc/*' files can be used to create
                   location files which contain the air line distances and
                   the direction/course angles between several geographic
                   locations around the world.
                 The new `misc/ddiff/*' files can be used to create Gcal
                   location resource files which contain the day/night lengths

                 Russian translation by Oleg S. Tihonov.
                 Created AWK/Perl `data/scripts/v2x2v300' scripts for
                   converting all `%?'... special texts of former Gcal versions
                   into their "new" style.
                 The new `misc/srss/*' files can be used to display the times
                   at which sunset/sunrise has happened in the past resp.,
                   will happen in the future, based on the actual local time
                   for several geographic locations around the world.
                 Removed the obsolete `misc/wdays.*' files, see `misc/README'
                   for further information.
                 By reason of implementing the optional format instruction which
                   can be used by many format elements in the date format text
                   now, the burned-in default country specific date formats for
                   `DE == Germany', `US == U.S.A.' and `GB == Great Britain',
                   which can be specified by the `--date-format' option are

                 By reason of implementing the optional format instruction which
                   can be used by many date format texts now, some format
                   elements which can be individually specified by the

                   for copying files.
                 Version 1.6 of `misc/gcalltx/gcalltx.pl' added, which
                   superseeds previous versions.
                 Fixed a bug that occurred in case the `--starting-day'
                   longoption was used with the argument `0'.
                 Fixed a bug that caused a core dump in case the argument ARG
                   given to the `--date-format' longoption contained a trailing
                   single backslash character.
                 Fixed a bug that caused a wrong error message in case either
                   the `--gregorian-reform' or the `--date-format'
                   longoption argument was an 'a' or 'A' character only.
                 Increased the version number to 2.50.

v2.41   19980712 Version 1.5 of `misc/gcalltx/gcalltx.*' added.
                 Added new `%?[ARG]' "special text with other argument"
                   for displaying the actual Greenwich Mean Time (%@).
                 Improved math emulation code (still slow).
                 Option `--resource-file=-[+...]' resp., `-f|F-[+...]' reads
                   from stdin channel now; `-f|F -[+...]' still searches for
                   a file by the name of `-'.
                 Changed the definition for a %time "special text with other
                   argument", which template was `%t[12|24]' and is now
                   defined as `%t[*][[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]'.
                 Updated to GNU `gettext' version 0.10.35.
                 New `doc/ISO_6709' file.
                 Updated `doc/ISO_3166' file (1997/01/07).
                 Added four new `%?[ARG]' "special texts with other argument"
                   for displaying sunrise, sunset, day length and night length
                   approximately (%o, %s, %u and %z).
                 Improved the processing speed of the `tcal' program in case
                   it has to deal with ``large'' displacement values.
                 Changed the upper-case metatexts indicating the year (yyyy),
                   month (mm) etc. to lower-case texts in Gcal's help screens.
                 The new `misc/dst/*' files convert ZONEINFO Daylight
                   Saving Time informations into Gcal's fixed date format.
                 The `tcal' program uses `execvp()' instead of `system()' now
                   for running the Gcal executable.
                 Fixed date modifier [a] (== `--include-resource-file-name')
                   also puts the line number of the fixed date into output.
                 Updated `doc/texinfo.tex' file (v2.227 - 1998/02/25).
                 Changed <bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu> eMail address
                   to <bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org>.
                 Added more information text about Gcal's current i18n
                   default mode in the version text.
                 New `--iso-week-number=yes|no' option for determing
                   the type of week numbers used in the calendar sheet
                   and the fixed date list.
                 Implemented some basic operations on text variables
                   which are allowed in case TVAR contains an integer value:
                     TVAR++
                     TVAR--
                     TVAR+=[+|-]N
                     TVAR-=[+|-]N
                 Extended the basic date variable operation `DVAR+=N'
                   to `DVAR+=[+|-]N'.
                 Extended the basic date variable operation `DVAR-=N'
                   to `DVAR-=[+|-]N'.
                 Extended definition of real Julian day number special text
                   from `%j[[-]N]' to `%j[[+|-]N]'.
                 Renamed the `--exit-status-help-127' option to
                   `--exit-status-help-non-zero'.
                 New `--ignore-case' option for ignoring case distinctions
                   in both the PATTERN and the text part of a resource file
                   line, if the `--filter-text=PATTERN' option is specified.
                 New `--revert-match' option for reverting the sense of
                   matching, i.e. to select non-matching lines, in case
                   the `--filter-text=PATTERN' option is specified.
                 If the text part of a resource file line contains managed
                   highlighting sequences (%1, %2... special texts) and the
                   `--filter-text=PATTERN' option is given, the inserted
                   ``real'' highlighting sequences remain unrespected now
                   by the regular expression search.
                 The temporary file which is created if the `--here=LINE'
                   option is specified, is always taken from the actual
                   directory in case no absolute file name is created for it,
                   instead of searching it like it were an ordinary resource
                   file.
                 Fixed a bug that caused a neverending loop in the "number of
                   productions" optimization step in the `rc_check()' function
                   of `rc-check.c' in case an "appears" field was given in the
                   date part of a resource file line.
                 Removed a bug (changed format width from 2 to 3 digits)
                   which occurred in the two `%?[DATE]' "special texts with
                   date argument" used for displaying a day number with
                   leading zeroes (`%*' and `%#').
                 The new `misc/moon/*' files show how advanced use
                   of Gcal can be done in shell script files.
                 The new `misc/daily/*' files demonstrate how basic
                   time management of fixed dates can be done.
                 Added new `%?TEXT' "special texts with text argument"
                   for displaying the contents of environment variables (%-).
                 Corrected and added some Thai holidays (CC=th).
                 New `misc/gcalmagic.add' for adding to `/etc/magic' file.
                 Fixed date modifier [Q]
                   (== `--suppress-fixed-dates-list-separator')
                   for suppressing the leading blank line shown before the
                   fixed date list title added.
                 No post-search for files in the burned-in GCAL_???_DATADIR
                   directories is performed anymore in case the GCAL_???_DATADIR
                   environment variable is set, but the file is NOT found there.
                 A few bugfixes in some `Makefile.in' files.
                 Fixed a memory allocation bug in the `file_read_line()'
                   function of `src/file-io.c' which occurred while expanding
                   local text variables recursively.
                 The private `./install-inf.in' script doesn't create
                   a basic `dir' file anymore in case no `dir.texi' file
                   is found in the users `@infodir@' and a `dir' file is
                   already existing there.
                 Some minor changes in the `doc/LL/texi/gcal.texi'
                   documentation.
                 Increased the version number to 2.41.

                   Claus Tondering <c-t@pip.dknet.dk>, thanks Claus.
                 Internationalized the `ARG' text which is used in help pages.
                 Added six new `%?' "special texts without any argument" for
                   conditionally highlighting of text (%5 , %6 ... %9 and %0).
                 Fixed date modifier [U] (== `--suppress-date-part') added.
                 Removed the `-m ADDRESS' short-style option for sending eMails.
                 Fixed a memory allocation bug that occurred while resizing
                   the internal string buffers in some cases.
                 The `--biorhythm-axis=NUMBER' option can be used now for
                   setting the width of a `%;[DATE]' biorhythm text graphics
                   (NUMBER within the range of 1...100, the default width of
                   a single axis is 20 characters).
                 Added two new `%?[DATE]' "special texts with date argument"
                   for displaying the biorhythm cycle (%, and %;).
                 The `--moonimage-lines=NUMBER' option can be used now for
                   setting the number of lines of a `%:[DATE]' Moon phase text
                   graphics (NUMBER within the range of 6...30, the default
                   height of the image are 12 lines).
                 Updated to GNU `gettext' version 0.10.27.
                 Swedish translation by Johan Linde.
                 Improved signal handling.
                 The `--here=LINE' option (== `-# LINE') can be used now for
                   defining resource file lines, which are additionally
                   processed at last in each resource file processing cycle.
                 Added three new `%?[DATE]' "special texts with date argument"
                   for displaying the Moon phase approximately (%- , %_ and %:).
                 Increased the version number to 2.40, because version 2.30
                   was an inofficial beta testing release.

v2.30   19970102 Changed layout of the texts which are emitted by the `--help',
                   `license' and `--version' option.
                 The `--orthodox-calendar' option (== `-O') can be used now
                   for calculating the leap years as done by the Eastern
                   orthodox churches.
                 Corrected the fixed date feature for that year in which
                   the Gregorian Reformation have occurred.
                 The burned-in Gregorian Reformation period 18-28 Feb 1753
                   (`--gregorian-reform=1753') is new.
                 The burned-in Gregorian Reformation period 19-28 Feb 1700

v2.20   19961204 Dutch translation by Erick Branderhorst.
                 French translation by Michel Robitaille.
                 The MAILPROG environment variable can be used now for
                   specifying the program which is used as the mailer.
                 The new `--cc-holidays=CC[+CC+...]' option now allows
                   to select the country specific holidays which are part
                   of the eternal holiday list.  Already supported country
                   specific holidays are:

                 Removed the `--de-holidays' and `--us-holidays' options.
                 The `--without-standard-holidays' option disables all
                   "standard" holidays.
                 `doc/*/texi/gcal.texi' files conforming to GNU `Texinfo 3.8'.
                 Fixed date modifier [Z] (== `--zero-dates-only') added.
                 The `--filter-period=ARG' option (== `-P ARG') can be used now
                   for displaying only those fixed dates which are matched by
                   the ARG.  ARG is one or more of the `%?[DATE]' "special
                   texts with date argument" (without a leading '%' character
                   and connected by a `,' character) used for date exclusion,
                   means "inclusive/exclusive date period".
                 The `--filter-day=ARG' option (== `-D ARG') can be used now
                   for displaying only those fixed dates which are matched by
                   the ARG.  ARG is one or more of the `%?' "special texts
                   without argument" (without a leading '%' character) used
                   for date exclusion, means "inclusive/exclusive day period".
                 Fixed date modifier [B] (== `--bypass-shell-command') added.
                 Created the `gcal2txt' documentation.
                 The `gcal2txt.c' file, which creates a verbatim text file
                   from a Gcal resource file is part of distribution now.
                 Error message #104 (invalid REGEX search pattern) is new.
                 The `--filter-text=PATTERN' option (== `-I PATTERN')) can be
                   used now for displaying only those fixed dates which are
                   matched by the regular expression search pattern.
                 A `^' character given in the "text"-part of a resource file
                   line creates a real `\n' newline character (similar `~'
                   character), except the fact that text breaked up by it
                   isn't provided implicitly with leading blanks.
                 Most files in `systems/os2' are rewritten by
                   Kai Uwe Rommel <rommel@ars.de>.
                 Created AWK/Perl scripts for converting all `%?'... special
                   texts of former Gcal versions into their "new" style.
                 A bunch of new special texts (the `%?'... things) implemented,
                   which can be used in the text part of a resource file line.
                 Outsourced the C function `insert_line_into_table()' of file
                   `rc-check.c' into the new file `rc-insert.c' and respected
                   this in all Makefile targets touched by this.
                 Increased the version number to 2.20, because version 2.11
                   was an inofficial beta testing release.

v2.11   19960823 Option `-K' respectively `--with-week-number' now
                   provides the calendar sheets with ISO week numbers.
                 The date variable `t' (yyyy@e|t|dvar[+|-]N[`www']) references
                   the actual date now and has a special meaning therefore
                   (likewise `e').
                 Supports `libncurses.a' now.
                 Improved my private `install-info' shell script a bit.
                 Removed the '\015' characters at the end of each line in
                   the file `src/rc-check.c' (former `src/gcal-rcc.c').
                 Renamed most files in the `src/' directory.
                 A few changes in the Texinfo documentation.
                 Portability fixes and tiny optimizations in some of
                   the `gcal' sources.

v2.10   19960716 Rewrote the `tcal-sh' shell script as a C program.
                 Several long-style options implemented like --today,
                   --tomorrow, --week, --end-of-week, start-of-week,
                   --month, --end-of-month, --start-of-month, --year,
                   --end-of-year and --start-of-year, which are ALIAS
                   names of the according modifiers of the -c|C[]
                   short-style option.
                 The German `.info' and `.txt' files likewise the German
                   message catalog `de.po' are conforming the ISO-8859-1
                   character set now.
                 My private `install-info' shell script now respects that
                   `infodir', which is explicitly set during the configuration
                   step by the installer.
                 Re-formatted the BUGS, INSTALL, LIMITATIONS, README, SYMBOLS,
                   THANKS, TODO, data/README and systems/README files.
                 The new %z and %Z directive of --date-format=PRESET_VALUE|ARG
                   option now allows to display the last two digits of a year.
                 Updated to GNU `gettext' version 0.10.23.

v2.01   19960617 The --version option informs about the compiler/OS used and
                   the date of compilation now.  See `THANKS' for more details.
                 Added %k[yyyy[mm[dd|`www'[<n>]]]] macro, which is replaced by
                   the ISO-week number of the current/specified date in the
                   text part of a resource file line.
                 Added %o[yyyy[mm[dd|`www'[<n>]]]] macro, which is replaced by
                   the complete textual weekday name of the current/specified
                   date in the text part of a resource file line.
                 Fixed a bug in writing response/shell script files, which
                   occurred if a "MM YYYY-YYYY" command must be written.
                 Removed the lib/ directory and all references to it, because
                   GNU `gettext' doesn't need it any longer for creating a
                   libintl.a library, which is local to the package.
                 Updated to GNU `gettext' version 0.10.14.
                 A "text-part" of a resource file line may be provided now
                   with leading whitespace characters if the first of these
                   leading whitespace characters is quoted.
                 Replaced all #elif C Preprocessor directives by
                   #else...#if... cascades.
                 More representations of the German `Umlaute' characters
                   for several machines/character sets received by
                   Bruno Haible <haible@ilog.fr>... thx Bruno:)
                 C Preprocessor symbol USE_EASC reimplemented, which can
                   be enabled during configuration step.
                 Fixed a bug that causes an infinite program loop in case
                   a range of days was given in a resource file and a
                   displacement factor of a range component was outside
                   the year bounds like `1996@e#-40sun'.
                 Fixed a bug which occurred if the table of command line
                   arguments (`my_argv[]') was resized during processing
                   of response files.
                 `const char *usage_msg()' prototype changed to
                   `char *usage_msg()'.
                 Performed a few changes in the Texinfo documentation
                   (corrected xref's).

v2.00   19960516 Created shell script file (-S ARG) now embraces all arguments
                   passed to `gcal'  with  '  characters instead of  "
                   characters.
                 Renamed --export-local-date-variables long-style option to
                   --export-date-variables.
                 The new --export-text-variables option now allows to
                   export local text variables from file to file.
                 The new --text-variable=ARG option (resp., -r ARG) now allows
                   the definition of global text variables.
                 Error message #105 (invalid text variable definition) is new.
                 Implemented the use of global and local text variables
                   (`tvar'->$a...$z), which can be set to ordinary text, %...
                   macros and references to other text variables and are
                   expanded resp., respected everywhere in a resource file
                   line if referenced there.
                 Removed the --assign=ARG long-style option.
                 Eliminated a bug in `gcal_rcc.c', which occurred if
                   string resizing was performed and more than one whitespace
                   character was used for separating the "date-part" and the
                   "text-part" of a line.
                 New command implemented:  mm/jjjj-jjjj  or  mm jjjj-jjjj
                   which displays a range of a selected month
                   of specified years.
                 Documentation for `txt2gcal' and `tcal' created.
                 Gcal package internationalized by means of the
                   GNU gettext package (German message catalogs).
                 Reorganized package structure.
                 Changed symbol/environment variable GCAL_USR_LIBDIR to
                   GCAL_USR_DATADIR and GCAL_SYS_LIBDIR to GCAL_USR_DATADIR.
                 Changed default file name for GCAL_USR_LIBDIR from
                   "$HOME/lib/gcal-lib" to "$HOME/share/gcal" and for
                   GCAL_SYS_LIBDIR from "/usr/lib/gcal-lib"
                   to "/usr/local/share/gcal".
                 Renamed `gcal_cfg.hin' to standard `config.hin'.
                 Fixed a bug in the `tcal' shell script (months July and
                   August were not managed correctly).
                 Some new date variable assignments/operations implemented:
                   dvar=dvar[+|-]N      --> Assignment of a date variable
                                              `dvar', advanced by plus/minus
                                              N days.
                   dvar=dvar[+|-]N`www' --> Assignment of a date variable
                                              `dvar', advanced by plus/minus
                                              N weekdays `www'.
                   dvar+=N`www'         --> Addition of N weekdays `www'.
                   dvar-=N`www'         --> Subtraction of N weekdays `www'.
                 An underscore ('_') character which is used in option
                   arguments is converted to a real blank/space (' ')
                   character now unless it's quoted like '\_'.
                 The (pre)selected/defined "date format" is used now to
                   set the attributes in calendar sheets.
                 The new GCAL_DATE_FORMAT environment variable can be used
                   to preset the date format, which is used to order a
                   displayed date.
                 The new --date-format=PRESET_VALUE|ARG option now allows
                   flexible ordering of a displayed date.
                 The contents of the GCALPATH environment variable will
                   be used now on all systems for searching resource and
                   response files.
                 A highlighting management bug fixed which occurred if the
                   -j option and the -jc[b] options are both given and
                   highlighting must performed for holidays.
                 New GNU long-style option mode implemented, which either
                   allows the selection of a SPECIAL option argument or of
                   a GIVEN option argument (see --gregorian-reform=YEAR|ARG,
                   where ARG is a user defined Gregrorian Reformation date
                   yyyy,mm,dd,dd).
                 The `txt2gcal.c' file, which creates a verbatim Gcal resource
                   file from a text file is part of distribution now.
                 The contents of the TZ (timezone) environment variable is
                   displayed now in the header part of created response files,
                   shell script files and outgoing Emails.
                 Serious bug in management of Termcap padding eliminated.
                 Small bug eliminated, which occurred if %... text macros
                   were quoted.
                 The central `print_text()' function works a bit faster now.
                 Changed the file searching mechanism with the effect, that
                   files are no longer searched in the actual directory
                   (sure, this can be forced by e.g.:  `-f foo+./bar+./baz').
                 Revised "eternal holiday" list.
                 Implemented the new run-time option --de-holidays,
                   which provides the eternal holiday list with additional
                   German holidays.
                 The C Preprocessor symbols USE_CATH, USE_USHDY, EXIT_STAT_HLP,
                   GREG_1582 and GREG_1752, which were selectable during the
                   (Auto)configuration step, are made to run-time options of
                   Gcal now (--christian-holidays, --us-holidays,
                   --exit-status-help-127, --gregorian-reform=YEAR).
                 The C Preprocessor symbol DEBUG, which was selectable
                   during the (Auto)configuration step, is eliminated
                   and thus default now.

v1.01   19960320 My private `install-info' shell script is part of the
                   distribution now.
                 Rejected my specific copyright conditions, because these
                   contradict the terms of the GPL.
                 Some small bugfixes
                   (the header file <sys/types.h> wasn't included properly)
                   (several NON-ANSI function prototypes were buggy)
                   (the German time separating character `.' wasn't respected).

v1.00   19960309 Table sizes of all STRINGS are managed dynamically now.
                 Specific copyright conditions are part of Gcal now,
                   see the file COPYING2 for more information.
                 The option `--starting-day=0' can now be specified as
                   `--starting-day=today' respectively `-s today', too.
                 The German program version now accepts the English day and
                   month names if no appropriate German names are given.
                 Added %1, %2, %3 and %4 macros for user defined
                   text highlighting in the text part of a resource file.
                 Unlimited nesting level of include files realized.
                 Implemented the use of an optional "repetition" factor and an
                   optional "appearance" factor, which can be added to the end
                   of a date part of fixed dates, which are given in a resource
                   file (`:' leads a repetition factor, `.' leads an appearance
                   factor):
                     yyyymmdd:N
                     yyyymmdd:N.N
                     yyyymmdd:N,[mm]dd:N.N ...
                     yyyymmdd#[mm]dd.N
                     yyyymmdd#[mm]`www'N.N
                     yyyymm`www'N:N
                     yyyymm`www'N:N.N
                     yyyymm`www'N:N,[mm]`www'N:N.N ...
                     yyyymm`www'N#[mm]`www'N.N
                     yyyymm`www'N#[mm]dd.N
                     yyyymm`www'#`www'.N
                   [ All the above codings are allowed with the
                     yyyy@e|dvar[+|-]N[`www'] and the yyyy*d|wN[`www']
                     date formats, too! ]
                 Implemented optional lists and ranges of days, which can be
                   added to the date part of fixed dates, which are given in
                   a resource file (`,' is the list separator character,
                   `#' the range separator character):
                     yyyymmdd|`www'|`www'N,[mm]dd|[mm]`www'|[mm]`www'N ...
                     yyyymm`www'#`www'

                     yyyy*d|wN`www'#N`www'
                     yyyy@e|dvar,|[+|-]N[`www'],[+|-]N[`www'],[+|-]N[`www'],[+|-]N[`www'] ...
                     yyyy@e|dvar[+|-]N[`www']#[+|-]N[`www']
                 Gcal now checks for the existence of an external `pg' pager.
                 Put all help screens, the software license and
                   the version information into the new `gcal_hlp.c' file.
                 Renamed `gcal_cfg.h.in' to `gcal_cfg.hin'.
                 The subject for an outgoing Email is now created
                   via the `-s' option of the `mail' program.
                 Added %j[[-]N] macro (real Julian day number).
                 Changed the `week number of year' text.
                 A fixed date warning which results to a leap day (i.e. the
                   29'th February), is displayed at the 28'th February in
                   non-leap years if the option `--leap-day=february' is given
                   resp., at the 1'st March if the option `--leap-day=march'
                   is given.
                 Elimated a bug in `eval_longopt()' function which
                   occurred if option `--usage=version' was given.
                 Splitted the `rc_check()' and the `rc_use()' functions.
                 The `--long-help=?' resp., `--usage=?' option now
                   prints a list of all valid long-style options.
                 Renamed `--hidden' option to `--export-local-date-variables'.
                 Alternative format of fixed date list (--alternative-format
                   resp., fixed date modifier [A]) implemented.
                 Table size of `month_list[]' is managed dynamically now.
                 Increased the version number to 1.00.

v0.39   19951220 Fixed some bugs in the C sources.
                 A positive displacement value for a date variable may
                   either be given `@dvar+N' or `@dvarN' now.

v0.38   19951213 Changed introduction text in `gcal-*.info*' files.
                 `configure' script creates definition file `gcal_cfg.h' now.
                 Corrected the buggy `Makefile' target "check".
                 Added environment variable GCALANSI, which must be defined
                   (not necessarily set) if ANSI escape highlighting sequences
                   should be substituted respectively emitted by default.
                 Redefined the "starting_day_of_week_option", which requires
                   an argument now (--starting-day=ARG respectively -s ARG,
                   and new ARG is 0 | 1|Mon|2|Tue|...|7|Sun).
                 Short-style options which require an argument can be given
                   now either in the `-Xfoo' or in the `-X foo' notation.
                 --exclude-holiday-list-title resp., -X option excludes
                   the title text of an eternal holiday list now.
                 Independant use of standard dates, Julian dates and both
                   standard- and Julian dates in calendar sheet (-j -jb),
                   eternal holiday list (-jn -jnb) and fixed date warning
                   list (-jc -jcb).
                 Now all internal tables are checked if they are presorted
                   to decide whether the `qsort()' function must be called.
                 Improved the speed of the file reading function.
                 Complete revision of -c|C[] modifier parsing.
                 -c|C<n> option eliminated.
                 -c|C[0]... for indicating a list eliminated, used
                   further modifier [l] --list-mode instead.
                 -c|Cmmwww<n>n is now -c|Cmmwww<n> without mode character 'n'.
                 Further fixed date modifiers added ([0] indicates
                   that a list instead of a single date is generated):
                   [0]*d1...365|366|999   (== *d<n>)
                     means absolute day <n> of year.
                   [0]*d1...52|53|99www   (== *d<n>www)
                     means <n>'th weekday www of year.
                   [0]*w0|1...52|53|99    (== *w<n>)
                     means Monday of <n>'th week of year.
                   [0]*w0|1...52|53|99www (== *w<n>www)
                     means weekday `www' of <n>'th week of year.
                 Date variables are able to manage the new date format now
                   (e.g. dvar=*d<n>[www]).
                 The %s..., %e..., %b... and %y... macros are able to
                   manage the new date format now (e.g. %syyyy*d<n>[www]).
                 Actual date modifier manages the new date formats now
                   (%yyyy*d<n>[ww] resp., %yyyy*w<n>[www]).
                 Included new date formats yyyy*d<n>[ww] and yyyy*w<n>[www]
                   for encoding fixed dates in a resource file.
                 Changed description text of `wn' to `www' (means short
