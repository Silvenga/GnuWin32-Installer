What is it?
-----------
Gcal: print calendars

Description
-----------
Gcal is a program for calculating and printing calendars. Gcal
displays hybrid and proleptic Julian and Gregorian calendar sheets,
respectively for one month, three months, or a whole year. It also
displays eternal holiday lists for many countries around the globe,
and features a very powerful creation of fixed date liststhat can
be used for reminding purposes. Gcal can calculate various astronomical
data and times of the Sun and the Moon for pleasure at any location,
precisely enough for most civil purposes. Gcal supports some other
calendar systems, for example, the Chinese and Japanese calendars,
the Hebrew calendar, and the civil Islamic calendar, too.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in gcal-3.01-GnuWin32.diffs in gcal-3.01-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
