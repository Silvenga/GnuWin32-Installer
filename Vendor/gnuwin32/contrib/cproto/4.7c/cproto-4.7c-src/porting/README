The files in this directory are needed to build on non-UNIX platforms.

getopt.c	This is a free implementation of the getopt function for
getopt.h	systems that don't already have it (such as MS-DOS and VMS).
		Some systems that support auto-configuration may need these
		files.  You'll have to edit the makefile in that case.
 
popen.c		fakes a pipe open/close by writing to a temporary file.
