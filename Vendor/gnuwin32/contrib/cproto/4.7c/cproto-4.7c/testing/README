CPROTO/TESTING

There's several types of files in this directory, distinguished by their
suffixes.

	makefile
		a UNIX makefile used to coordinate files and to invoke the
		UNIX master test script 'run_test.sh'.

	case*.bat
		MSDOS scripts automatically generated to run test cases.

	test_dos.bat
		The master MSDOS test script.

	syntax.c
		The test data (contains some intentional errors, and all of
		the interesting tests that can be made portable across all
		platforms).

	apollo.c
	linux.c
	solaris.c
	turboc.c
		These are lint library templates, used for exercising cproto.
		They include as many of the system's include files as possible,
		in an attempt to find lexical/grammar problems with cproto.

	run_test.com
		The VMS master test script.

	case*.dcl
		UNIX+VMS scripts automatically generated to run test cases.
		(They don't have a ".com" suffix because that would create
		problems on MSDOS).

	descrip.mms
		The VMS equivalent of 'makefile'.

	case*.ref
		Reference files obtained by running the test scripts.

	make_bat.sh
		The script that generates case*.bat

	make_dcl.sh
		The script that generates case*.dcl

	run_test.sh
		The master UNIX test script

	testunix.sh
		The UNIX test script that actually does all of the work

	run_test.txt
		The test list, from which the case*.dcl, case*.bat files
		are generated.
