* JbigKit-1.6 for Windows *
===========================

What is it?
-----------
JbigKit: library and tools for JBIG images

Description
-----------
JBIG-KIT implements a highly effective data compression algorithm
for bi-level high-resolution images such as fax pages or scanned
documents. 

JBIG-KIT provides a portable library of compression and decompression
functions with a documented interface that you can very easily include
into your image or document processing software. In addition, JBIG-KIT
provides ready-to-use compression and decompression programs with a
simple command line interface (similar to the converters found in netpbm).

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in jbigkit-1.6-GnuWin32.diffs in jbigkit-1.6-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
