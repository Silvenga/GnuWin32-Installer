GMakefile is for use with Acorn RISC OS and the forthcoming
post-Acorn RISC OS for the compilation of both the current release and
development versions of zip.

It is recommended that you use gcc 2.95.4 or higher and you will need a 
suitable 'make' utility. Both are available from 
<URL:http://hard-mofo.dsvr.net/gcc/>.

You will need the files gcc.zip and cc1.zip for the C compiler with the
documentation available in the gccdoc.zip archive. GNU make can be 
found in the utils.zip archive, although most versions of 'make' should be
fine.

When using gcc, check RunMe1st for two lines which need uncommenting.
