* Xpm-3.5.1 for Windows *
=========================

What is it?
-----------
Xpm: library for X PixMap images

Description
-----------
XPixMap (XPM) consists of an ASCII image format and a C library. The
format defines how to store color images (X Pixmap) in a portable and
powerful way. The library provides a set of functions to store and
retrieve images to and from XPM format data, being either files, buffers
(files in memory), or data (included files). 

While XPM is not an X Consortium standard, it is already a de facto
standard. It is used in many applications both commercial and
non-commercial. Several vendors distribute the XPM library, as
contributed software, on the platforms they sell. Moreover, the Common
Desktop Environment specifies that icons must be stored either in XBM
or XPM format. Finally, Motif 2.0 from OSF includes the XPM library,
allowing XPM to be used in addition to XBM.

- xpm-3.5.1-1-src.zip

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in xpm-3.5.1-1-GnuWin32.diffs in xpm-3.5.1-1-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
