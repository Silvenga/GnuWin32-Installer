* Sgrep-1.94a for Windows *
===========================

What is it?
-----------
Sgrep: search a file for a structured pattern

Description
-----------
sgrep (structured grep) is a tool for searching and indexing text, SGML,
XML and HTML files and filtering text streams using structural criteria.
The data model of sgrep is based on regions, which are nonempty substrings
of text. Regions are typically occurrences of constant strings, SGML-tags,
or meaningful text elements, which are recognizable through some delimiting
strings or the builtin SGML, XML and HTML parser. Regions can be arbitrarily
long, arbitrarily overlapping, and arbitrarily nested. 

Sgrep is a convenient tool for making queries to almost any kind of text
files with some well kown structure. These include programs, mail folders,
news folders, HTML, SGML, etc... With relatively simple queries you can
display mail messages by their subject or sender, extract titles or links
or any regions from HTML files, function prototypes from C or make complex
queries to SGML files based on the DTD of the file.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in sgrep-1.94a-GnuWin32.diffs in sgrep-1.94a-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
