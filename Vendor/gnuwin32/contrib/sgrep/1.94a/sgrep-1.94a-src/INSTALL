Installing under UNIX-like systems
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do the following steps:

1. Untar the archive.
2. Run "./configure"
3. Run "make"
4. Run "make install"

and you should be all set. The configure script has a few options, which
you may or may not want to modify. Run "configure --help" for a list
of them.

Installing under Win32  (Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The recommended way to install sgrep under Win32-systems is just to
download the Win32-distribution and install the binaries where
you like.

Compiling sgrep under any 32-bit ANSI-C Win32 compiler should be easy,
but you will have to create your Makefiles or project files yourself.

If you have the Cygwin tools, you should be able to compile Sgrep with
just ./configure and make, just like in any real Unix.
