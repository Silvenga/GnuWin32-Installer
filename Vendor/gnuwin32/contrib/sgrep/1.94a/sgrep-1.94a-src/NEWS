Version 1.92a is a bug fix release. Sgrep-1.91a contained a fatal bug
which caused sgrep to core dump every time it was used to search files 
without using the SGML-scanner.

NEWS for vesion 1.91a

Sgrep-1.91a has been made available in source and binary forms.  Binaries are
available for Win32, HP-UX, Linux, OSF1 and Solaris platforms.

Sgrep is a tool to search and index text, SGML, XML and HTML files using
structured patterns. 

New features in version 1.91a include:
- Nearness operators for both ordered and unordered nearness.
- Support for 16-bit wide query terms (this really means, that Sgrep
  now supports Unicode)
- Support for UTF-16 and UTF-8 encodings
- 'parenting' operator is now an order of magnitude faster (in the common 
  case)
- Sgrep now emits and parses #line-directives, which allows for more 
  accurate error reporting
- An option to query terms from index files
- Many bug fixes
- Introduces some new bugs (hopefully not as many as I fixed).

With version 1.91 I have actually implemented all the new features I ever
planned to have in Sgrep-2. There are still things to do, but they are
mostly small enchantments compared to the work required for introducing 
Unicode support to Sgrep. So now I am waiting for your suggestions, while
I am updating the documentation. Should I:

- Add support for using Sgrep from Perl scripts?
- Create examples of how to use Sgrep as a local search engine for 
  WWW-servers?
- Make Sgrep fully XML-comformant? (With Unicode support this is now 
  possible)
- Something else?
- Forget Sgrep, because it isn't really useful?

NEWS for vesion 1.90a

Sgrep-1.90a has been made available in source and binary form. Binaries are
available for Win32, HP-UX, Linux, OSF1 and Solaris platforms.

Sgrep is a tool to search and index text, SGML, XML and HTML files using
structured patterns. This example searches TITLE elements containing word
Hamlet from Jon Bosaks XML-text collections (both the religious texts
and Shakespeares works):

% time sgrep -x index 'stag("TITLE") .. etag("TITLE") 
	containing word("Hamlet")'
<TITLE>The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark</TITLE>

0inputs+0outputs (365major+73minor)pagefaults 0swaps

Sgrep-1.90a is still under development, but can be considered as a
major step towards version 2.0.

New features in 1.90a include
- Query operators supporting direct containment. In SGML and XML world 
  this means that you can query children and parents of given elements.
- The sources are available under GPL-license for those interested in
  compiling sgrep themselves.
- Sgrep now uses GNU autoconf, so compiling sgrep under Unix-systems
  should be easy.
- Many bug fixes
