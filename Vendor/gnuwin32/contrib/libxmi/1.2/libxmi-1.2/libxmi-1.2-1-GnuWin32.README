* LibXmi-1.2 for Windows *
==========================

What is it?
-----------
LibXmi:

Description
-----------
GNU libxmi is a C/C++ function library for rasterizing 2-D vector graphics.
The program can draw 2-D vector graphics primitives, including wide polygonal
line and circular and elliptical arcs, onto a user-supplied matrix of pixels.
Sophisticated line styles, such as multicolored dashing patterns, can be
specified. There is also support for filling and texturing polygons. The
program is based on the vector graphics code found in most X windows system
servers, but despite its origins, libxmi is completely decoupled from X11.
It draws vector graphics onto a user-supplied matrix of pixels, not onto an
on-screen window, and uses its own two-stage graphics pipeline.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in libxmi-1.2-1-GnuWin32.diffs in libxmi-1.2-1-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
