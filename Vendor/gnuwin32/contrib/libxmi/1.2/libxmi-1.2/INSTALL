Please read the file README first; it describes the libxmi library.

To install libxmi as a standalone library, you would do the following.

1. Do `./configure', `make', and `make install', as usual.  This will
   install both libxmi and its header file, xmi.h.

2. Test libxmi by compiling and linking the sample program drawing.c.  You
   would do something like `gcc test.c -lxmi' or `gcc test.c -lxmi -lm' to
   obtain a file `a.out'.  If you invoke a.out, the pixmap described at the
   head of drawing.c should be written to standard output.

(You may also install libxmi as a rendering module in another source tree,
but the details of that are left to you.  See the file ./CUSTOMIZE for
useful hints.)

You may compile libxmi with a C++ compiler rather than a C compiler, by
doing something like `CC=c++ ./configure' instead of just `./configure'.

If you do use a C++ compiler, you should probably add "-DHAVE_BOOL" to
CFLAGS.  This will keep the Boolean datatype from being defined (for any
modern C++ compiler, it is defined automatically).
