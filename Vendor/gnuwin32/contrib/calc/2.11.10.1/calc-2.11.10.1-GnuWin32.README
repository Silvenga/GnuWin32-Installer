* Calc-2.11.10.1 for Windows *
==============================

What is it?
-----------
Calc: arbitrary precision calculator

Description
-----------
Calc is an interactive calculator which provides for easy large
numeric calculations, but which also can be easily programmed for
difficult or long calculations.  It can accept a command line
argument, in which case it executes that single command and exits.
Otherwise, it enters interactive mode.  There are a great number
of pre-defined functions.  The calculator can calculate transcendental
functions, and accept and display numbers in real or exponential format.
The calculator also knows about complex numbers.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in calc-2.11.10.1-GnuWin32.diffs in calc-2.11.10.1-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
