id-utils NEWS - User visible changes.

Version 4.0 - Nov 1, 2005, by Claudio Fontana

* Modernize build system (autotools, gnulib, intl, large file support)
* Cleaned up some code
* Fixed some portability problems (some might remain)
* Integrated perl support

Version 3.2d - April 6, 1999, by Greg McGary

* Modernize lisp/Makefile.am, replace gets with fgets.

* Allocate larger scanner buffer: MIN (2MB, largest file)

* compile lib/regex.c if regcomp is absent in libc.

Version 3.2c - April 3, 1999, by Greg McGary

* Add verbose traces to file walker: `mkid -V'

* New heuristic for computing initial size of token table:
MAX (1M, lg(n) * n * 16)

Version 3.2b - March 29, 1999, by Greg McGary

* Fixed assorted bugs

* Remove arbitrary limit of 32767 on number of files that
  can be scanned.  Now the number of files is only
  limited by available virtual memory.

Version 3.2a - November 22, 1998, by Greg McGary

* Fixed assorted bugs

Version 3.2 - August 6, 1996, by Greg McGary

* Major bug in eid fixed

Version 3.1 - July 17, 1996, by Greg McGary

* A few more portability bugs are fixed

Version 3.0m - July 9, 1996, by Greg McGary

* NLS is now initialized properly

* Assorted portability problems are fixed

* A few bugs (one serious) are fixed

Version 3.0l - skipped `l' (ell) is too easy to confuse with `1' (one)

Version 3.0k - June 5, 1996, by Greg McGary

* `lid's command line has been revised and expanded.  Control over output
  formats is expanded.  Pattern searching options are now complete and
  orthogonal: word/substring, literal/regexp, case (in)sensitivity.

* The texinfo manual, id-utils.texi, is now up-to-date.

* `mkid' and `xtokid' support the new `--prune' option.

* `mkid' and `xtokid' now implement the `--include' and `--exclude 'options.

* `lid -R grep' (a.k.a. `gid') no longer prepends a space to each line--
  now its output is exactly like grep's.

* `fid' separates tokens with spaces if output is to a termianal, and
  otherwise with newlines.

* If lid is in `brace' mode by default, it uses brace notation when
  outputting to a terminal and separates file names with spaces otherwise.
  If printing the token or pattern key is disabled, then file names are
  separated with newlines.

* All programs now accept directory names for the `-f, --file=' args.
  When a directory is given, the file name "ID" is assumed.

* gid.el is renamed id-utils.el and is installed in emacs's site-lisp/

* Source files and directories are reorganized

* Misc. bugs are fixed

Version 3.0j - May 31, 1996, by Greg McGary

* Pre-test versions are now designated with a lower-case letter to shorten
  the top-level directory name to 14 chars.

* `idx' has been renamed `xtokid'.

* The old `pid' program has been reborn as `fnid'.

* Some bugs & build problems are fixed.

* Some missing prototypes are added to header files.

* gcc -Wall (plus a bunch of other other warnings) is happier.

* A number of idtest problems are fixed.

Version 3.0.9 - May 30, 1996, by Greg McGary

* The package name has been changed from `mkid' to `id-utils', and is now
  officially a part of GNU.

* Command-line arguments have been revised to conform with GNU standards.
  Each command now processes --help and --version long arguments.

* The texinfo manual is out-of-date.  Please use the `--help' option for
  correct information about command-line arguments.

* Message catalogs for French and German exist, but are out-of-date.

* `mkid' and `idx' use a file-tree walker.  Give them one or more directory
  names on the command-line, and they'll recursively descend looking for
  source files.  lib/language.map (installe as $(prefix)/share/language.map)
  contains patterns for mapping file names to the appropriate language scanner.

* id-utils now uses automake.

* gid, aid and eid are now shell-script wrappers that
  call `lid' with the apropriate argument.

* A new environment `IDPATH' contains a colon-separated list of ID file
  names for use by `fid' and `lid'.  It is only partially implemented at
  this time only the first ID file is actually handled, the rest are
  ignored.

* pid is temporarily gone, but will reappear soon.

* iid has been removed from the distribution.

* Support for non-ANSI compilers is broken.  Don't expect it to work.
  If you use gcc, all will be well.

* Miscellaneous bugs are fixed.

Version 3.0 - February 1995, by Greg McGary

* `mkid' uses a new efficient algorithm for building the database.  The old
  algorithm was O(n^2) for space and would exhaust memory or lead to page
  thrashing on very large programs.  The new algorithm is linear with the
  size of the input for both time and space.  It is now possible to build
  very large `mkid' databases covering many thousands of files totalling
  tens of megabytes and containing hundreds of thousands of unique tokens.

* The database header is now byte-order and word-size independent.  ID
  files may be shared across networks of dissimilar architectures.
