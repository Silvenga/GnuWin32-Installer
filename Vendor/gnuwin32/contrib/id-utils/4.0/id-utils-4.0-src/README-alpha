id-utils-4.0 Special instructions for pre-release testers
---------------------------------------------------------

 * The code has been substantially changed.
   Portability problems might remain.

 * Please report your successes/problems along with your operating system,
   compiler, and possibly other relevant information. 

 Information that follows this small section is out of date,

id-utils-3.x Special instructions for pre-release testers
  (WARNING! Out of date, for reference only)

* The code is pretty solid, but portability problems might remain.

  I have already successfully configured, built and run `make check' on the
  following systems, so if you have limited time, you needn't go out of
  your way to retest them:

  sparc-sun-solaris2.6		gcc
  sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1	gcc
  sparc-sun-sunos4.1.4		gcc & vendor cc (k&r)
  i386-pc-solaris2.5.1		gcc
  i386-pc-solaris2.6		gcc
  i586-pc-linux-gnu		gcc
  i386-pc-bsdi4.0		gcc
  i386-unknown-freebsd2.2.7	gcc
  i386-unknown-netbsd1.3.1	gcc
  hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.04		gcc & vendor cc
  mips-sgi-irix6.2		gcc & vendor cc

  I always used GNU make.  The vendor-supplied make failed on HP/UX and
  IRIX.  I didn't debug the vendor make failures, which is properly the
  domain of automake.

* At least do this:

	./configure --prefix test; make all; make check; make install.

  Make check should "echo OK" if it succeeded.  This is not a very rigorous
  test, but it at least ensures sanity for the core tools.
  If all goes well and you want to start using it, reconfigure to install
  in a normal place, e.g.,

	 # put things in /usr/local/{bin,lib,info} (the default)
	./configure; make install
		-or-
	 # put things in /usr/{bin,lib,info}
	./configure --prefix /usr; make install

  If you have the time, patience and software, please build using both your
  vendor-supplied compiler and gcc.  By default, configure will use gcc if
  it is available.  You can override this by doing this:

	make distclean
	CC=vendor-supplied-cc ./configure	# bourne-shell syntax
		-or-
	setenv CC vendor-supplied-cc; ./configure # csh syntax


* If you run into build problems, please help by emailing me the following:
  * A brilliant, elegant patch to fix it. ;-)
  -- or, if you don't have time for that... --
  * The version of mkid you're trying to build
    (type ./mkid to get the usage banner which includes the version)
  * The output of "make -k all", to show me where it's dying.
  * The output of "uname -a"
  * The output of "nm" on your system's libc, if applicable.

  Send bug reports directly to me: gkm@gnu.org

* Be aware that this is still work in progress.  See TODO for a list of
  things yet undone.

* If you have contributed enhacements or fixes but don't find yourself
  mentioned in the THANKS file, please bring it to my attention.

Thanks!
Greg
