* DeRoff-2.0 for Windows *
==========================

What is it?
-----------
Deroff: remove roff, tbl, eqn, refer and pic constructs from documents

Description
-----------
Deroff removes roff constructs from documents for the purpose of indexing,
spell checking etc. This implementation is a little smarter than traditional
implementations, because it knows about certain -man and -mm macros. It is
able to generate a word list for spell checking tools or omit headers for
sentence analysis tools. It can further generate cpp-style #line lines.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in deroff-2.0-GnuWin32.diffs in deroff-2.0-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
