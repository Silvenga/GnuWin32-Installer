These are Paul Haeberli routines that ANgus has modified as examples
of how you can customise his work.

izooms is the same as izoom except you specify the size of the
new imgae and not the relative scale factors

caglue is like cglue except it adds an rgb to an intensity image to
make an rgba image

fixdim is used to get rid of the "img_seek: weird dim" error
message that is so irritating
