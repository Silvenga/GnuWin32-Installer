============================

What is it?
-----------
Img2Ps: convert a PNM or JPEG image to Postscript-2

Description
-----------
imgtops2 is a utility for converting images to PostScript Level 2.
Level 2 supports more efficient encoding of image data than the original
PostScript standard, so the files produced by imgtops2 are significantly
smaller than those made by pnmtops of the PBMPlus package or convert of
the ImageMagick package. This is especially true of JPEG files, which
Level 2 can handle directly but Level 1 implementations must first
decompress. Level 2 PostScript has been the standard for almost a decade
now (Level 3 is actually out now), so nearly all printers support it.
