Part of gif2png (the file 437_l1.c) was generated by the `trans'
program written by Kosta Kostis <kosta@live.robin.de>.  This package
(a great source for character conversion tables) is available as

	ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/doc/ISO/charsets/transXXX.tar.gz

where XXX is replaced by a version number.

The PNG specification is available from
<http://www.cdrom.com/png/>. Obviously, without the PNG effort this
program wouldn't have been possible or necessary (or even
conceivable).
