pngcheck version 1.99.3 of 2 September 2000

I believe this is the fourth or fifth major release since version 1.98,
which is when I took over maintenance of pngcheck from Alexander Lehmann
and Andreas Dilger.  Enhancements since 1.98 include:  zlib capability
(to be able to print out the line filters for each line of the image);
information on the compression factor of the image (expressed as a per-
centage, where 0% is no compression and 100% would be total compression--
note that this can be negative since it counts PNG's chunk overhead against
the compression factor); extended support for printing palettes (includes
transparency info and histograms now); support for all known PNG chunks;
support for JNG images conforming to Draft 70 or later; partial support
for MNG streams conforming to Draft 64 or later; and support for MSVC
compilation under Win32.  It also contains a fix from Tom Lane for a bug
in the pHYs-reporting code.

Improved ("finished") support for MNG is coming relatively soon, at which
point the version number will finally reach 2.0, but I won't make any
promises as to when.  Support for EBCDIC-based systems will show up some-
day, too.  DOS/Win32 wildcards should already be supported, at least in
the distributed binaries.

See http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/apps/pngcheck.html for updates.
