==========================

What is it?
-----------
Mawk: pattern scanning and text processing language

Description
-----------
mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. mawk is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) mawk conforms to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk provides a small number of extensions.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in mawk-1.3.3-GnuWin32.diffs in mawk-1.3.3-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
