Installation on Mingw32:

See file INSTALL.

When configuring with the default options, the build will attempt to create
shared libraries and fail because libtool 1.4.3 does not support shared
libraries on Mingw32.  To remedy:
  - Either configure with option --disable-shared, to create non-shared
    libraries only.
  - Or update this package with the libtool CVS, and configure normally.
