* Gd-2.0.33 for Windows *
=========================

What is it?
-----------
Gd: graphics library for fast image creation

Description
-----------
gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or
JPEG file. This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications,
where PNG and JPEG are two of the formats accepted for inline images
by most browsers. 

gd is not a paint program. If you are looking for a paint program, you
are looking in the wrong place. If you are not a programmer, you are
looking in the wrong place, unless you are installing a required library
in order to run an application. 

gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics operation. It
is not necessary or desirable for gd to become a kitchen-sink graphics
package, but version 2.0 does include most frequently requested features,
including both truecolor and palette images, resampling (smooth resizing
of truecolor images) and so forth.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in gd-2.0.33-1-GnuWin32.diffs in gd-2.0.33-1-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
