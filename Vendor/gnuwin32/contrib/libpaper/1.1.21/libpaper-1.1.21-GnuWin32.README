* LibPaper-1.1.21 for Windows *
===============================

What is it?
-----------
LibPaper: library and tools for handling papersize

Description
-----------
The paper library and accompanying files are intended to provide a simple way for applications to take actions based on a system- or user-specified paper size. It lets program automatically recognize a lot of different papers with their properties (actually their size). It also includes a program for accessing paper information from shell scripts. This release is quite minimal, its purpose being to provide really basic functions (obtaining the system paper name and getting the height and width of a given kond of paper) that applications can immediately integrate.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in libpaper-1.1.21-GnuWin32.diffs in libpaper-1.1.21-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
