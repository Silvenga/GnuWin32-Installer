Michael D. Brennan provided considerable inspiration with his excellent
Mawk product.  Awka owes to Mawk the configure scripts, the AWK language
parser, and the idea that the language could be implemented for high 
performance.

Thanks also to Arnold Robbins, maintainer of Gawk, for his ongoing encouragement
and helpfulness.  The extensive test suite in Awka is mostly based on Gawk's 
test suite and Gawk has led the way in new functionality, particularly with
version 3.1.0.  The inet and coprocess functions in Awka were drawn directly
from Gawk, and were originally developed by Jürgen Kahrs.

Thanks to the many contributors to comp.lang.awk who made it clear that 
a freely available awk-to-C translator was needed.

Finally, thanks in advance to everyone who reports bugs or offers 
suggestions or constructive criticism, along with those who have already
contributed.

I along with everyone who uses Awka, owe special thanks to people who
have contributed with bug reports, suggestions and patches.  Awka would
be a far poorer product without their help and encouragement.  I've listed
these fine folk below in no particular order, and apologise if I've missed 
anybody...
