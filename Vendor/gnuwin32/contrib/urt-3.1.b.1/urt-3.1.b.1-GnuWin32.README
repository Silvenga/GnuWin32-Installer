* URT-3.1.b.1 for Windows *
===========================

What is it?
-----------
URT: library and tools for URT images

Description
-----------
The Utah Raster Toolkit is a collection of programs and C routines for
dealing with raster images commonly encountered in computer graphics.
A device and system independent image format stores images and information
about them. Called the RLE(5) format, it uses run length encoding to
reduce storage space for most images. 
The programs (tools) currently included in the toolkit are listed above,
together with a short description of each one. Most of the tools read one
or more input RLE files and produce an output RLE file. Some generate RLE
files from other information, and some read RLE files and produce output
of a different form.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in urt-3.1.b.1-GnuWin32.diffs in urt-3.1.b.1-2-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
