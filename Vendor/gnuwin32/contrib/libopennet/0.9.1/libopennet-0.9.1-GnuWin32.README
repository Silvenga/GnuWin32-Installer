================================

What is it?
-----------
LibOpennet: URL handling library

Description
-----------
Opennet is a library to provide an easy mechanism to
open and handle URLs in the same way you would open and
handle a regular file. The very first function that
must be called in your program is opennet_init(3) (for
win32 compatability).

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in libopennet-0.9.1-GnuWin32.diffs in libopennet-0.9.1-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
