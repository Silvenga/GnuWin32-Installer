This fork of LibOLE2 is taken directly from the 
GNOME CVS repository.  Once Dom Lachowicz and Michael Meeks agree on the
future of libole2, this will cease being a forked copy of libole2.

You can browse their source at http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/libole2/ or
check it out from the GNOME CVS repository.  The module name is libole2, 
and you can find GNOME CVS instructions at 
http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/libole2/.
