* Wv-1.0.2 for Windows *
========================

What is it?
-----------
Wv:

Description
-----------
wv is a library which allows access to Microsoft Word files. It can load
and parse Word 2000, 97, 95 and 6 file formats. (These are the file
formats known internally as Word 9, 8, 7 and 6.) There is some support
for reading earlier formats as well: Word 2 docs are converted to
plaintext.

Provided with the wv distribution is an application called wvWare.
wvWare is a "power-user" application with lots of command-line options,
doo-dads, bells, and whistles. Less interesting, but more convenient,
are the helper scripts that use wvWare. These are: 

- wvHtml: convert your Word document into HTML4.0 
- wvLatex: convert your Word document into visually (pretty) correct LaTeX 
- wvCleanLatex: convert into 'cleaner' LaTeX containing less visual mark-up,
  more suitable for further use and LyX import. Work in progress 
- wvDVI: converts word to DVI. Requires 'latex' 
- wvPS: converts word to PostScript. Requires 'dvips' 
- wvPDF: converts word to Adobe PDF. Requires 'distill' from Adobe [Someone
  do a pdflatex or pdfhtml version :-)] 
- wvText: converts word to plain text. Textually correct output requires
  'lynx.' For poor output, this doesn't require anything special. 
- wvAbw: converts word to Abiword format. (Far better just to use Abiword.) 
- wvWml: converts word to WML for viewing on portable devices like WebPhones
  and Palm Pilots. 
- wvRtf: a basic version exists 
- wvMime: can be plugged as a MIME helper application into your browser/mail
  client; presents the document on-screen inside GhostView, while all
  intermediate files generated go into the /tmp directory.

Package Availability
--------------------
- in: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net

Sources
-------
- wv-1.0.2-src.zip

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in wv-1.0.2-GnuWin32.diffs in wv-1.0.2-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
