What is it?
-----------
Tiff: library and tools for TIFF images

Description
-----------
This software provides support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a widely used format for storing image data. The latest version of the TIFF specification is available on-line in several different formats, as are a number of Technical Notes (TTN's). Included in this software distribution is a library, libtiff, for reading and writing TIFF, a small collection of tools for doing simple manipulations of TIFF images on UNIX systems, and documentation on the library and tools. A small assortment of TIFF-related software for UNIX that has been contributed by others is also included. The library, along with associated tool programs, should handle most of your needs for reading and writing TIFF images on 32- and 64-bit machines. This software can also be used on older 16-bit systems though it may require some effort and you may need to leave out some of the compression support. The GnuWin32 distribution comes in two versions. The ordinary version uses the standard Unix equivalents, such as fopen and read, for input and output, the other version (Tiff-win32<http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff-win32.htm>) uses the Win32 API functions, such as CreateFile and ReadFile, for input and output. The ordinary version (Tiff<http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm>) is more suitable for porting Unix programs, the Win32-API version is more suitable for writing Win32 programs.

Package Availability
--------------------
- in: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net
Installation
------------

Sources
-------
- tiff-3.8.2-1-src.zip

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in tiff-3.8.2-1-GnuWin32.diffs in tiff-3.8.2-1-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
