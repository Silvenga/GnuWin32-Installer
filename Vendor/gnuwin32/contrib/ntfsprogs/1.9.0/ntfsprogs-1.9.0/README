Linux-NTFS
==========

The Linux-NTFS project aims to bring full support for the NTFS filesystem to
the Linux operating system.

Linux-NTFS project, including the ntfsprogs package containing the NTFS library
(libntfs) and the NTFS utilities (ntfsprogs) and the Linux kernel NTFS driver
are copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote them.
 
The Linux-NTFS ntfsprogs package currently consists of the NTFS library
(libntfs), the NTFS Gnome VFS module (libntfs-gnomevfs), and various utilities
(ntfsprogs).

If you would like to take part in the development of Linux-NTFS, you are
invited to subscribe to the development mailing list,
linux-ntfs-dev@lists.sourceforge.net.  The easiest way to do this is to visit
the list page on SourceForge at:

If you would like to be kept up to date about new releases and other Linux-NTFS
announcements, subscribe to the linux-ntfs-announce mailing list (very low
volume).  The easiest way to do this is to visit the list page on SourceForge

Quick Installation
==================

   In most cases it should be sufficient to do:

	./configure
	make
	make install	<-- You usually need to be root for this one.

The above will compile and install the NTFS library and utility programs into
/usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin respectively.  The man pages will be
installed by default in /usr/local/man.

For more detailed installation instructions, please read the file INSTALL.

Note, if you want to enable the additional debugging checks in the code as well
as the output of debugging information, which will be emitted to stdout, you
need to specify the `--enable-debug' option to `configure'.

NTFS library
============

Provides common NTFS access functions to the ntfsprogs and other foreign
open source applications.  Note, that the library is still under development
and a lot of functionality is not yet included.

NTFS Gnome VFS module
=====================

The Gnome virtual filesystem provides universal access to diffent filesystems.
This modules enables Gnome VFS clients to seamlessly utilize the NTFS library.
For further details and examples of how to make use of the NTFS Gnome VFS
module in practice see man 8 libntfs-gnomevfs.

NTFS utilities
==============

The ntfsprogs will eventually include utilities for doing all required tasks
to NTFS partitions.  In general, just run a utility without any command line
options to display the version number and usage syntax.

The following utilities are so far implemented:

NtfsFix - Attempt to fix an NTFS partition that has been damaged by the old
Linux NTFS driver.  Note that you should run it every time after you have used
the old Linux NTFS driver to write to an NTFS partition to prevent massive data
corruption from happening when Windows mounts the partition.
IMPORTANT: Run this only *after* unmounting the partition in Linux but *before*
rebooting into Windows NT/2000 or you *will* suffer! - You have been warned!
See man 8 ntfsfix for details.

mkntfs - Format a partition with the NTFS filesystem.  See man 8 mkntfs for
command line options.

ntfslabel - Display/change the label of an NTFS partition.  See man 8 ntfslabel
for details.

ntfsundelete - Recover deleted files from an NTFS volume.  See man 8
ntfsundelete for more details.

ntfsresize - Resize NTFS volumes.  See man 8 ntfsresize for details.

ntfsclone - Efficiently create/restore an image of an NTFS partition.  See
man 8 ntfsclone for details.

ntfscluster - Locate the owner of any given sector or cluster on an NTFS
partition.  See man 8 ntfscluster for details.

ntfsinfo - Show some information about an NTFS partition or one of the files
or directories within it.  See man 8 ntfsinfo for details.

ntfsls - List information about files in a directory residing on an NTFS
partition.  See man 8 ntfsls for details.

ntfscat - Concatenate files and print their contents on the standard output.
