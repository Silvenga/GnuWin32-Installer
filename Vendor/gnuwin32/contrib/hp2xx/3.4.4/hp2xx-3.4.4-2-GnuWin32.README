Hp2xx: convert HP-GL plotter language files

Description
-----------
The hp2xx program is a versatile tool to convert vector-oriented graphics
data given in Hewlett-Packard's HP-GL plotter language into a variety of
popular graphics formats, both vector- and raster-oriented. 

The various supported output formats include Encapsulated PostScript (EPS),
PCX, IMG, and several formats intended to facilitate the generation of
graphics within TeX documents. In addition, hp2xx output is printable on
the HP Laserjet/ Deskjet printer series, and it may be used as a HP-GL
previewer on many platforms, e.g., X11 and DOS (VGA). 

hp2xx first converts all HP-GL data into pure vectors and buffers them
internally. It then converts these vectors into a specified output format
(vector modes), or rasterizes them (raster modes) on an internal bitmap.
In raster modes, hp2xx then translates the bitmap into the output format.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in hp2xx-3.4.4-2-GnuWin32.diffs in hp2xx-3.4.4-2-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
