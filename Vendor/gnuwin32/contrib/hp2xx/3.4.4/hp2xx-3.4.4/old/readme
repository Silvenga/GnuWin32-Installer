to_atari.c     Replaced by newer release by A. Schwab
to_mf.c        Replaced by newer release (additions by J. Eggers:
               ``mode -m cs'' to TeX-related outputs on ATARI platforms)
to_pbm.c       Replaced by newer release (additions by Ian McPhedran)
to_x11a.c      Alternative version of X.11 previewer "to_x11.c" with
               modifications by E.K.Sorensen. Its window closes by
               double-clicking the upper left corner instead of typing
               <Ret> in the shell window.
               I found this version somewhat incompatible with SunOS's
               window manager olwm, so I put it here, but it might
               work fine on "raw" X.11 platforms...
