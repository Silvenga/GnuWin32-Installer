For installation,

  o  select the makefile template most closely resembling
     your system's needs. On Unix systems, use "generic.mak".
     
  o  copy it to ../sources/makefile. The Makefile that is originally 
     installed there as part of the source distribution is what i use
     for development on Linux systems.

  o  cd ../sources

  o  manually adapt (edit) makefile. Sorry - installation procedure is only
     beginning to evolve here due to lack of test facilities.

     The special makefiles should hardly need any modification. Edit them
     only if they don't work right away.

     For the generic makefile, there are three configuration steps:

       1) Site-specific changes:

          -- Change the (prefix) definition to where you want to install hp2xx.
          -- Change the compiler (CC) and the compiler switches (CFLAGS).
             The defaults use gcc, of course.
          -- If needed, add library paths and include paths (LDFLAGS, CPPFLAGS).

       2) System-specific changes:

          -- Main configuration step:

             Un-comment the definitions for your target system
             and comment-out the default definitions.

             If your system is not listed, try the defaults first, and modify
             them if needed. Study the other systems' settings to get an idea
             of what modification may be necessary.

       3) Optional additions:
	  Optionally select support for TIFF and/or PNG output by un-commenting
	  the appropriate definitions. Both require additional libraries, which
	  are available from www.libtiff.org and www.libpng.org, respectively.
          Libpng (and potentially also libtiff, depending on which options
	  you chose for it) also requires zlib for compression algorithms,
	  the libpng website should contain a pointer to it.
	  Users of Epson Stylus family inkjets may add the preliminary 
	  support provided by the to_escp2 module. Printing is currently
	  very slow due to the use of only one line of nozzles, so piping
	  the output of the postscript module into ghostscript might be a
	  better choice.
	  Optionally add support for modes PIC and PAC by un-commenting
          the appropriate lines. These formats appear to have been
	  quite popular in the Atari world once, and the code for them
 	  in hp2xx dates back to Werntges' original version.


  o  Run "make all" from ../sources. This should result in a binary file.

  o  Optionally run a few tests using the HP-GL files in ../hp-tests

  o  INSTALLATION:

     Either put this file somewhere on the search path,
     etc. in /usr/local/bin, or run "make install-bin" (if provided).

     Optionally install the documentation (see ../doc/README). If provided
     (generic makefile), use

          -- "make install-man"  to install the manual page,
          -- "make install-info" to install the info file (recommended)

     NOTE:
          -- "make install" installs both the binary and all docs.

  o  Optionally run "make clean" (not always provided).
