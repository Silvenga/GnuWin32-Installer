Quick guide through hp2xx
=========================


Welcome to hp2xx, the HP-GL converter!


Each subdirectory within hp2xx contains a local README file. There you find
a short description on each file and/or directory found therein, as well as
instructions and other comments on what matters at that point.

Besides these basic instructions, a detailed manual is provided in
./doc/hp2xxinf.tex (UNIX: hp2xx.texinfo).



For installation,

o  follow the instructions starting in ./makes/README

o  optionally, see ./doc/hp2xxinf.tex (Manual in texinfo format)

That's all, folks. Enjoy!
