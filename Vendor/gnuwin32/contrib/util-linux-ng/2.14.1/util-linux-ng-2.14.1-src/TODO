v2.15:
=====

 * add libfsprobe (see topic/fsprobe branch)

 * swapon -s  -- LABELs support

   Although mkswap has recently been -L option to create a label nothing appears to
   have been change to swapon to display said labels. (rh#430386)

 * try improve compilation against others libc:
	- klibc
	- ???

 * use rpmatch() for all Y/N questions

 * mount -a -- reorder fstab entries by paths before mount (just idea only)

 * mount -a  (just idea only)

	In the past the right record order could be figured out easily by just
	checking out fstab (if one knew what to look for) but considering the
	fastly increasing number of user space file systems and their usage, with
	their path, library, etc dependencies, it's getting trickier and is a black
	magic for most users because they simply expect drives to be mounted
	independently of their order in fstab.

	One typical, wrongly edited fstab example is:

	  /dev/hda2 /             ext3      defaults  1 1
	  /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows  ntfs-3g   defaults  0 0
	  /dev/hda3 /usr          ext3      defaults  0 0

	The events:

	  mount  ->  /sbin/mount.ntfs-3g  ->
		 ->  resolves to <path1>/ntfs-3g via a symlink ->
		 ->  ntfs-3g requires at least <path2>/libfuse*

	There are many potential solutions. For example installing everything on
	the root file system which may be needed for successful mount. But this
	is not always feasible or practical since we could end up putting almost
	everything on the root file system in the end.

	Another idea is an improved mount strategy:

	  do {
		try to mount all unmounted entries
	  } while (not all mounted && at least one new was successfully mounted)

v2.??:
=====

 * rewrite ipcs to use /proc/sys/kernel rather than unreliable syscalls
   (there are problems with 32bit userspace on 64bit kernel)

 * minix v3

	It seems that the kernel has support for minix fs v3
	(though I have not tried it, just inspected some code when
	trying to find a mkfs.minix issue).
	It might be worth a thought implementing v3 support
	(though I am not really sure how much people us minix fs ;-)
	This might require some major code cleanup in mkfs.minix.
