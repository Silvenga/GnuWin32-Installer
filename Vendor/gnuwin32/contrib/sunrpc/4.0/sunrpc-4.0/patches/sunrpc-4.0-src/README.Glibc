# The code in this subdirectory is taken from Sun's RPCSRC-4.0
# distribution with some additional changes from the TI-RPC package
# which is also available from Sun.  The files are heavily changed to
# compile cleanly and to fit in the GNU environment.  All the code
# from Sun's rpc, etc, and rpcgen subdirectories is in this directory;
# the rpc subdirectory contains only the header files.  Other than
# that, several files were renamed so as not to exceed 14-character
# file name limits:
#
#	authunix_prot.c -> authuxprot.c
#	bindresvport.c -> bindrsvprt.c
#	clnt_generic.c -> clnt_gen.c
#	clnt_perror.c -> clnt_perr.c
#	clnt_simple.c -> clnt_simp.c
#	get_myaddress.c -> get_myaddr.c
#	pmap_getmaps.c -> pm_getmaps.c
#	pmap_getport.c -> pm_getport.c
#	rpc_callmsg.c -> rpc_cmsg.c
#	rpc_commondata.c -> rpc_common.c
#	rpc_dtablesize.c -> rpc_dtable.c
#	svc_auth_unix.c -> svc_authux.c
#	xdr_reference.c -> xdr_ref.c
