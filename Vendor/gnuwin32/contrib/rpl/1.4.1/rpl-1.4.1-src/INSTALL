If you used RPM to install then skip this section.

As of 1.4.1 rpl has moved to the GNU Autoconf system for building. Hopefully
this move will be painless. If you experience any problems please email the
address below.

To build rpl type ./configure in the rpl directory. (Type ./configure --help
to see some options, mainly standard stuff...) The default install will put 
rpl in /usr/local/bin and the man page in /usr/local/man/man1. If you want 
these elsewhere see ./configure --help.

After executing configure simply type "make". Finally, to install rpl type 
"make install". You probably want to be root to install unless you specified
some other location (like your own bin dir).

If you have trouble, find a bug, or would like to improve/enhance rpl please
e-mail software@laffeycomputer.com

Thanks!
