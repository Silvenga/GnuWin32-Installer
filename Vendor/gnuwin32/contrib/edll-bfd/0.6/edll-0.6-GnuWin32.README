* Edll-0.6 for Windows *
========================

What is it?
-----------
Edll: EnhancedDLL -- to have plugins and libraries with undefined symbols

Description
-----------
edll is a new way to create plugins under Microsoft windows avoiding the creation of DLLs altogether. The first advantage is to not have to create libraries with all of their symbols declared at link time. Actually, edll does not require you to link anything, only to create object files. You can use the linker to merge multiple object files and archive libraries (.a files) into one plugin though. The main reason why edll was created is to replicate on Windows (Win32) the use of the ltdl library available under most Unix platforms. That is, allow undefined symbols in any of your plugins and even the possibility to link back to the main executable.

Package Availability
--------------------
- in: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net

Sources
-------
- edll-0.6-src.zip

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in edll-0.6-GnuWin32.diffs in edll-0.6-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
