Alexis Wilke	EDLL was created by Alexis Wilke in April 2005.

Patric Stout	Patric helped in fixing several bugs in version 0.2.
		He also created a broken up version of the large edll.c file.
		And later he helped in fixing the relocation function so it
		could use the BFD library instead of the edll doing it on
		its own.
