* Enscript-1.6.3 for Windows *
==============================

What is it?
-----------
Enscript: convert text files to PostScript, HTML, RTF, ANSI, and overstrikes

Description
-----------
Enscript converts text files to PostScript or to other
output languages. Enscript can spool the generated out-
put directly to a specified printer or leave it to a
file. If no input files are given, enscript processes
the standard input stdin. Enscript can be extended to
handle different output media and it has many options
which can be used to customize the printouts.

Package Availability
--------------------
- in: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23617
- as:
  - enscript-1.6.3-8-bin.zip

Installation
------------
With the -E option, enscript may give the error: "The system cannot find
the path specified." This occurs when it cannot find the auxiliary
program states.exe. To solve this, you must change the configuration file
enscript.cfg (in etc and/or in %HOME%). You must either uncomment the line,
starting with StatesPath, with the path to states.exe or give the correct
full path. Do similarly for the line starting with StatesConfigFile.

With the -f (--font-name) option, enscript may give the error: "Couldn't
open AFM file for font <font-name>, using default." This occurs when
it cannot find the font-metrics file. To solve this, you must change the
configuration file enscript.cfg (in etc and/or in %HOME%). On the line
starting with AFMPath, you must give the correct full path to the folder
with the font-metrics file and the file font.map.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in enscript-1.6.3-GnuWin32.diffs in enscript-1.6.3-8-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
