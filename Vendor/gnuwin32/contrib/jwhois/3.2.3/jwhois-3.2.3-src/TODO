"J.J.Bailey" <jjb@bcc.com>:     i'd like to have an infinite cache someplace for reference.  i suggest
    using zero as the expire time to do this.
    
    ip allocations change far less frequently than domain information.  i
    suggest adding a second expire value for ip entries in the cache.  for
    example, i'd use 720 hours for domain info and 4320 hours for ip info.
