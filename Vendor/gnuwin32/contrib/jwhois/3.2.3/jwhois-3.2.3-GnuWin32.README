* Jwhois-3.2.3 for Windows *
============================

What is it?
-----------
Jwhois: client for the whois service

Description
-----------
JWHOIS is an Internet Whois client that contains an extensible
configuration file which defines its operation. The client supports
queries to foreign hosts either through the RFC 954 - NICNAME/WHOIS
protocol, the RFC 2167 - Referral Whois 1.5 protocol, or HTTP using
an external browser. 

Upon execution, JWHOIS searches through the its configuration to find
the most specific whois server to query. Depending upon the reply from
that whois server, JWHOIS can assume the query was successfull and
display the result to the user, or optionally redirect the query to
another server to find more specific information.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in jwhois-3.2.3-GnuWin32.diffs in jwhois-3.2.3-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
