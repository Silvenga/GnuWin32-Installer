Glpk: GNU Linear Programming Kit

Description
-----------
GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) is intended for solving large scale linear programming problems by means of the revised simplex method. It is a set of routines written in ANSI C and organized in the form of a library. It is intended for solving large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer linear programming (MIP), and other related problems. GLPK has the following main features: - implementation of the revised simplex method (based on sparse matrix technique, steepest edge pricing, and two-pass pivoting technique); - implementation of the primal-dual interior point method; - implementation of the branch-and-bound procedure (based on the dual simplex method); - application program interface (API); - Stand-alone LP/MIP solver.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in glpk-4.34-GnuWin32.diffs in glpk-4.34-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
