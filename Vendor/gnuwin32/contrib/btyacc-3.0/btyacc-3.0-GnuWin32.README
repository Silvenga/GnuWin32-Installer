* BtYacc-3.0 for Windows *
==========================

What is it?
-----------
BtYacc: an LALR(1) parser generator

Description
-----------
BtYacc is a hacked version of the original Berkeley "byacc". The main
change to byacc is the addition of backtracking code, allowing you to
try both alternatives in case of shift-reduce or reduce-reduce conflicts.
As long as no backtracking takes place, speed is comparable to bison. 

Additional features: 

 - enhanced support for storing of text position information for tokens
 - closes the potential *yacc/bison memory leak during error recovery
 - preprocessor directives like %ifdef, %include
 - C++ friendly

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in btyacc-3.0-GnuWin32.diffs in btyacc-3.0-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
