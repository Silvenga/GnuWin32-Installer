What is it?
-----------
SharUtils: create and unpack shell archives

Description
-----------
GNU shar makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
them for transmission by electronic mail services. A shell archive
is a collection of files that can be unpacked by /bin/sh. A wide
range of features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing
shars and in specifying shar smartness. For example, shar may compress
files, uuencode binary files, split long files and construct multi-part
mailings, ensure correct unsharing order, and provide simplistic checksums. 

GNU unshar scans a set of mail messages looking for the start of shell
archives. It will automatically strip off the mail headers and other
introductory text. The archive bodies are then unpacked by a copy of the
shell. unshar may also process files containing concatenated
shell archives.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in sharutils-4.2.1-3-GnuWin32.diffs in sharutils-4.2.1-3-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
