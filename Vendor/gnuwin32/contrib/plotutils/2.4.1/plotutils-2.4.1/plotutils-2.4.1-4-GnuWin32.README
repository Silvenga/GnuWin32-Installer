* PlotUtils-2.4.1 for Windows *
===============================

What is it?
-----------
PlotUtils: plotting utilities and library

Description
-----------
The GNU plotutils package contains software for both programmers and
technical users. Its centerpiece is libplot, a powerful C/C++ function
library for exporting 2-D vector graphics in many file formats, both
vector and raster. It can also do vector graphics animations. libplot
is device-independent in the sense that its API (application programming
interface) does not depend on the type of graphics file to be exported.
Besides libplot, the package contains command-line programs for plotting
scientific data. Many of them use libplot to export graphics. The program
also contains the following command-line programs for plotting scientific
data:

- graph: plots 2-D datasets or data streams in real time
- plot: translates metafile formats to any of the other formats
- tek2plot: translates legacy Textronix data to any of the above formats
- pic2plot: translates the pic language to any of the other formats
- plotfont: displays character maps of the fonts available in the above formats
- spline: spline interpolation of data
- ode: numerically integrates ordinary differential equations

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in plotutils-2.4.1-4-GnuWin32.diffs in plotutils-2.4.1-4-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
