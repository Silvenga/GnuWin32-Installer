This directory contains libcommon, a library of miscellaneous support
functions, which is statically linked with several of the package
executables.  It also contains the file fontlist.c, which is symlinked into
the home directory of each of the executables at build time.

The reason fontlist.c is not in a convenience library of its own (as it
used to be) is that it accesses internal, undocumented data structures of
libplot.  On AIX systems, it seems libtool can't link the executables with
both a `libfontlist' and libplot, due to some AIX foolishness about
libraries not being allowed to contain undefined symbols.
