                  XML version 1 parser for Gnome

This is the old parser, the new version libxml2 is in the CVS head of
the gnome-xml module.
This parser embbed the old 1.8.11 parser and a new one based on 2.3.5
which is far more compliant. You can toggle libxml to use the new parser
by using xmlUseNewParser(1) or setting up the LIBXML_USE_NEW_PARSER
environment variable. The old parser is the default and can be forced
by calling xmlUseNewParser(0) or setting up the LIBXML_USE_OLD_PARSER
environment variable.
