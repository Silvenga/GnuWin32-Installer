	Possible enhancements that I'd like to add

* verbose mode, printing position information to stderr

* document how a new encoding standard can be added

* add Barcode_String, which has been contributed

* EAN128 (as agreed with Dani Pardo)

* Postnet and associated encoding-specific bar definitions

* Use texinfo 4 with images

* shrink the bars to account for ink spreading

	Currently, small barcodes don't get rendered well. While
	version 0.91 and later subtracts 0.15 points from the size of
	the bars (I found that this makes good results for small
	bars), a smart alghorithm to shrink the bars is needed to get
	lighter prints at small sizes without loosing readability.
