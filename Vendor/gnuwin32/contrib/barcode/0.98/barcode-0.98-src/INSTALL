Installing on generic Unix systems
----------------------------------

The package includes both a library and a standalone program.
To install everything try

	./configure && make && make install

To uninstall, try

	make uninstall

You may have problems compiling the package on non-GNUish systems,
because the tool currently uses both gmake and gawk features, and I have
no access to non-gnu systems. If your operating system isn't able to
compile barcode and you are willing to help porting, feel free to call me.


Installing on Debian/GNU systems
--------------------------------

The suggested installation here includes creation of a Debian package:

	debian/rules binary

Then, just install using dpkg:

	dpkg -i ../barcode-0.98_*.deb

(the "*" here will represent your architecture: "i386", "alpha", "sparc", ...)
