The Debian Package barcode
----------------------------

This Debian package is integrated in the upstream release of GNU
barcode, maintained by Alessandro Rubini (rubini@gnu.org,
rubini@prosa.it).  Since I have no extended experience with Debian
packages, I'm willing to accept any fixes that seem fit, as well as a
real Debian maintainer for the Debian package.
