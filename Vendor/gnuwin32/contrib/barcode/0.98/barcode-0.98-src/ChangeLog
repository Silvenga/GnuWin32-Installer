2002-03-01  Alessandro Rubini  <rubini@linux.it>

	* library.c (Barcode_Encode): handle bitsets separately, like
		in Barcode_Print (otherwise, you might loose NO_CHECKSUM).

	* debian/changelog: moved to 0.98 (but should fix all debian/ stuff)

	* contrib/barcode-for-delphi.tar.gz: new, contributed by Michael Geddes

	* contrib/barcode-for-delphi.tar.gz.README: short info for file above

	* main.c (main): allow "-g" to set size of code in a table as well
		-- suggested and initiallt implemented by Joachim Reichelt.
	(main): fixed missing "Page: 1 1" in postscript for tables
	(main): for tables don't use Encode_and_Print, use a local
		unrolled version, so the default margin can be removed and
		we avoid problems with negative xoff in the output phase
		(first column may be offset, as noted by Karl Magnus Kolstoe)

	* doc/doc.barcode: documented change above.
	
	* README: removed refernces to systemy.it, I'm no more there

2001-10-16  Alessandro Rubini  <rubini@linux.it>

	* doc/doc.barcode (Supported Encodings): added documentation for
		EAN and UPC with checksum, as coded by mr. Böszörményi (below)

2001-10-16  Boszormenyi Zoltan <zboszor@externet.hu>

	* ean.c: 

	I found that barcode-0.96 does not correctly encodes UPC-E.
	This was mainly because in upc_e_to_a() the switch() branches
	all ended without "break;".

	Printing UPC-E did not print the leading encoding number and
	the trailing UPC-A checksum. Now it does.

	Accept EAN-13 and EAN-8 with and without the checksum.
	So always treat 7 and 12 digit sequences as valid EAN codes
	and accept 8 and 13 digit sequences as valid EAN codes when
	the last digit is the same as the calculated one.

	Accept UPC-A as above (11 or 12 digit sequences.)

	Accepts UPC-E as:
	6 digit sequence: the middle part of the code (leading '0' assumed)
	7 digit sequence: the middle part and either a leading '0' or '1',
	    or a trailing UPC-A checksum. In that case, leading '0' assumed.
	8 digit sequence: a leading '0' or '1', middle part, checksum

	UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-13, and EAN-8 may all include
	an additional barcode to the right of the main barcode.

	As a 7 or a 12 digit sequence may be ambiguous, please remember
	that EAN is checked before UPC if you specified BARCODE_ANY.

2001-08-20  Alessandro Rubini  <rubini@linux.it>
