--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Libconfig uses GNU autoconf configure scripts to build and should build on
almost any platform.

Building it should be as easy as:
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

(note that `make' must not be BSD make, all other makes work fine.)


OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES:
	* libopennet (http://www.rkeene.org/oss/libopennet/)
	  Libopennet allows URLs to be opened as easily as files, if it is
	  available (and the --without-libopennet argument isn't passed to
	  the `configure' script) libconfig will be able to process config
	  files that are passed as URLs.
