* Readline-5.0 for Windows *
============================

What is it?
-----------
Readline: edit command lines

Description
-----------
The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are
typed in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline
library includes additional functions to maintain a list of
previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those
lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands. 

The history facilites are also placed into a separate library, the
History library, as part of the build process. The History library
may be used without Readline in applications which desire its capabilities.

Package Availability
--------------------
- in: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net

Sources
-------
- readline-5.0-src.zip

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in readline-5.0-GnuWin32.diffs in readline-5.0-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
