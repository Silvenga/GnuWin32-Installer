To run these tests, use a command sequence like:

	./=each ./=compile SRCDIR/rx/inst-rxposix.h BUILDDIR/rx/librx.a
	./=each ./=doit ,rx

substituting appropriate values for SRCDIR and BUILDDIR.

The tests can be run for GNU regex using:

	./=each ./=compile SRCDIR/rx/regex.h BUILDDIR/regex/regex.o
	./=each ./=doit ,gnu

Failed tests can be found using the commands:

	grep -s "###" */,gnu
and
	grep -s "###" */,rx

At the moment, the only known error is that GNU regex is known to fail
the backrefs test.
