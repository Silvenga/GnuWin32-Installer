* AutoConf-2.63 for Windows *
=============================

What is it?
-----------
AutoConf: creating automatic configuration scripts

Description
-----------
Extensible package of m4 macros that produce shell scripts to automatically configure software source code packages. These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf requires GNU m4. You must install GNU m4 before configuring autoconf, so that Autoconf's configure script can find it. The configuration scripts produced by auto conf are self-contained, so their users do not need to have autoconf or GNU m4.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in autoconf-2.63-GnuWin32.diffs in autoconf-2.63-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
