chsuf changes the suffix of files and/or directories.  It also can be
used to add a suffix to a list of files.

chsuf might be useful to change DOS-style three character
extensions to more readable variations (eg htm to html), or to
add an extension to filenames for later use on platforms which depend
on them.


Requirements 
------------

This program is written in Perl, so you need a working Perl5
installation on your system to use it. It is only tested on
GNU/Unix-like systems, and might only work on such a system.


Installation
------------

As of version 0.8 chsuf uses the GNU configuration tools (autoconf).
So installation works the usual way - just type in the source directory:

	./configure
	make

To install chsuf type in the source directory (as root):

	make install

To uninstall type in the source directory (as root):

	make uninstall


Documentation
-------------

After installing chsuf the documentation is available with the command:

	man chsuf

If you simply did a 'make' without installing, type (in the source directory):

	man ./chsuf.1
