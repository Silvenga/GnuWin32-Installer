* PolyglotMan-3.2 for Windows *
===============================

What is it?
-----------
PolyglotMan: convert man pages

Description
-----------
PolyglotMan takes man pages from most of the popular flavors of UNIX and
transforms them into any of a number of text source formats. In contrast to
various man2html filters, which essentially translate bold and italic text
and otherwise wrap the entire manual page in PRE tags, PolyglotMan tries
to interpret the page and produce good HTML text that can be reflowed.
Better translations are possible when working from source and some aspects
of pages, like tables, require source input, as for instance the page for
tbl itself. Several have written cgi programs for WWW to format man pages
on the fly; these are collected in the contrib directory of the distribution.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in polyglotman-3.2-GnuWin32.diffs in polyglotman-3.2-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
