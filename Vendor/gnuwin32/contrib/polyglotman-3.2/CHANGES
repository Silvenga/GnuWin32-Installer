1993
 1 Apr	as bs2tk posted to comp.lang.tcl (126 lines)
 2	bullets, change bars, copyright symbol
 5	boldface, other SGI nicks
 7	skip unrecognized escape codes
10	small caps
13	underscores considered uppercase so show up in default small caps font
	screen out Ultrix junk (code getting pretty tangled now)
14	until Tk text has better tab support, replace tabs by spaces until get to next tab stop (for Ultrix); -t gives tabstop spacing
20	Solaris support (Larry Tsui)
 3 Jun	section subheading parsing (Per-Erik Martin)
28	hyphenated man pages in SEE ALSO show up correctly in Links (Mike Steele)
13 Jul	under FILES, fully qualified path names are added to Links, but this taken out immediately because not useful
14	option to keep changebars on right (Warren Jessop)
 5 Aug	search for header, footer dynamically--no need to edit or search large list of patterns
11	-m kicks in man page formatting beyond nroff backspace kludges
27	handle double digit numbers better by trying again relative to end of line
19 Sep	-T gives Tk extras (otherwise ASCII only)
	-H gives headers only (implies -T off)
10 Oct	-r reverse compiles to [tn]roff source (as Geoff Collyer's nam and fontch, but leveraging existing analysis so only addition of ~60 lines)  (The code is device-driver obscure now--obfuscated C contest next.)
13	header and footer optionally available at bottom in Tk view (Marty Leisner)
19	"reflected" odd and even page headers&footers zapped
20	keep count of sections and subsections, using smaller font for larger numbers
 1 Nov	reverse compiles to Ensemble, except for character ranges
 4	started rman rewrite for cleaner support of multiple output targets, including: plain ascii, headers only, TkMan, [nt]roff, Ensemble, SGML, HTML
 5	line filtering separated from other logic despite greater sophistication, RosettaMan faster than bs2tk (!)
28 Dec	man page reference recognition (Michael Harrison)


1994
 1 Jan	identify descriptive lists by comparing scnt2 with s_avg
 3	tail-end table of contents in HTML documents
 5	-f <filter> and LaTeX output mode

 6 Mar	various bug fixes
10	beta version released
13 Jun	fixed surious generation on <DL>'s (the existence of which pointed out by David Sibley)
22 Jul	table recognition experiment.  works reasonably well, except for tables with centered headers
 3 Aug	allow for off-by-one (and -two) in identification of header and footer
	fixed problem with recurrent/leftover text with OSF/1 bold bullets (yeesh)
12 Sep	2.0gamma released
13	check for *third* header, possibly centered, possibly after blank lines (Charles Anderson)
	fixed tag ranges for lines following blank lines (just \n) of pages with global indentation (Owen Rees)
19	fixed two small problems with LaTeX (^ => \^, \bullet => $\bullet$) (Neal Becker)
24	simple check for erroneously being fed roff source
26	deal with bold +- as in ksh (ugh)
30	2.0delta released
 9 Oct	special check for OSF to guard against section head interpreted as footer

22	Happy Winter Solstice!  2.0 released
	deprecated gets() replaced (Robert Withrow)
25	TkMan module's $w.show => $t, saving about 9% in generated characters


1995
 1 Jan	experiment with TkMan output to take advantage of my hack to Tk text (i.e., $t insert end "text" => $t insert end "text1" tag1 "text2" tag2 ...); results => output size reduced about 25%, time reduced about 12-15%
25 Mar	back to old mark command for Tk module
8 May	hyphens in SEE ALSO section would confuse link-finder, so re-linebreak if necessary(!) (Greg Earle & Uri Guttman)

13 Nov	Macintosh port by Matthias Neeracher <neeri@iis.ee.ethz.ch>
18 Dec	adapted to LaTeX2e, null manRef yields italicized man ref (H. Palme)
28	allow long option names (Larry Schwimmer)


1996
22 Jan	fixed problem with hyphenation supression and tabs in man page--sheesh! (H. Palme)
