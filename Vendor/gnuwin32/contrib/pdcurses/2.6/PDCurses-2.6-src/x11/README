              Welcome to PDCurses for X11 (aka XCurses)

 This is a port of PDCurses for X11.  It is designed to allow existing
 curses programs to be re-compiled with PDCurses resulting in native
 X11 programs.

 To be Done
 ----------

 - add newterm() function and have it create a new X window

 - provide a command line parsing function to enable X command line
   arguments to be parsed and stripped from the arguments passed back
   to the calling procedure.

 - add proper 'flash' behaviour

Structure
---------

x11.c           - contains functions that are X11 specific functions that are
                  used by both the process and thread implementations
x11.h           - #defines and includes for the X11 process/thread
x11_proc.c      - contains functions that are used by the X11 (child) process
                  in the process implementation
curses_proc.c   - contains functions that are used by the curses (parent)
                  process in the process implementation
x11_thread.c    -
curses_thread.c -
