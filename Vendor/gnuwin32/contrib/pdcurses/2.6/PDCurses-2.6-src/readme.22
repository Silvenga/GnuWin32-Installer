                             PDCurses 2.2
            (Public Domain Curses for DOS, OS/2 and Xwindows)


INTRODUCTION:

	This release of PDCurses has includes a number of major changes:
		- the portable library functions are now grouped together into
		  single files with the same arrangement as System V R4 curses.
		- a panels library has been included. This panels library was
		  written by Warren Tucker.
		- quite a few more functions have been supplied by Wade Schauer
		  and incorporated into release 2.2. Wade also supplied the
		  support for the Microway NDP C/C++ 32 bit DOS compiler.
		- the curses datatype has been changed from an unsigned in to
		  a long. This allows more attributes to be stored as well as
		  increasing the number of color-pairs from 32 to 64.

BUGS FIXED:

	mvwin() checked the wrong coordinates
	removed DESQview shadow memory buffer checking
	bug in curses.h in #define for wstandout()
	lots of others I can't remember

NEW FUNCTIONS:

	Too many to mention. See intro.man for a complete list of the
	functions PDCurses now supports.

COMPILER SUPPORT:

	DJGPP 1.12 is now supported. The run-time error that caused
	programs to crash has been removed.

	emx 0.9a is supported. A program compiled for OS/2 should also
	work under DOS if you use the VID=EMX switch when compiling. See
	the makefile for details.

	The Microway NDP C/C++ DOS compiler is now supported. Thanks to 
	Wade Schauer for this port.

	The Watcom C++ 10.0 DOS compiler is now supported. Thanks to
	Pieter Kunst for this port.

	The library now has many functions grouped together to reduce the
	size of the library and to improve the speed of compilation.

	The "names" of a couple of the compilers in the makefile has 
	changed; CSET2 is now ICC and GO32 is now GCC.

	The Xwindows port is experimental at the moment.

EXTRA OPTIONS:

	One difference between the behaviour of PDCurses and Unix curses
	is the attributes that are displayed when a character is cleared.
	Under Unix curses, no attributes are displayed, so 
	the result is always black. Under PDCurses, these functions clear
	with the current attributes in effect at the time. With the
	introduction of the bkgd functions, by default, PDCurses clears
	using the value set by (w)bkgd(). To have PDCurses behave the
	same way as it did before release 2.2, compile with -DPDCURSES_WCLR

ACKNOWLEGEMENTS: (for this release)

	Pieter Kunst,David Nugent,Warren Tucker,Darin Haugen,Stefan Strack,
	Wade Schauer and others who either allerted me to bugs or supplied
	fixes.


Cheers, Mark
