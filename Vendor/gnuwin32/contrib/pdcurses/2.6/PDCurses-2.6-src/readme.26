INTRODUCTION:

This release of PDCurses includes the following changes:

BUGS FIXED:

- Allow "special" characters like Ctrl-S, Ctrl-Q under OS/2 to be returned.
- Some bugs with halfdelay() principally on DOS fixed by William McBrine.

- Don't include "special" characters like KEY_SHIFT_L to be returned in getnstr()
  family.

  Also beep() called when buffer exceeded. Bug 562041.
- Reverse video of X11 selection reinstated. Pablo Garcia Abio??
- Right Alt modifier now works like left Alt modifier under Win32
- Add support for all libXaw replacement libraries with Scrollbar bug. Note

  libraries to fix the bug :-(

  by Frank Heckenbach.

  currently running process.
- new X11 resource; textCursor, allows the text cursor to be specified as a vertical
  bar, or in the standard horizontal bar. Thanks to Frank Heckenbach for the
  suggestion.
