1.3.2
  cygicons: a new DLL that provides cygwin-related icons
            original images were obtained from various (free
            as in speech) sources.
  Now installs documentation into $(prefix)/share/doc/cygutils
  Also installs per-component documentation in $(docdir)/component/
  No longer link apps to libpopt if they don't need it.
  Needs libtool for building cygicons, but side effect is to use
    libtool throughout.  cygicons requires libtool to be configured
    with RC support (e.g. windres). This may break building on 
    non-w32 platforms.

1.3.1

  build machinery updated to latest autotools -- now passes distcheck

1.2.6
  Remove readlink (now provided by coreutils-5.3.0+)
  conv/d2u/u2d:  add --force/--safe options (defaults to safe).
     Identify binary files by presence of '\0' and bail if --safe.
     Do not short circuit if first line ends in target style; keep
     going.  Collapse sequences of '\r' without '\n' to a single
     EOL of target style.  '--force' propagates '\0' from input to
     output.

    mkshortcut
