Provenance, licensing, and resolution, Oh My!

Windows icons come in many flavors: size, number 
of colors, transparency mechanism, etc.

The format of a single .ico image:
----------------------------------
Each image contains (among other things)
  o an indication of its size in pixels
  o an indication of the bit depth: 1,4,8,24,32
  o [optional]: a palette, containing
    * N entries, where N = 2 ^ bitdepth
    * each entry contains a 32bit record, consisting
      of an 8bit R, G, B triple and a reserve byte
      (no, it's not used for alpha)
  o an "AND" mask containing (most of) the pixel
    data.  This is an MxM raster (LL->LR, ... UL->UR)
    of pixels, where each pixel is represented by 
    1, 4, 8, 24, or 32 bits.  If 4 or 8, then the
    values represent indices into the palette. If
    1, the values represent black/white.  If 24,
    the values represent 24bit RGB data.  If 32,
    the values represent 24bit RGB data + 8bit alpha.
  o [optional]: an "XOR" maks containing (more) pixel
    data.  This is an MxM raster (LL->LR, ... UL->UR)
    of pixels, where each pixel is represent by
    1 bit.  This is used to create transparency (and
    other effects) for 1, 4, 8, and 24 bit icons.
    32bit icons have a built-in alpha channel in the
    "AND" mask, which provides all the transparency 
    effects it needs.    

One-bit transparency:
---------------------
Applies to 1,4,8, and 24 bit icon images.

As mentioned above, each icon image actually contains two
MxM pixel data arrays.  The first is called the "AND mask"
and uses N bits per pixel (where N is 1,4,8,24,or 32, although
32 bit icons use a different mechanism for transparency). The
second data array is called the "XOR mask" and is one bit per
pixel.

The XOR mask allows a few fancy effects: transparency, but
also "inverting" the background.  For transparency to work,
you have to choose one of your 16 (or 256, or 16M) colors 
as the "transparent" color, and then make sure the XOR mask 
has 1's everywhere the transparent color is used in the AND
mask, and 0's everywhere else. 
   For all the nitty-gritty, see
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/archive/default.asp?url=/archive/en-us/dnargdi/html/msdn_transblt.asp
By setting up places in the image where the XOR mask has 1's,
but the transparent color is not used in the AND mask at that
location, you get color-inversion at those locations.

Most icon editors simplify this process: you don't deal with
the XOR mask directly. Instead, you pick a color to be the
"transparent" one, and the editor figures out how to construct
the XOR mask from that.  (Thus, color-inversion effects are
hard to achieve with most icon editors).

The point is this: you get N colors (where N=2 ^ bitdepth, so
16 for 4bit, 256 for 8bit, 16M for 24bit) and NO transparency,
or you get N-1 colors and transparency.

Main icon format types:
-----------------------
   16 color: icons which contain only 16 colors
             chosen from a specific palette (not
             just ANY 16 colors).  This palette
             is the EGA 16:
                    0   0    0   black
                  128   0    0   dark red
                    0 128    0   dark green
                  128 128    0   brown
                    0   0  128   dark blue
                  128   0  128   purple
                    0 128  128   teal
                  128 128  128   grey
                  192 192  192   light grey
                  255   0    0   red
                    0 255    0   green
                  255 255    0   yellow
                    0   0  255   blue
                  255   0  255   magenta
                    0 255  255   cyan
                  255 255  255   white

             Additionally, one of these 16 colors
             can be designated the "transparent"
             color, given 15 "real" colors and
             1-bit transparency.

             "1-bit" transparency means no alpha,
             and no anti-aliasing.

   256color: icons which contain only 256 colors
             the palette can specify 256 unique
             colors chosen from the universe of
             16M 24bit RGB values.  Many 256color
             icons use a standard palette (the
             so-called web-safe 216, plus 40 others
             chosen somehow).

             Again, one of these 256 colors can be
             designated the "transparent" color. 
             Windows XP style guidelines say that
             magenta (#ff00ff) should be used for
             this.

             "1-bit" transparency means no alpha,
             and no anti-aliasing.

   24bit   : 16M colors, but you have to give up
             one of them if you want transparency.
             No alpha, no anti-aliasing.

   32bit   : 16M colors, with full 8bit alpha
             support and anti-aliasing.

Main icon sizes:
----------------
   16x16    : used on the TaskBar
   24x24    : uncommon. used on the left half of
              the Start Menu in Windows XP.
   32x32    : default icon size for desktop icons
   48x48    : DisplayProperties->Appearance->Advanced,
              Item=Icon, set size.  Not often used.
   256x256  : New icon size for Vista. Stored in compressed
              PNG format within the .ico file; completely
              violates all the rules described above.
