s2latex is a Scribe to LaTeX converter.  It is expected to get about 90%
right the first time it is run and then additions of translation rules will
help get much more of the way along.  See the Makefile for more details.  It
was written by Van Jacobson of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.

To help prevent duplicated efforts, Van Jacobson has agreed to coordinate
accepting contributions of additional translation rules.  If you find
yourself writing a translation rule that you think is of general usefulness,
please send it to him---his net address is van@lbl-csam.  Identifying
commonly needed translation rules will be of benefit as well since they can
be added to the default set provided by the program.
