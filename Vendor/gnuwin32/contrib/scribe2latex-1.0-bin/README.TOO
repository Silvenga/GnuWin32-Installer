This is what I have been able to assemble of what was apparently a
full distribution of s2latex, a converter for turning Scribe text into
LaTeX-compatible files.  I have been unable to test the converter (we
don't have Scribe here), and the files that I received were evidently
incomplete.  The original author (Van Jacobson) is unreachable by
E-mail.

The most glaring lacuna was the fact that the file s2l.y did not end
in a newline.  Its last line looked like this:

#include "lex.yy.c<end of file>

I have appended a double quote and a newline to this file; that way,
the thing at least compiles and links.  Nonetheless, one has to
suspect that other stuff might be missing as well, and since I can't
test the executable, I can give no guarantee.

When you do a make, you will get a yacc message about 81 shift/reduce
and 48 reduce/reduce conflicts.  According to the comments in the file
s2l.y, this can be ignored.

If you get the s2latex program to work, please let me know; also tell
me whether you're satisfied with it.  In particular, if you make
changes to the sources to get it to work, please pass them on to me,
in case someone else should ask for the program.
