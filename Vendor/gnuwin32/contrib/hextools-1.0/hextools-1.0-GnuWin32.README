* HexTools-1.0 for Windows *
============================

What is it?
-----------
HexTools: reversible hexdump

Description
-----------
reversible hexdump is a hexdump/hex2bin-toolkit that dumps to a special
readable and reversible hexadecimal byte-dump, where you can not only
change bytes, but also insert or delete bytes. It has a flush-switch,
where it will output hexbytes for each single char it reads. This is
especially useful (imho) for watching output from slow devices (e.g.,
serial devices like mice). The hex2bin-utility (the reverse-hexdump)
not only accepts hexbytes for input, but also double-quoted strings
with most of the escape-chars known from C and makes good attempts at
undumping even hexdumps with repetition-lines (a "*" on its own line).
It's written in ANSI C.
