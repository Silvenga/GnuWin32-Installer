* Xpm2Wico-0.2.4.3 for Windows *
================================

What is it?
-----------
Xpm2Wico: convert X pixmap to Windows icon

Description
-----------
Xpm2Wico can create icons with 256 colors or more from Xpm files with any type
of colour scheme, both with hex- and literal colour encodings.
Support for multiple-icons file output will probably be added later.

Usage is pretty simple:

- create an .xpm file with the GIMP;
- convert it. The cmdline takes a minimum of one parameter which is the input
  icon. If the second parameter is omitted, the name of the ico file is deduced
  from the first one.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in xpm2wico-0.2.4.3-GnuWin32.diffs in xpm2wico-0.2.4.3-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
