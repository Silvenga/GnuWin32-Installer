xpm2wico
--------

I have written this program primarily to help free software programmers like
me to not depend on evil proprietary programs to write Windows icons.
It can create icons with 256 colors or more from Xpm files with any type
of colour scheme, both with hex- and literal colour encodings.
Support for multiple-icons file output will probably be added later.

Usage is pretty simple:
- create an .xpm file with the GIMP;
- convert it. The cmdline takes a minimum of one parameter which is the input
  icon. If the second parameter is omitted, the name of the ico file is deduced
  from the first one. 

General features:
- support for icons with any bpp (minimum output will be 8bpp though);
- support for transparency;
- support for symbolic colour names;
- cross-platform, as such it can serve as an example on how to build
  cross-platform, cross-compilable programs with the GNU programming
  tools: autoconf, automake, gcc;
- is coded in C;
- is bug-free;
- is distributed under the GNU GPL. And as such permits cross-platform
  application writers to not depend on evil proprietary programs.

A similar project, with support for bitmap icons, is available at

Please don't confuse the names.
