2002-10-05  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/xpm2wico.c (parse_args): don't launch the conversion if no
	filename was specified, display an error message instead.

2002-10-03  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/readicon.c: - we don't need to include endian.h

	* src/winutils.c: - we don't need to include endian.h

	* src/xpm2wico.c (copyright): updated copyright notice
	- we don't need to include endian.h
	- removed unused variables

2002-10-02  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* configure.in: the new rgb.txt parsing features merits its own
	version. Let there be xpm2wico 0.3.4.

	* src/rgbtxt.c: new file implementing rgb.txt parsing.
	seek_rgb_tab moved there.

2002-06-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/xpm2wico.c (seek_rgb_tab): new function to seek literal
	colours in rgbtab.h

	* src/winutils.c: added debugging features.

2001-07-27  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/xpm2wico.c (make_and_mask): applied patch from Carey Evans
	<carey@debian.org> to fix non-32-bit-aligned AND mask generation.

2001-03-13  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/xpm2wico.c (convert_color): better modularity of color
	conversion, each color scheme has its own converter, selected by a
	new function 'choose_converter'
	(choose_converter): select the right color converter following the
	values in the XpmColor structure;
	Added better feedback about what is going on.
	Added better copyright and usage infos.

2001-02-28  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/xpm2wico.c (convert_color): added grayscale and monochrome
	color scheme. Not complete, but I am waiting for further problems
	to occur because of lack of documentation.

2001-02-27  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/xpm2wico.c (save_icon): open output file with the b flag
	added. Even on GNU/Linux it seems to have an influence, causing
	the data to be somewhat aligned, which completely screw the icon,
	which causes us to seek a problem in our code which isn't during
	hours and days and nights.
	(help_and_version): added help, version and copyright
	informations for those who might think I would release a program
	under something else than the GPL.

	* src/readicon.c: experimental support for 16bpp icons;
	(read_bm_ih): Fixed a typo: bm_ih->biClrUsed really is a DWord and
	not a Word;

2001-02-26  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/xpm2wico.c: Replaced wintypes so that they don't clashes
	when compiled for Windows;
