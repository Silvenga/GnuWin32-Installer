PDFlib - A library for generating PDF on the fly
================================================

Portable C library for dynamically generating PDF ("Adobe Acrobat") files,
with support for many other programming languages.

The PDFlib distribution is available from http://www.pdflib.com

PDFlib is a library for generating PDF files. It offers an API with
support for text, vector graphics, raster image, and hypertext. Call PDFlib
routines from within your client program and voila: dynamic PDF files!

PDFlib is available on a wide variety of operating system platforms,
and supports many programming languages and development environments:

- C
- C++
- Cobol
- COM (Visual Basic, ASP, Windows Script Host, Delphi, and many others)
- Java via the JNI, including servlets and JSP (but not EJB)
- .NET framework (VB.NET, ASP.NET, C# and others).
- Perl
- PHP Hypertext Processor
- Python
- REALbasic
- RPG
- Tcl

An overview of PDFlib features can be found in the PDFlib reference manual
in the PDF file PDFlib-manual.pdf. A separate edition of the manual is
available for COM, .NET, and REALbasic.


PDFlib flavors
==============
The PDFlib software is available in different flavors (see the PDFlib
manual for a detailed comparison):

- PDFlib Lite
  Open-source edition for basic PDF generation, free for personal use.
  PDFlib Lite does not support all languages, and is not available on
  EBCDIC platforms.
  Important note: PDFlib Lite supports only a subset of PDFlib features.
  The differences are detailed in the PDFlib manual.

- PDFlib
  The commercial edition adds various features for advanced PDF generation.

- PDFlib+PDI
  Includes PDFlib plus the PDF Import library PDI which can be used to
  integrate pages from existing PDF documents in the generated output

- PDFlib Personalization Server (PPS)
  Includes PDFlib+PDI, plus advanced block processing functions for
  easily personalizing PDF documents. PPS also includes the Block
  plugin for Adobe Acrobat which can be used to create PDFlib blocks
  interactively. The Block plugin is distributed in a separate installer.



First Steps with a binary Package
=================================
PDFlib, PDFlib+PDI, and PPS are available in binary form, and require
a commercial license. All of these products are available in a single
library, and can be evaluated without any restrictions without any
license. However, unless a valid license key is applied a demo stamp
will be generated across all pages.
The binary packages support C plus various other language bindings.
Instructions for using these packages can be found in doc/readme-binary.txt.


First Steps with the PDFlib Lite Source Package
===============================================
PDFlib Lite is available in source form, and can be used for free under
certain conditions. Source code is also available for selected language
wrappers. If you are working with a source code package you need an ANSI C
compiler. Detailed instructions for building PDFlib from source code
can be found in doc/readme-source-*.txt


Quick Start and Documentation
=============================
For a jump-start, take a look at the PDFlib samples which are available
for all supported languages:

- The following examples work with all editions of PDFlib:
  The hello, pdfclock, and image samples generate PDF output with simple text,
  vector graphics, and images. The chartab examples contains a more advanced
  sample for using fonts and encodings in PDFlib. It can also be used to
  create handy character set reference tables.

- The invoice and quickreference examples require PDFlib+PDI, and demonstrate
  how to deal with existing PDF documents.

- The businesscard example requires the PDFlib Personalization Server (PPS),
  and contains a simple personalization example.

After reviewing these samples you should take a look at the main PDFlib
documentation: the "PDFlib Reference Manual" is included as PDF in all packages.
It is the definite reference for using PDFlib. The majority of questions
will be answered in this manual.
