What is it?
-----------
PDFLib-Lite: library for writing PDF files

Description
-----------
PDFlib is a development tool for PDF-enabling your software, or
generating PDF on your server. PDFlib saves you the intricate
details of PDF generation by offering a simple-to-use API for
programmatically creating PDF files from within your own server-
or client-side software. PDFlib doesn't make use of third-party
software for generating PDF, nor does it require any other tools.

The PDFlib software in this release is PDFlib Lite, an Open-source
edition for basic PDF generation, free for personal use.

in pdflib-lite-6.0.2-GnuWin32.diffs in pdflib-lite-6.0.2-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the

Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
