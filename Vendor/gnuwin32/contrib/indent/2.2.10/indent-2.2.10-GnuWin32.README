* Indent-2.2.10 for Windows *
=============================

What is it?
-----------
Indent: format C source code

Description
-----------
The indent program changes the appearance of a C program by inserting or deleting white-space. It can be used to make code easier to read. It can also convert from one style of writing C to another. Indent understands a substantial amount about the syntax of C, but it also attempts to cope with incomplete and misformed syntax. In version 1.2 and more recent versions, the GNU style of indenting is the default.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in indent-2.2.10-GnuWin32.diffs in indent-2.2.10-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
