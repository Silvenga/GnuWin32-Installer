README.VC++ for GNU `indent' 2.2.10
----------------------------------

This file contains instructions for compiling GNU indent on the Win32 platform, and, in particular, Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 (though it may compile happily on earlier releases, this has not been tested)

There are a couple of methods of compiling it - either from the command line or from within Visual C++ itself

Preparation steps
-----------------

1. As Win32 has no equivalent of the 'configure' shell script, it is necessary to manually create the config.h file yourself. This can be done by renaming 'config.vc++' to 'config.h'. These options are sufficient for VC++ 6. If you are having problems compiling on an earlier releases, this file may be the place to look and modify the #defines.

Compilation procedure
---------------------
For both methods first move the file miscel/indent.dsp to the src directory.

Option 1 - From within Visual C++

  1. Open the project file ('indent.dsp')
  2. Select a Debug or Release build
  3. Build.

  The final destination of indent.exe may be dependant on your configuration.

Option 2 - From the command line (Visual C++ 6.0 and later)

  1. Ensure your PATH is setup to correctly find the Visual C++ directories. 
     This can be achieved by running 

	x:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\VCVARS32.BAT

     (where x: is the drive VC++ is installed on)

  2. At the command prompt, and from the indent distribution directory, 
     run the following command:

	msdev indent.dsp /MAKE  "indent - Win32 Release"

Notes
-----

The 'indent.exe' compiled under Visual C++ 6.0 has been tested successfully on Windows 95, 98, NT 4 and 2000.
