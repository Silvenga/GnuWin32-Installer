Dear Folks,

this directory contains the shell-archive with the parseAFM-package by
Adobe Systems Inc. The shell archive is only located here for
completeness. The files used by the t1-library (parseAFM.c,
parseAFM.h) have been extracted and copied to the t1lib-subdirectory.
Thus, no make is done in this directory.
