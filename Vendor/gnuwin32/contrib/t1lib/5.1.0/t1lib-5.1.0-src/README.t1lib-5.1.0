About t1lib:
------------

t1lib is a library distributed under the GNU General Public Library
License for generating character- and string-glyphs from Adobe Type 1
fonts under UNIX. t1lib uses most of the code of the X11 rasterizer
donated by IBM to the X11-project. But some disadvantages of the
rasterizer being included in X11 have been eliminated. Here are some
of the features:

- t1lib is completely independent of X11 (although the program
  provided for testing the library needs X11)

- fonts are made known to library by means of a font database file at
  runtime 

- searchpaths for all types of input files are configured by means
  of a configuration file at runtime 

- characters are rastered as they are needed

- characters and complete strings may be rastered by a simple function
  call

- when rastering strings, pairwise kerning information from .afm-files
  may optionally be taken into account

- an interface to ligature-information of afm-files is provided

- a program to generate afm-files from Type 1 font files is included

- rotation and arbitrary transformations are supported

- there's support for extending and slanting fonts

- underlining, overlining and overstriking is supported

- new encoding vectors may be loaded at runtime and fonts may be
  reencoded using these encoding vectors 

- antialiasing is implemented 

- Right-To-Left typesetting is supported

- Font subsetting is easily possible

- support of composite character information

- stroking of character outlines with variable strokewidths 

- An interactive test program called "xglyph" is included in the
  distribution. This program allows to test all of the features of the
  library. It requires X11.



Changes and New Features:
-------------------------

- See the file Changes in the T1Lib top-directory for information on new
  features. 



Installation:
-------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: VMS-users should examine configure.com in the toplevel directory, which
      is a configure-script for VMS, kindly contributed by John Hasstedt
      and now maintained by Martin Zinser.
      This file contains notes on how to compile t1lib on VMS.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


After unpacking the archive (what you obviously did already), change
to subdirectory t1lib-..../  and type:

   ./configure

This will create the Makefiles. Then type

   make


In order to use the testprogram xglyph, X11 needs to be installed on your
system. 

If you have difficulties during configuring and building t1lib, cd to
directory t1lib-.../doc and execute

   $ latex t1lib_doc.tex
   $ makeindex t1lib_doc
   $ latex t1lib_doc.tex
   $ latex t1lib_doc.tex

This will generate the docs which contain a more detailed description 
of the build-process. LaTeX2e is required. Alternatively, you can scan the
preformatted pdf-documentation.


Before installing the libraries, you should test whether all things 
work correct:
     
1) Change to subdirectory xglyph

2) Start the program xglyph

3) Ensure that the output-window is not hidden behind another window.

4) Before doing anything other, click on button "String". The
   string "Test" should now be rastered and displayed in the
   output-window, using font BitstreamCharterBTRoman at 100bp without
   kerning. If that works, most probably all works for you.

5) Have a look at t1lib_doc.dvi in the doc-subdirectory of the package 
   and read the chapter on xglyph. However, most of this program is
   self-explaining, so that you might want to omit this step.

6) Play with the program and enjoy.

7) If you do not have X11, you can still check whether t1lib works for
   you. Copy one of the pfb-files from t1lib-.../Fonts/type1, say,
   bchr.pfb, to the type1afm-subdirectory, and run 

     type1afm bchr.pfb

   If the afm-file bchr.afm is generated, t1lib will most probably
   work on your system.



Documentation:
--------------

As mentioned above, documentation is provided in LaTeX2e-format
subdirectory T1Lib/doc. It should have been built during the build.
The section on runtime setup is really important,
because programs may fail due to an invalid or incomplete runtime
setup, although the programs itself may be correct!
A preformatted Version is also available in pdf.



How to get it:
--------------

t1lib is available at

ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/t1lib-x.y[.z].tar.gz

where x.y[.z] is the version identification.



Closing:
--------

You are allowed to send the author lots of money and dozents of gifts,
but you needn't :-) 
If you have any comments to this library, feedback is wanted. Send
eMail to: 

Rainer.Menzner@web.de



Future:
-------

Within the past years, my time has constantly and increasingly become spare so
that I hardly found time to further develop t1lib. And developing free
software is undoubtedly related to a certain amount of fun, which in turn only
can come up if you are relaxed with respect to time ...

Since t1lib now has reached a reasonably stable state, I intend to more or
less freeze the development of new features at this point. Of course, bug
fixes etc. should be possible further.

If there is somebody out there willing to further develop t1lib, he or she is
welcome to contact me ...



Have fun,

  -Rainer
