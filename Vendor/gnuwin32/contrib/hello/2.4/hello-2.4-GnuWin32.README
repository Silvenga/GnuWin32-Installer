* Hello-2.4 for Windows *
=========================

What is it?
-----------
Hello: GNU greeting program

Description
-----------
Writing a program that prints "Hello, world!" is the classic beginner's programming task. The GNU version takes this a step further by processing its argument list to modify its behavior, by supporting internationalization, and by including a mail reader. The primary purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to write other programs that do these things; it serves as a model for all of the GNU coding standards.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in hello-2.4-GnuWin32.diffs in hello-2.4-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
