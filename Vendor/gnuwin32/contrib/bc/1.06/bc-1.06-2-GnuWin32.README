=======================

What is it?
-----------
Bc: arbitrary precision calculator language

Description
-----------
bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language. Syntax
is similar to C, but differs in many substantial areas. It
supports interactive execution of statements. bc is a language
that supports arbitrary precision numbers with interactive
execution of statements. There are some similarities in the
syntax to the C programming language. A standard math library
is available by command line option. If requested, the math
library is defined before processing any files. bc starts by
processing code from all the files listed on the command line
in the order listed. After all files have been processed, bc
reads from the standard input. All code is executed as it is
read. (If a file contains a command to halt the processor, bc
will never read from the standard input.)

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in bc-1.06-2-GnuWin32.diffs in bc-1.06-2-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
