NAME
       intro - introduction to games and demos

DESCRIPTION
       The  manual  pages  with  the  section  6 suffix are for
       recreational and educational programs normally found  in
       the directory /usr/games; however, Silicon Graphics cur-
       rently does not ship any such programs, so  this  direc-
       tory  does  not exist.  The manual pages with the suffix
       6D are the demonstration programs found in the directory
       /usr/demos/General_Demos,        /usr/demos/O2        or
       /usr/demos/OCTANE Beginning  with  the  6.3  release  of
       IRIX,  these  demos  can be accessed from several mecha-
       nisms: -  from  a  web-based  interface,  which  can  be
       started  using  the  toolchest Find; Demos menu option -
       from the system iconcatalog, which can be started  using
       the  toolchest Find; Iconcatalog; Demos - from buttonfly
       (/usr/demos/buttonfly) - and directly from the  directo-
       ries    /usr/demos/General_Demos,    /usr/demos/O2   and
       /usr/demos/OCTANE Both buttonfly and the directory noted
       above  can  be  accessed  using the Find; File QuickFind
       menu option or  Selected;  File  QuickFind  menu  option
       available  from the system toolchest The availability of
       these programs and the data they use will vary from sys-
       tem to system and from release to release.

       The  following error message (or something similiar) may
       appear when exiting out of the  demos  improperly:  XIO:

       cessed) with 0 events remaining.  Ignore this error mes-
       sage. The system has not been affected in any way.   The
       proper  way  to  exit out of demos is by : 1) typing the
       ESC key or 2) clicking on the  right  mouse  button  and
