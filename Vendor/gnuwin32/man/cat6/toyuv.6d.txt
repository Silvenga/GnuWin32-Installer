       toyuv inimage.rgb outimage.yuv

DESCRIPTION
       toyuv  converts an IRIS image to yuv format so it can be
       sent to an Abekas digital video frame store.  This  pro-
       gram  normally  expects an IRIS image that is 720 by 486
       pixels. This image should have non-square pixels. If you
       want  to  use  square pixels, provide toyuv with an IRIS
       image that is 640 by 486 pixels and use the "-s" option.
