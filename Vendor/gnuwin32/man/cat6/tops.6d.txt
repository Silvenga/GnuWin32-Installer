DESCRIPTION
       tops  converts  an IRIS image file into Postscript. This
       program can generate black  and  white  or  color  Post-
       Script.  It  can  create  binary  as well as ASCII Post-
       Script. It also  can  generate  encapsulated  PostScript
       with  a  preview  image.   The -l specifies the halftone
       screen density to use in the output image.  The  default
       is  a  40 line per inch screen.  The -a option specifies
       the screen angle to  use  in  the  printed  image.   The
       default  is a 45 degree screen.  The -p option specifies
       how many pixels per inch  the  image  printed  at.   For
       instance, the IRIS screen pixel density is 98 pixels per
       inch. If you want to print  a  part  of  the  screen  at
       actual  size  use  an  option  -p  98.0.   The -x and -y
       options let you specify the  x  and  y  pixel  densities
       independently.  The -b option specifies how many bits to
       use when describing images. The valid options are 1,  2,
       4,  and  8.  The  default is 8 bits per pixel giving 256
       shades in a black and white image.  If the -B option  is
       given,  binary  PostScript  for  the image is generated.
       This makes the output file about half as  big,  but  you
       should only use this option if you know that the printer
       you are using can handle binary PostScript data.  The -t
       option  allows you to give a value that is used to scale
       the x and y pixel densities  given  above.  Values  less
       than  1.0  will  print  a smaller image.  Normally, tops
       scales the image to fit a 8.5 by 11.0 inch page. The  -m
       option  option  lets you describe how large the page is.
       Normally, tops uses a standard dot screen. The -h option
       generates  PostScript  that  uses a line screen instead.
       The -o option allows you to specify an  origin  for  the
       image.   Normally,  tops generates black and white Post-
       Script. If the -rgb or the -RGB option  is  given,  then
       rgb color PostScript will be generated. The only differ-
       ence between these two options is whether 1 function  is
       used  to  read  the image data, or 3 functions are used.
       If the -cmyk or the -CMYK option  is  given,  then  cmyk
       color  PostScript will be generated. The only difference
       between these two options is whether 1 function is  used
       to  read  the  image data, or 4 functions are used.  The
       -eps option will cause  Encapsulated  PostScript  to  be
       generated,  with a preview bitmap. This option should be
       used if you want to include the PostScript  in  a  docu-
       ment.  The -I option will generate an Encapsulated Post-
       Script image with a preview bitmap, but only a low reso-
       lution  version  of  the input image is saved. This file
       can then be included into a document for position  only.
       Later the low resolution image can be replaced with high
       resolution image data.
