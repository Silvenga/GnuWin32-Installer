       The red hash-marks indicate the boundaries of the  range
       of  intensities for a given image. The black line start-
       ing in the bottom left corner and going up  to  the  top
       right  is  the indicator of the distribution function of
       the histogram.  Pressing LEFTMOUSE will print the  pixel
       value currently under the cursor.
