NAME
       fromdi  -  convert an old .di dithered image into an RGB
       image

SYNOPSIS
       fromdi colors.map outimage.rgb

DESCRIPTION
       fromdi converts an old .di dithered (8-bits) image  into
       an  RGB  image.  ipaste works differently on 4D machines
       than it originally did on 2000/3000 IRIS machines. While
       it  is  true  that on the 2000/3000 machines image files
       made by the program dither (making an 8-bit image) would
       work  with  ipaste  ,  on the 4D's ipaste was written to
       operate on RGB (24-bit) images or SCREEN (16-bit  start-
       ing at zero) images but not with DITHERED (8-bits start-
       ing at some offset) images. Refer to  the  Note  in  the
       ipaste(1G)  man page stating that if one REALLY wants to
       view their DITHERED images on a 4D, they will first need
       to  use  fromdi  to  convert them from DITHERED into RGB
       format, and then can use ipaste to display them.
