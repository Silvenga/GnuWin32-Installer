NAME
       scrsave - save a part of the screen in an image file

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/scrsave outimage.rgb [x1 x2 y1 y2] -b

DESCRIPTION
       scrsave saves a portion of the screen into either an RGB
       or a Black and White image file. scrsave with  no  other
       arguments  than  the  output filename will save the con-
       tents of the entire screen to an  IRIS  image  file.  By
       giving  additional  arguments  a  smaller  region of the
       screen can be saved. scrsave dump.rgb 0 99 0 99 saves  a
       100  pixel  by  100  pixel square in the lower left hand
       corner of the screen.  When invoked, the -b option  will
       save  the  screen  data as a Black and White (1 byte per
       pixel deep) image rather than as an  RGB  (3  bytes  per
       pixel deep) image.
