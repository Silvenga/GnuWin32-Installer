.SH NAME
ntfsfix \- tool for fixing NTFS partitions altered by the Linux kernel NTFS driver.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ntfsfix
.I device
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B ntfsfix
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBntfsfix\fP is a program that fixes NTFS partitions altered in any
manner with the Linux NTFS driver. \fBntfsfix\fP is \fBNOT\fP a Linux
version of chkdsk. It only tries to leave the NTFS partition in a
not-so-inconsistent state after the NTFS driver has written to it.
.sp
\fBntfsfix\fP appeared because MS chkdsk is well known for its
stupidity when fixing altered partitions. Because the main problems
are journal files, \fBntfsfix\fP aims to fix those issues.
.sp
Running ntfsfix after mounting NTFS partitions read-write is recommended
for reducing the chance of severe data loss when NT/W2K/XP tries to remount
the affected partition(s).
.sp
In order to use \fBntfsfix\fP you must unmount the NTFS partition, and run
ntfsfix device, where device is the NTFS partition. After this, you can
safely reboot into NT/W2K/XP. Please note that \fBntfsfix\fP is not a
chkdsk-like tool, and so is not guaranteed that it could fix all the
alterations provoked by the NTFS driver.
