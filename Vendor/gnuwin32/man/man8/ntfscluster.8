.SH NAME
ntfscluster \- identify files in a specified region of an NTFS volume.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ntfscluster
[
.I options
]
.B device
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ntfscluster
has three modes of operation:
.IR info ,
.I sector
and
.IR cluster .
.SS Info
.PP
The default mode,
.I info
is currently not implemented.  It will display general infomation about the NTFS
volume when it is working.
.SS Sector
.PP
The
.I sector
mode will display a list of files that have data in the specified range of
sectors.
.SS Cluster
The
.I cluster
mode will display a list of files that have data in the specified range of
clusters.  When the cluster size is one sector, this will be equivalent to the
.I sector
mode of operation.
.SH OPTIONS
Below is a summary of all the options that
.B ntfscluster
accepts.  All options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by
.BR \-
and the long name is preceded by
.BR \-\- .
Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a
single command, e.g.
.BR \-fv
is equivalent to
.BR "\-f \-v" .
Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
.TP
.BI "\-c " range
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI "\-\-cluster " range
Any files whose data is in this range of clusters will be displayed.
.TP
.B \-f
.br
.ns
.TP
.B \-\-force
This will override some sensible defaults, such as not working with a mounted
volume.  Use this option with caution.
