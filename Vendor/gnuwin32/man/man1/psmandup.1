.PP
Produced output is meant for PS level 2 printers which don't support
Duplex printing, but support Manual Feed.  Once the first set of pages
is printed (odd pages), manual feed is asked: introduce the odd pages
to print the even pages on the other side.
.PP
Because there is usually a short time out for manually fed jobs, you
should really be next to the printer.  If ever the time out expired,
use the option \fB\-b\fR to send only the missing part.
.PP
Environment variables FIXPS, PSSELECT and PSSET, if defined, are used
to find the tools.
