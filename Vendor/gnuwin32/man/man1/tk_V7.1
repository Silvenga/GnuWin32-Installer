.SH DESCRIPTION
The output of
.I tk
is intended for a Tektronix 4014 terminal.
.I Tk
arranges for 66 lines to fit on the screen,
divides the screen into
.I N
columns,
and
contributes an eight space page offset
in the (default) single-column case.
Tabs, spaces, and backspaces are collected and plotted
when necessary.
Teletype Model 37 half- and reverse-line sequences
are interpreted and plotted.
At the end of each page
.I tk
waits for a newline (empty line) from the keyboard before
continuing on to the next page.
In this wait state, the command
.BI ! command
will send the
.I command
to the shell.
.PP
The command line options are:
.TP
.B \-t
Don't wait between pages; for directing output into a file.

.TP
.BI \- N
Divide the screen into \fIN\fR columns and
wait after the last column.

lines.
