.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmtox10bm\fP

[\fIpbmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpbmtox10bm\fP reads a PBM image as input and produces an X10
bitmap as output.  This older format is
obsoleted by the X11 bitmap format.
.PP
Note that there is no x10bmtopbm tool, because \fIxbmtopbm\fP can
read both X11 and X10 bitmaps.
