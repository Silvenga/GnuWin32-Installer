.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBwinicontoppm\fP reads a Microsoft Windows .ico file and
converts it to one or more PPMs.
.PP
A Windows icon contains one or more images, at different resolutions
and color depths.  Each image has an 'and' mask, which contains transparancy
data. 
.PP
By default, the output goes to Standard Output.  If you specify
\fIppmdestfile\fP, output goes into one or more files named as
follows.  If it's just one file (i.e. you specify the \fB-multippm\fP
option or don't specify \fB-allicons\fP), the file name is
\fIppmdestfile\fP\fB.ppm\fP.  If it's multiple files, their file
names are \fIppmdestfile\fP\fB_1.ppm\fP,
\fIppmdestfile\fP\fB_2.ppm\fP, etc.  
.PP
 When you specify the
\fB-writeands\fP option, the file names above are modified to include
the string \fBxor\fP as in \fIppmdestfile\fP\fB_xor.ppm\fP or
\fIppmdestfile\fP\fB_xor_1.ppm\fP.
.PP
\fBwinicontoppm\fP can convert .ico images with 1, 4, 8, 24, or
32 bits per pixel.  Before Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003), it could not handle
24 and 32.
