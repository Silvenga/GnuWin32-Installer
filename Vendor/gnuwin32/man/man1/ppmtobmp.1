.SH NAME

ppmtobmp - convert a PPM image into a BMP file

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmtobmp\fP

[\fB-windows\fP]

[\fB-os2\fP]

[\fB-bpp=\fP\fIbits_per_pixel\fP]

[\fIppmfile\fP]
.PP
Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use white
space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from its value.


.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmtobmp\fP reads a PPM image as input and produces a Microsoft
Windows or OS/2 BMP file as output.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-windows\fP
Tells the program to produce a Microsoft Windows BMP file.  (This
is the default.)

.TP
\fB-os2\fP
Tells the program to produce an OS/2 BMP file.  (Before August
2000, this was the default).

.TP
\fB-bpp\fP
This tells how many bits per pixel you want the BMP file to
contain.  Only 1, 4, 8, and 24 are possible.  By default,
\fBppmtobmp\fP chooses the smallest number with which it can
represent all the colors in the input image.  If you specify a number
too small to represent all the colors in the input image,
\fBppmtobmp\fP tells you and terminates.  You can use \fBpnmquant\fP
or \fBppmdither\fP to reduce the number of colors in the image.




.UN lbAF
.SH NOTES
.PP
To get a faithful reproduction of the input image, the maxval of the
input image must be 255.  If it is something else, 
the colors in the BMP file may be slightly different from the colors
in the input.
.PP
Windows icons are not BMP files.  Use \fBppmtowinicon\fP to
create those.
