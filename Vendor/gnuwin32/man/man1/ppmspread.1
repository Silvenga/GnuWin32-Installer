.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmspread\fP reads a PPM image as input and moves every pixel
around a bit relative to its original position. \fIamount\fP
determines by how many pixels a pixel is to be moved around at most.
.PP
Pictures processed with this filter will seem to be somewhat
dissolved or unfocussed (although they appear more coarse than images
processed by something like \fIpnmconvol\fP).
