.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fByuvsplittoppm\fP reads three files, containing the YUV
components, as input.  These files are \fIbasename\fP.Y,
\fIbasename\fP.U, and \fIbasename\fP.V.  Produces a portable pixmap
on stdout.
.PP
Since the YUV files are raw files, the dimensions \fIwidth\fP and
\fIheight\fP must be specified on the command line.
