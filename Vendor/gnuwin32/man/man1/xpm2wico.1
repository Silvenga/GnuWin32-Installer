.SH NAME
xpm2wico \- a free program which converts .xpm files to Windows .ico files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xpm2wico
.I "[options] infile [outfile]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B xpm2wico
is a program that converts X Pixmaps (.xpm) files to Windows .ico files.
.sp
I have written this program primarily to help free software programmers like
me to not depend on evil proprietary programs to write Windows icons.
.sp
It can create icons with 256 colors or more from Xpm files with any type
of colour scheme, both with hex- and literal colour encodings.
Support for multiple-icons file output will probably be added later.
.sp
Note that
.B xpm2wico
does not scale images (yet) and the Windows standard ICO format only
allows dimensions of 16x16, 32x32 or 64x64.
.SH OPTIONS
The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
