.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpcxtoppm\fP reads a PCX file as input and produces a PPM image
as output.
.PP
\fBpcxtoppm\fP recognizes the following PCX types:


.IP \(bu
Colormapped files with 2-16 colors.
.sp
\&'Packed pixel' format (1, 2 or 4 bits/pixel, 1 plane) or
bitplane format (1 bit/pixel, 1-4 planes).  The program uses a
predefined standard palette if the image does not provide one.
\&'Does not provide one' means the palette in the PCX header is
completely black.

.IP \(bu
Colormapped files with 256 colors.
.sp
8 bits/pixel, 1 plane, colormap at the end of the file.

.IP \(bu
24bit truecolor files.
.sp
24bit RGB: 8 bits/pixel, 3 planes.

.IP \(bu
32bit truecolor files.
.sp
24bit RGB + 8bit intensity: 8 bits/pixel, 4 planes.



.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-stdpalette\fP
This option causes \fBpcxtoppm\fP to use its predefined standard 
palette even if the PCX image provides its own.  This is meaningful only
for an image in the 16 color paletted PCX format.
.sp
The image may appear to provide its own palette but in fact be created
by a program too primitive to understand palettes that created a random
palette by accident.
