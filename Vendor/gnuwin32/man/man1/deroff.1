.SH DESCRIPTION \"{{{
.B deroff
reads roff documents and removes all
.IR nroff (1),
.IR troff (1),
.IR refer (1),
.IR tbl (1),
.IR eqn (1)
and
.IR pic (1)
constructs.  The resulting text will be sent to standard output.
\&\fB.so\fP and \fB.nx\fP requests are processed, but repeated requests
to process an already read file will be ignored.
.\"}}}
.SH OPTIONS \"{{{
.IP "\fB\-w\fP, \fB\-\-word-list\fP"
Output a word list, one word per line.
.IP "\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-skip-headers\fP"
Do not output headers.  This is useful if you want to run text analysis
tools on the output.
.IP "\fB\-ml\fP, \fB\-\-suppress-lists\fP"
Suppress lists.  This option is useful with \fB\-s\fP, if
there are many incomplete sentences in lists.
.IP "\fB\-ms\fP, \fB\-mm\fP"
These options are accepted for compatibility, but they are being ignored.
.IP "\fB\-i\fP"
Ignore \fB.so\fP and \fB.nx\fP requests.
.IP "\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-pretty\-print\fP"
Format the output more pretty by omitting and adding newline characters
at certain places.
.IP "\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP"
Print a short usage message.
.IP \fB\-\-version\fP
Print the version.
.\"}}}
.SH EXAMPLE \"{{{
The following example does a simple spell check of a document:
.sp
deroff -w document.mm | sort -u |
.br
comm -23 - /usr/share/words/en
.\"}}}
.SH RESTRICTIONS \"{{{
.B deroff
is not a complete roff parser, so it can be confused by complicated
constructs.  Often too much output is done in these cases.
