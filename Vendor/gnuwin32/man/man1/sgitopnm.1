.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBsgitopnm\fP reads an SGI image file as input and produces a PGM
image for a 2-dimensional (1 channel) input file, and a PPM image for
a 3-dimensional (3 or more channels) input file.
.PP
Alternatively, the program produces a PGM image of any one of the
channels in the input file.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Give some information about the SGI image file.

.TP
\fB-channel\fP \fIc\fP
Extract channel \fIc\fP of the image as a PGM image.  Without
this option, \fBsgitopnm\fP extracts the first 3 channels as a PPM
image or, if the input has only 1 channel, extracts that as a PGM
image, and if the input has 2 channels, fails.
