.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBrasttopnm\fP reads a Sun rasterfile as input and produces a PNM
image as output.  The type of the output file depends on the input
file - if it's black and white, \fBrasttopnm\fP writes a PBM image.
If it's grayscale, \fBrasttopnm\fP writes a PGM.  If it's color,
\fBrasttopnm\fP writes a PPM.  The program tells you which type it is
generating.
