.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpnmcut\fP was obsoleted by
.BR \fBpamcut\fP (1), introduced with Netpbm 9.20 (May
2001).  \fBpamcut\fP is backward compatible with \fBpnmcut\fP, plus
adds many additional functions, including the ability to process PAM
images.
.PP
\fBpnmcut\fP remains in the Netpbm package because it probably has
fewer bugs for now than \fBpamcut\fP.  Some day, \fBpnmcut\fP will
probably become an alias for \fBpamcut\fP.
.PP
You can use the \fBpamcut\fP documentation for \fBpnmcut\fP, as long
as you avoid any function which it says was added after Netpbm 9.20.
