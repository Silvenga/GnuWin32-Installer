.SH NAME

pnmpaste - paste a rectangle into a PNM image

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpnmpaste\fP

[\fB-replace\fP|\fB-or\fP|\fB-and\fP|\fB-xor\fP]

\fIfrompnmfile x y\fP

[\fIintopnmfile\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpnmpaste\fP reads two PNM images as input and inserts the first
image (the "pasted image") into the second (the "base image") at the
specified location, and produces a PNM image the same size and type as
the base image as output.  If you don't specify the second file,
\fBpnmpaste\fP reads the base image from Standard Input.
.PP
\fIx\fP and \fIy\fP specify the location in the base image at
which to put the top left corner of the pasted image, \fIx\fP giving
the horizontal position and \fIx\fP giving the vertical position.  A
nonnegative value indicates the number of pixels right of the right
edge or below the top edge of the base image, while a negative value
indicates the number of pixels right of the right edge or below the
bottom edge (so x = -5 means 5 pixels left of the right edge).
.PP
If any part of the pasted image does not fit within the base image,
\fBpnmpaste\fP fails.
.PP
This tool is most useful in combination with \fIpamcut\fP.  For
instance, if you want to edit a small segment of a large image, and
your image editor cannot edit the large image, you can cut out the
segment you are interested in, edit it, and then paste it back in.
.PP
Another useful companion tool is \fBpbmmask\fP.
.PP
\fBpamcomp\fP is a more general tool, except that it lacks the
\&'or,' 'and,' and 'xor' functions.
\fBpamcomp\fP allows you to specify an alpha mask in order to have
only part of the inserted image get inserted.  So the inserted pixels
need not be a rectangle.  You can also have the inserted image be
translucent, so the resulting image is a mixture of the inserted image
and the base image.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The optional flag specifies the operation to use when doing the
paste.  The default is \fB-replace\fP.  The other logical operations
are only allowed if both input images are PBM images.  These operations
act as if white is TRUE and black is FALSE.
.PP
You can abbreviate all options to their shortest unique prefix.
