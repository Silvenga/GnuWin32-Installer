.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpnmsmooth\fP smoothes out an image by replacing each pixel with
the average of its width X height neighbors.  It is implemented as a
progam that generates a PGM convolution matrix and then invokes
\fBpnmconvol\fP with it.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-size\fP \fIwidth\fP \fIheight\fP
Specifies the size of the convolution matrix.  Default size is a
3x3 matrix.  Width and height sizes must be odd.  Maximum size of
convolution matrix is limited by the maximum value for a pixel such
that (width * height * 2) must not exceed the maximum pixel value.

.TP
\fB-dump\fP \fIdumpfile\fP
This options makes \fBpnmsmooth\fP only generate and save the
convolution file.  It does not invoke \fBpnmconvol\fP and does not
produce an output image.
