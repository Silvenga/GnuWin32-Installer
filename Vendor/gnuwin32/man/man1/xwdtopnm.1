.SH NAME
xwdtopnm - convert an X11 or X10 window dump file to a PNM image

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBxwdtopnm\fP reads an X11 or X10 window dump file as input and
produces a PNM image as output.  The type of the output image depends
on the input file - if it's black and white, the output is PBM.  If
it's grayscale, the output is PGM.  Otherwise, it's PPM.  The program
tells you which type it is writing.
.PP
Using this program, you can convert anything you can display on an
X workstation's screen into a PNM image.  Just display whatever you're
interested in, run the \fBxwd\fP program to capture the contents of
the window, run it through \fBxwdtopnm\fP, and then use \fBpamcut\fP
to select the part you want.
.PP
Note that a pseudocolor XWD image (typically what you get when you
make a dump of a pseudocolor X window) has maxval 65535, which means
the PNM file that \fBxwdtopnm\fP generates has maxval 65535.  Many
older image processing programs (that aren't part of the Netpbm
package and don't use the Netpbm programming library) don't know how
to handle a PNM image with maxval greater than 255 (because there are
two bytes instead of one for each sample in the image).  So you may
want to run the output of \fBxwdtopnm\fP through \fBpnmdepth\fP
before feeding it to one of these old programs.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
This option causes \fBxwdtopnm\fP to display handy information about the
input image and the conversion process

.TP
\fB-headerdump\fP
This option causes \fBxwdtopnm\fP to display the contents of the
X11 header.  It has no effect when the input is X10.  This option was
new in Netpbm 10.26 (December 2004).
