.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBsldtoppm\fP reads an AutoCAD\*R slide file and outputs a PPM
image.  If you don't specify \fIslidefile\fP, \fBsldtoppm\fP reads
input from Standard Input.  \fBsldtoppm\fP uses the \fBppmdraw\fP
library to convert the vector and polygon information in the slide
file to a raster; see the file \fBppmdraw.h\fP for details on this
package.

.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-adjust\fP
If the display on which the slide file was created had non-square
pixels, when you process the slide with \fBsldtoppm\fP and don't
specify \fB-adjust\fP, \fBsldtoppm\fP issues the following warning;

.nf
Warning - pixels on source screen were non-square.
.fi
.sp
Specifying \fB-adjust\fP will correct the image width to
compensate.  Specifying the \fB-adjust\fP option causes
\fBsldtoppm\fP to scale the width of the image so that pixels in the
resulting portable pixmap are square (and hence circles appear as true
circles, not ellipses).  The scaling is performed in the vector
domain, before scan converting the objects.  The results are,
therefore, superior in appearance to what you'd obtain were you to
perform the equivalent scaling with \fBpamscale\fP after the bitmap
had been created.

.TP
\fB-dir\fP
The input is assumed to be an AutoCAD slide library file.  A
directory listing each slide in the library is printed on standard
error.

.TP
\fB-height\fP \fIsize\fP
Scales the image in the vector domain so it is \fIsize\fP pixels
in height.  If you don't specify \fB-width\fP or \fB-xsize\fP,
\fBsldtoppm\fP adjusts the width to preserve the pixel aspect ratio.

.TP
\fB-info\fP
Dump the slide file header on standard error, displaying the original
screen size and aspect ratio among other information.

.TP
\fB-lib\fP \fIname\fP
Extracts the slide with the given \fIname\fP from the slide
library given as input.  \fBsldtoppm\fP converts the specified
\fIname\fP to upper case.

.TP
\fB-Lib\fP\fI name\fP
Extracts the slide with the given \fIname\fP from the slide
library given as input.  \fBsldtoppm\fP uses \fIname\fP in the case
specified; it does not convert it to upper case.

.TP
\fB-scale\fP \fIs\fP
Scales the image by factor \fIs\fP, which may be any floating
point value greater than zero.  \fBsldtoppm\fP does the scaling after
aspect ratio adjustment, if any.  Since it does the scaling in the
vector domain, before rasterisation, the results look much better than
running the output of \fBsldtoppm\fP through \fBpamscale\fP.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Dumps the slide file header and lists every vector and polygon 
to Standard Error.

.TP
\fB-width\fP \fIsize\fP
Scales the image in the vector domain so it is \fIsize\fP pixels
wide.  If you don't specify \fB-height\fP or \fB-ysize\fP,
\fBsldtoppm\fP adjusts the height to preserve the pixel aspect ratio.

.TP
\fB-xsize\fP \fIsize\fP
Scales the image in the vector domain so it is \fIsize\fP pixels
wide.  If you don't specify \fB-height\fP or \fB-ysize\fP,
\fBsldtoppm\fP adjusts the height to preserve the pixel aspect ratio.

.TP
\fB-ysize\fP \fIsize\fP
Scales the image in the vector domain so it is \fIsize\fP pixels
in height.  If you don't specify \fB-width\fP or \fB-xsize\fP,
\fBsldtoppm\fP adjusts the width to preserve the pixel aspect ratio.



.UN lbAF
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
\fBsldtoppm\fP can convert only Level 2 slides.  Level 1 format
has been obsolete since the advent of AutoCAD Release 9 in 1987, and
was not portable across machine architectures.
.PP
Slide library items with names containing 8 bit (such as ISO) or 16
bit (Kanji, for example) characters may not be found when chosen with
the \fB-lib\fP option unless \fBsldtoppm\fP was built with character
set conversion functions appropriate to the locale.  You can always
retrieve slides from libraries regardless of the character set by
using the \fB-Lib\fP option and specifying the precise name of
library member.  Use the \fB-dir\fP option to list the slides in a
library if you're unsure of the exact name.
