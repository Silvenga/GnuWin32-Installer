.SH NAME

ppmtopict - convert a PPM image to a Macintosh PICT file

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmtopict\fP

[\fIppmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmtopict\fP reads a PPM image as input and produces a
Macintosh PICT file as output.
.PP
The generated file is only the data fork of a picture.  You will need
a program such as \fImcvert\fP to generate a Macbinary or a BinHex
file that contains the necessary information to identify the file as a
PICT file to MacOS.
.PP
Even though PICT supports 2 and 4 bits per pixel, \fBppmtopict\fP
always generates an 8 bits per pixel file.

.UN lbAE
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
The picture size field is correct only if the output is to a file
since writing into this field requires seeking backwards on a file.
However the PICT documentation seems to suggest that this field is not
critical anyway since it is only the lower 16 bits of the picture
size.
