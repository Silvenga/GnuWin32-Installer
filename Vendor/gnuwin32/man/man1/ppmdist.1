.SH NAME

ppmdist - simplistic grayscale assignment for machine generated, color images

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmdist\fP

[\fB-intensity\fP|\fB-frequency\fP]

[\fIppmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmdist\fP reads a PPM image as input and performs a simplistic
grayscale assignment intended for use with grayscale or bitmap
printers.
.PP
Often conversion from ppm to pgm will yield an image with contrast
too low for good printer output.  The program maximizes contrast
between the gray levels output.
.PP
A ppm input of n colors is read, and a pgm of n gray levels is
written.  The gray levels take on the values 0..n-1, while maxval
takes on n-1.
.PP
The mapping from color to stepped grayscale can be performed in
order of input pixel intensity, or input pixel frequency (number of
repetitions).
.PP
This program is helpful only for images with a very small number of
colors.


.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-frequency\fP
Sort input colors by the number of times a color appears in the
input, before mapping to evenly distributed graylevels of output.

.TP
\fB-intensity\fP
Sort input colors by their grayscale intensity, before mapping to
evenly distributed graylevels of output.  This is the default.
