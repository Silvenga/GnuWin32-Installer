.SH NAME

pnmdepth - change the maxval in a PNM image

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpnmdepth\fP

\fInewmaxval\fP

[\fIpnmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpnmdepth\fP reads a PNM image as input, scales all the pixel
values, and writes out the image with the new maxval.  Scaling the
colors down to a smaller maxval will result in some loss of
information.
.PP
Be careful of off-by-one errors when choosing the new maxval.  For
instance, if you want the color values to be five bits wide, use a
maxval of 31, not 32.
.PP
One important use of \fBpnmdepth\fP is to convert a new format
2-byte-per-sample PNM file to the older 1-byte-per-sample format.
Before April 2000, essentially all raw (binary) format PNM files had a
maxval less than 256 and one byte per sample, and many programs may
rely on that.  If you specify a \fInewmaxval\fP less than 256, the
resulting file should be readable by any program that worked with PNM
files before April 2000.
