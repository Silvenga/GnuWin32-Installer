.SH NAME

pgmtolispm - convert a PGM image to Lisp Machine format

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpgmtolispm\fP

[\fIpgmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpgmtolispm\fP reads a PGM image as input and produces a Lisp
Machine bitmap as output.
.PP
This is the file format read by the tv:read-bit-array-file function
on TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp machines.
.PP
Given a PGM (instead of a PBM), \fBpgmtolispm\fP outputs a
multi-plane image.  This is probably not useful unless you have a
color lisp machine.
.PP
Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the lispm image
file format does not include a color map, so we must treat it as a
graymap instead.  This is unfortunate.

.UN lbAF
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
Output width is always rounded up to the nearest multiple of 32;
this might not always be what you want, but it probably is (arrays
which are not modulo 32 cannot be passed to the Lispm BITBLT function,
and thus cannot easily be displayed on the screen).
.PP
No color.
