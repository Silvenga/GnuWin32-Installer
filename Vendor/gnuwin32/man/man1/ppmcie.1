.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).

\fBppmcie\fP creates a PPM file containing a plot of the CIE
\&'tongue' color chart -- to the extent possible in a PPM
image.  Alternatively, creates a pseudo-PPM image of the color tongue
using RGB values from a color system of your choice.
.PP
The CIE color tongue is an image of all the hues that can be described
by CIE X-Y chromaticity coordinates.  They are arranged on a two
dimensional coordinate plane with the X chromaticity on the horizontal
axis and the Y chromaticity on the vertical scale.  (You can choose
alternatively to use CIE u'-v' chromaticity coordinates, but the
general idea of the color tongue is the same).
.PP
Note that the PPM format specifies that the RGB values in the file are
from CIE Rec. 709 color system, gamma-corrected.  And positive.  See
.BR ppm (1) for details.  If you use one of the
color system options on \fBppmcie\fP, what you get is not a true PPM
image, but is very similar.  If you display such \fBppmcie\fP output
using a device that expects PPM input (which includes just about any
computer graphics display program), it will display the wrong colors.
.PP
However, you may have a device that expects one of these variations on 
PPM.
.PP
In every RGB color system you can specify, including the default
(which produces a true PPM image) there are hues in the color tongue
that can't be represented.  For example, monochromatic blue-green with 
a wavelength of 500nm cannot be represented in a PPM image.  
.PP
For these hues, \fBppmcie\fP substitutes a similar hue as follows:
They are desaturated and rendered as the shade where the edge of the
Maxwell triangle intersects a line drawn from the requested shade to
the white point defined by the color system's white point.
Furthermore, unless you specify the \fB-full\fP option, \fBppmcie\fP
reduces their intensity by 25% compared to the true hues in the image.
.PP
\fBppmcie\fP draws and labels the CIE X-Y coordinate axes unless you
choose otherwise with options.
.PP
\fBppmcie\fP draws the Maxwell triangle for the color system in use
on the color tongue.  The Maxwell triangle is the triangle whose
vertices are the primary illuminant hues for the color system.  The
hues inside the triangle show the color gamut for the color system.
They are also the only ones that are correct for the CIE X-Y
chromaticity coordinates shown.  (See explanation above).
.PP
\fBppmcie\fP also places a mark at the color system's white point and
displays in text the CIE X-Y chromaticities of the primary illuminants
and white point for the color system.  You can turn this off with
options, though.
.PP
\fBppmcie\fP annotates the periphery of the color tongue with the
wavelength, in nanometers of the monochromatic hues which appear
there.
.PP
Finally, \fBppmcie\fP displays the black body chromaticity curve for
Planckian radiators from 1000 to 30000 kelvins on the image.
.PP
You can choose from several standard color systems, or specify one of
your own numerically.
.PP
CIE charts, by their very nature, contain a very large number of
colors.  If you're encoding the chart for a color mapped device or
file format, you'll need to use \fBpnmquant\fP or \fBppmdither\fP to
reduce the number of colors in the image.

.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-rec709\fP
.TP
\fB-cie\fP
.TP
\fB-ebu\fP
.TP
\fB-hdtv\fP
.TP
\fB-ntsc\fP
.TP
\fB-smpte\fP
Select a standard color system whose gamut to plot.  The default is
\fB-rec709\fP, which chooses CIE Rec. 709, gamma-corrected.  This is
the only color system for which \fBppmcie\fP's output is a true PPM
image.  See explanation above.  \fB-ebu\fP chooses the primaries used
in the PAL and SECAM broadcasting standards.  \fB-ntsc\fP chooses the
primaries specified by the NTSC broadcasting system (few modern
monitors actually cover this range).  \fB-smpte\fP selects the
primaries recommended by the Society of Motion Picture and Television
Engineers (SMPTE) in standards RP-37 and RP-145, and \fB-hdtv\fP uses
the much broader \fIHDTV ideal\fP primaries.  \fB-cie\fP chooses a
color system that has the largest possible gamut within the spectrum
of the chart.  This is the same color system as you get with the
\fB-cie\fP option to John Walker's \fBcietoppm\fP program.

.TP
\fB-xy\fP
plot CIE 1931 x y chromaticities.  This is the default.

.TP
\fB-upvp\fP
plot u' v' 1976 chromaticities rather than CIE 1931 x y
chromaticities.  The advantage of u' v' coordinates is that equal
intervals of distance on the u' v' plane correspond roughly to the
eye's ability to discriminate colors.

.TP
\fB-red\fP\fI rx ry\fP
specifies the CIE \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP co-ordinates of the red
illuminant of a custom color system and selects the custom system.

.TP
\fB-green\fP\fI gx gy\fP
specifies the CIE \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP co-ordinates of the green
illuminant of the color system and selects the custom system.

.TP
\fB-blue\fP\fI bx by\fP
specifies the CIE \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP co-ordinates of the blue
illuminant of the color system and selects the custom system.

.TP
\fB-white\fP\fI wx wy\fP
specifies the CIE \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP co-ordinates of the white
point of the color system and selects the custom system.

.TP
\fB-size\fP\fI edge\fP
Create a pixmap of \fIedge\fP by \fIedge\fP pixels.  The default is
512x512.

.TP
\fB-xsize|-width\fP\fI width\fP
Sets the width of the generated image to \fIwidth\fP pixels.  The
default width is 512 pixels.  If the height and width of the image are
not the same, the CIE diagram will be stretched in the longer
dimension.

.TP
\fB-ysize|-height\fP\fI height\fP
Sets the height of the generated image to \fIheight\fP pixels.  The
default height is 512 pixels.  If the height and width of the image
are not the same, the CIE diagram will be stretched in the longer
dimension.

.TP
\fB-noblack\fP
Don't plot the black body chromaticity curve.

.TP
\fB-nowpoint\fP
Don't plot the color system's white point.

.TP
\fB-nolabel\fP
Omit the label.

.TP
\fB-noaxes\fP
Don't plot axes.

.TP
\fB-full\fP
Plot the entire CIE tongue in full intensity; don't enhance the gamut
of the specified color system.
