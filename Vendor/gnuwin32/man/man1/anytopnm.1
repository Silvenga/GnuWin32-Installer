.SH NAME
anytopnm - convert an arbitrary type of image file to PBM, PGM, or PPM

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBanytopnm\fP
[\fIfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBanytopnm\fP converts the input image, which may be in any of
dozens of graphics formats, to PBM, PGM, or PPM format, depending on
that nature of the input image, and outputs it to Standard Output.
.PP
To determine the format of the input, \fBanytopnm\fP uses the
\fBfile\fP program (possibly assisted by the magic numbers file
fragment included with Netpbm). If that fails
(very few image formats have magic numbers), \fBanytopnm\fP looks at
the filename extension.  If that fails, \fBanytopnm\fP
punts.
.PP
The type of the output file depends on the input image.
.PP
If \fBfile\fP indicates that the input file is compressed (either
via Unix compress, gzip, or bzip compression), \fBanytopnm\fP
uncompresses it and proceeds as above with the uncompressed result.
.PP
If \fBfile\fP indicates that the input file is encoded by uuencode
or btoa, \fBanytopnm\fP decodes it and proceeds as above with the
decoded result.
.PP
If \fIfile\fP is \fB-\fP or not given, \fBanytopnm\fP takes its
input from Standard Input.
