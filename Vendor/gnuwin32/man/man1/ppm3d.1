ppm3d - convert two PPM images into a red/blue 3d glasses PPM

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fIrightppmfile\fP
[\fIhorizontal_offset\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppm3d\fP reads two PPM images as input and produces a PPM as
output, with the images overlapping by \fIhorizontal_offset\fP pixels
in blue/red format.  The idea is that if you look at the image with
3-D glasses (glasses that admit only red through one eye and only green
through the other), you see an image with depth.  This is called a
stereogram.
.PP
\fIhorizontal_offset\fP defaults to 30 pixels.  The input PPMs
must be the same dimensions.
.PP
To make a different kind of stereogram, use \fBpamstereogram\fP.
That makes a steregram that you view without special glasses, just by
letting your eyes unfocus so that each eye sees different parts of the
image.
