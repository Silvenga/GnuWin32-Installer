The originator of this program and decipherer of the .411 format,
Steve Allen
<\fIsla@alumni.caltech.edu\fP>,
has this to say about the
utility of this program: 'There's so little image in a 64x48 thumbnail
(especially when you have the full size JPG file) that the only point
in doing this was to answer the implicit challenge posed by the manual
stating that only the camera can use these files.'
