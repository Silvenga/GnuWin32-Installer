.SH DESCRIPTION

Gri is a programming language for scientific graphics.  It can make
x-y graphs, contour-graphs, and image graphs.  In addition, Gri has a
full suite of low-level graphical elements and sufficient programming
capabilities (loops, subroutines, etc) to permit complex
customization.

Gri is not a point-click application.  In some ways it is analogous to
TeX.  Extensive power rewards tolerance of a modest learning curve.

For more information, please consult online 
.I info
and
.I html
manuals.

The 
.I info
manual is normally accessed by typing

.B	info gri

The 
.I html
manual is located at
.B /usr/doc/gri-N.N.N/html/index.html,
where 
.B N.N.N
is the version number.

The 
.I html
FAQ is located at
.B /usr/doc/gri-N.N.N/html/FAQ.html

.C There is also a 
.C .I reference card
.C in TeX and postscript formats.  See
.C .B /usr/doc/gri/refcard.*

.C The 
.C .I examples
.C in
.C .B /usr/doc/gri/examples/
.C are shown in the manual, and are included as a quick start primer.

.SH GRI_MERGE AND GRI_UNPAGE COMMANDS

Two Perl scripts are provided with Gri to manipulate the PostScript
output.  

.I gri_merge
is used to merge multiple Gri output files into a single PostScript file.
Type
.B gri_merge -h
for usage information.

.I gri_unpage
is used is split a multi-page Gri output file (in which the
.B new page
command was used) into separate PostScript files, one for each page.  Type
.B gri_unpage -h


.SH EMACS SUPPORT

An 
.I emacs
mode is provided with Gri.  
.C Consult the primer
.C 
.C .B /opt/gri/doc/gri/doc/README.gri-mode

The mode is installed automatically in Debian by the elisp file: 

.B /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50gri.el

The emacs mode itself is
.I gri-mode.el
and is installed on Debian as 
.B /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/gri-mode.el

Byte-compiled versions of this file are produced for every flavour of Emacs
that is installed, and are located in places like
.B /usr/share/emacs/20.2/site-lisp/gri-mode.elc


.C .SH INSTALLING MULTIPLE 2.12.10S 
.C 
.C Since the way Gri works sometimes changes with new versions, you may want
.C to keep old versions installed if an important script depends on it.  The
.C Debian packaging of Gri allows this.  Installing the next gri package
.C (named like gri_2.1.22-1_i386.deb) will replace your current version, but
.C Debian i386 (and perhaps alpha) packages will be made for older versions
.C which can be installed alongside the main gri package.  Look for a package
.C named like so:
.C 
.C .B gri-2.1.21_2.1.21-1_i386.deb
