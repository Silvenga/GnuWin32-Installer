.SH NAME
pbmtoepsi - convert a PBM image to an encapsulated PostScript
style preview bitmap

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmtoepsi\fP
[\fB-dpi=\fP\fIN\fP[\fBx\fP\fIN\fP]]
[\fB-bbonly\fP]
[\fIpbmfile\fP]
.PP
All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
You may use two hyphens instead of one.  You may separate an option
name and its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
Reads a PBM image as input.  Produces an encapsulated Postscript
style bitmap as output.  The output is not a stand alone postscript
file, it is only a preview bitmap, which can be included in an
encapsulated PostScript file.
.PP
\fBpbmtoepsi\fP assumes the PBM input describes a whole output
page, with one pixel on the page corresponding to one PBM pixel.  It
detects white borders in the image and generates Postscript output
that contains a Bounding Box statement to describe the location of the
principal image (the image excluding the white borders) on the page
and thus does not include the borders in the raster part of the
Postscript output.
.PP
There is no \fBepsitopbm\fP tool - this transformation is one way.

.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-dpi=\fP\fIN\fP[\fBx\fP\fIN\fP]
.sp
This option specifies the resolution in dots per inch of the
     ultimate output device.  You must specify this because the
     Bounding Box statement defines the bounding box in absolute
     distances, not in pixels.  \fBpbmtoepsi\fP assumes in
     calculating the bounding box that each PBM pixel will become one
     dot on the output device, and applies your \fBdpi\fP
     specification to calculate the size and location on the page of
     the bounding box.
.sp
If you specify \fIN\fP\fBx\fPN, the first number is the
     horizontal resolution and the second number is the vertical
     resolution.  If you specify just a single number \fIN\fP, that is the
     resolution in both directions.
.sp
The default is 72 dots per inch in both directions.
.sp
This option was new In Netpbm 10.3 (June 2002).  Before that, 
     \fBpbmtoepsi\fP always assumed 72 dots per inch in both directions.
     
.TP
\fB-bbonly\fP
Only create a boundary box, don't fill it with the image.
