.SH DESCRIPTION \"{{{
pgmfract computes a fractal and outputs it to standard output as PGM file.
Each $x, y$ pixel of the picture corresponds to the complex number $c = x + y i$ in the
formula $z' = z sup 2 + c$.  The first iteration begins with $z = x + i y$,
following iterations use the previously calculated value of $z'$.  As
soon as the absolute value of $z$ becomes larger than 2, it is known that
the iteration will converge against infinity and the pixel is coloured
depending on the number of iterations.  Some values of $c$ never cause $z$
to become larger than 2, so the iteration depth has to be limited.  If
this limit is reached, the pixel will be black.  The Mandelbrot set is
the set of values for $c$, which never cause $z$ to converge against
infinity, so limiting the depth causes a small error.  Using a large enough
depth minimizes this error.

.SH OPTIONS \"{{{
.IP "\fB\-s\fP \fIsize\fP"
Change the picture size from the default of 600 pixel in each direction
to \fIsize\fP pixels.
.IP "\fB\-d\fP \fIdepth\fP"
Change the maximum iteration depth from the default of 600 iterations
to \fIdepth\fP iterations.
.IP "\fB\-p\fP \fIxpos\fP\fB:\fP\fIypos\fP\fB:\fP\fIdistance\fP"
Change the interval of the complex start values from \fB0.0:0.0:2.0\fP
to the new center \fIxpos\fP an \fIypos\fP with an interval of \fIdistance\fP
in each direction.
.IP "\fB\-j\fP \fIcr\fP\fB:\fP\fIci\fP"
Compute a julia set instead of a mandelbrot set by specifying a fixed value
$c$ for iterations instead of a pixel dependent value $x + i y$.  Interesting
subsections from the mandelbrot set yield interesting julia sets.

.SH HISTORY \"{{{
The original version of this program has been written in 6502 Assembler
for an Acorn Electron in 1985.  From there, it went to Small-C for the
Z80 on a PCW8256 in 1986 to ANSI-C and Linux in 1998.
