.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBximptoppm\fP reads an Xim file as input and produces a PPM
image as output.  The Xim toolkit is included in the contrib tree of
the X.V11R4 release.

.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB--alphaout=\fP\fIalpha-filename\fP
\fBximtoppm\fP creates a PGM file containing the alpha channel
values in the input image.  If the input image doesn't contain an
alpha channel, the \fIalpha-filename\fP file contains all zero
(transparent) alpha values.  If you don't specify \fB--alphaout\fP,
\fBximtoppm\fP does not generate an alpha file, and if the input
image has an alpha channel, \fBximtoppm\fP simply discards it.
.sp
If you specify \fB-\fP as the filename, \fBximtoppm\fP writes the
alpha output to Standard Output and discards the image.
.sp
Actually, an Xim image can contain an arbitrary fourth channel --
it need not be an Alpha channel.  \fBximtoppm\fP extracts any fourth
channel it finds as described above; it doesn't matter if it is an
alpha channel or not.
.sp
See
.BR pamcomp (1) for one way to use
the alpha output file.
