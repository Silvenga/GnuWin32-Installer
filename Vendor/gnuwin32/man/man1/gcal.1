.TH GCAL 1 "June 14, 2000"
.SH NAME
Gcal \- a program for calculating and printing calendars.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gcal \fI[[Option\&...] [\fB%\fIDate] [\fB@\fIFile\&...]] [Command]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Gcal
is a program similar the standard calendar programs BSD\-`\fBcal\fI'
.ft R
and `\fBcalendar\fI'.
.ft R
.sp
.B Gcal
displays hybrid and proleptic Julian and Gregorian calendar sheets,
respectively, for one month, three months or a whole year.  It also
displays eternal holiday lists for many countries around the globe,
and features a very powerful creation of fixed date lists that can
be used for reminding purposes.  Gcal can calculate various astronomical
data and times of the Sun and the Moon for at pleasure any location,
precisely enough for most civil purposes.  Gcal supports some other
calendar systems, for example the Chinese and Japanese calendar,
the Hebrew calendar and the civil Islamic calendar, too.
.sp
If
.B Gcal
is started without any
.I options
or
.I commands,
a calendar of the current month is displayed.
.sp
If the calendar of a definite year is wanted, the year must be fully specified,
.EX
e.g.:  gcal 94
.EE
displays a year calendar of the year 94, not of the year 1994.
.sp
If two arguments are given in the
.I command
part, the first argument denotes the month and the second argument denotes the
year. In case any illegal
.I commands
are given running
.B Gcal
, the program will use internal defaults.
