.SH NAME
texi2dvi4a2ps \- Compile Texinfo and LaTeX files to DVI or PDF
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B texi2dvi4a2ps
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIFILE\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run each Texinfo or LaTeX FILE through TeX in turn until all
cross-references are resolved, building all indices.  The directory
containing each FILE is searched for included files.  The suffix of FILE
is used to determine its language (LaTeX or Texinfo).
.PP
Makeinfo is used to perform Texinfo macro expansion before running TeX
when needed.

texi2dvi4a2ps is exactly the same script as texi2dvi, part of the
package GNU Texinfo.  It is used by a2ps when delegating LaTeX and
Texinfo files.  Instead of checking whether the version of texi2dvi
which is installed is recent enough, it is more convenient for the
users that a2ps is shipped with the version of texi2dvi it requires.
