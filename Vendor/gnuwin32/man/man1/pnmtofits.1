.SH NAME

pnmtofits - convert a PNM image into FITS format

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpnmtofits\fP reads a PNM image as input and produces a FITS
(Flexible Image Transport System) file as output.  The resolution of
the output file is either 8 bits/pixel, or 16 bits/pixel, depending on
the value of maxval in the input file.  If the input file is a
portable bitmap or a portable graymap, the output file consists of a
single plane image (NAXIS = 2). If instead the input file is a
portable pixmap, the output file will consist of a three-plane image
(NAXIS = 3, NAXIS3 = 3).  You can find a full description of the FITS
format in Astronomy & Astrophysics Supplement Series 44 (1981),
page 363.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
You can use options \fB-min\fP and \fB-max\fP to set DATAMAX,
DATAMIN, BSCALE and BZERO in the FITS header, but not cause the data
to be rescaled.
