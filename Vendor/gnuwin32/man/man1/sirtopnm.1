.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).

\fBsirtopnm\fP reads a Solitaire Image Recorder file as input and
produces a PNM image as output.  The type of the output file depends
on the input file - if it's an MGI TYPE 17 file, \fBsirtopnm\fP
generates a PGM file.  If it's an MGI TYPE 11 file, \fBsirtopnm\fP
generates PPM.  The program tells you which type it is writing.
