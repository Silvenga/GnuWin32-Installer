.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBfitstopnm\fP reads a FITS file as input and produces a PPM
image if the FITS file consists of 3 image planes (NAXIS = 3 and
NAXIS3 = 3), or a PGM image if the FITS file consists of 2 image
planes (NAXIS = 2), or if you specify the \fB-image\fP option.  The
results may need to be flipped top for bottom; if so, just pipe the
output through \fBpamflip -tb\fP.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The \fB-image\fP option is for FITS files with three axes.  The
assumption is that the third axis is for multiple images, and this
option lets you select which one you want.
.PP
You can use options \fB-min\fP and \fB-max\fP to override the min
and max values as read from the FITS header or the image data if no
DATAMIN and DATAMAX keywords are found.
.PP
You can use the \fB-scanmax\fP option to force the program to scan
the data even when DATAMIN and DATAMAX are found in the header. If you
specify \fB-printmax\fP, the program will just print the min and max
values and quit.
.PP
The program tells you what kind of PNM image it is writing.
