.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I hp2xx
reads HPGL ASCII source files, interprets them, and converts them
into either another vector-oriented  format or one of several rasterfile
formats. Currently, its HPGL parser recognizes a large subset of HPGL/2.
Some high-level functions related to polygon filling are missing.
Also, only some of the fixed space vector fonts and none of the variable
space arc fonts are supported. Beside these limitations,
.I hp2xx
has proven to work with many HP-GL sources without any trouble.
.LP
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
.LP
.I hp2xx
reads from stdin or from a file if any given on the command line.
If no output file name is given (default), the output automatically
goes into a file whose name is derived from the input file name and the
current mode. For example,
.I hp2xx -m pcl foo.hpgl
writes the output to a file "foo.pcl". Use option
.I -f outfile
to specify your output file name explicitly, or
-I -f-
to write to stdout, e.g. when piping into a queue.

The program scans the current HPGL source, converts all drawing commands into
elementary vectors, saves these in a temporary file, and concurrently
determines the maximum coordinate range used. It then processes the vectors
by mapping them into a user-defined coordinate system, preserving the
aspect ratio of the original data.

This coordinate system by default fits into a window of
size 200 mm by 200 mm. To change the size of this bounding window, use
.I -h height
and
.I -w width
to set the (max.) desired height and width of your output picture;
optionally use
.I -a aspectfactor
to alter the aspect ratio by the given factor (aspectfactor < 1 narrows your
picture).
The generated picture will always fit into the window defined by -h height
and -w width, padded with background color at the lower or right margin
if needed.

A second way of defining sizes is relying on the size the picture
would actually show if plotted on a sheet of paper by a HP-compatible
plotter. By activating flag
-I -t
(true size), options -a, -h, and -w are ignored, and the sizes are
derived from the HP-GL file assuming that 1 HP unit = 1/40 mm.

Option
.I -r rotation_angle (in degrees)
allows you to rotate the object prior to all scaling operations. Its main
use is to facilitate landscape format: -r90 rotates your whole picture,
e.g. from portait to landscape format. However, any reasonable rotation
angle is valid.

By naming a file with option
.I -l log_file
you can redirect the diagnostic outputs into the given file, even without
a redirection mechanism for stderr like in UNIX shells (e. g., DOS).
Option
.I -q
(quiet) gets rid of them completely.

If you need to process a series of similar objects which should be translated
into exactly the same coordinate system, there is a way to override the
auto-scaling: First, run all files separately and note the infos on the
used coordinate ranges. Then, pick a range that will cover ALL your pictures.
You can now assign defaults to the internally generated range limits by
specifying
.I -x xmin,
.I -X xmax,
.I -y ymin,
and
.I -Y ymax.
NOTE: Clipping is only supported via the IW command ! If any picture 
coordinate exceeds your limits, they will be overwritten.

Use option
.I -m mode
to select the program mode, i.e. the output format. Currently supported:
mode = "mf" (Metafont), "em" (emTeX \special{} commands), "epic"
(line drawing using TeX macros within epic.sty), "eps" (PostScript),
"dxf" (Autocad), "emf/emp" (MS Enhanced Metafile / Printing - available
in Windows-built executables only), "svg" (Scalable Vector Graphics),
"fig" (XFig 3.2), "gpt" (GnuPlot ascii), "hpgl" (simplified HP-GL, 
e.g. for import tasks), "pcl" (HP-PCL Level 3 format (suitable for printing 
on a HP Laserjet II, DeskJet, or compatible printer), "escp2" (Epson Esc/P2
printer commands, suitable for printing on Epson Stylus models),
"img" (GEMs IMG format), "jpg" (JPEG image), "pdf" (Adobe Portable Document format),
"pbm" (Portable Bit Map / Portable PixMap for color plots), "pcx" (PC-Paintbrush format, also accepted by 
MS-Paintbrush / Windows 3.0 and many other PC based pixel renderers), 
"png" (Portable Network Graphics format), "nc" (CNC G-code, for engravings),
or "rgip" (Uniplex RGIP).
There is also a preview option "pre" which supports VGA cards (DOS),
ATARI, AMIGA, X11 servers, and Sunview. Default mode is "pre".
(As some of these modes rely on external libraries, they may not be builtin
by default, and not be available in prebuilt binaries supplied e.g. in
Linux distributions. The usage messsage generated when hp2xx is invoked without
parameters will always list exactly those modes that are actually available.)

If you use a raster format, the picture is rasterized by default into a
75 DPI resolution image. Use option
.I -d DPI_value
to change the resolution, e.g. -d300 will cause a HP LJ-II compatible
300 dpi rasterization. There is a way of specifying a different resolution
for y direction:
.I -D DPI_y_value

Some programs were found to generate HPGL output with too tight clipping
bounds, which lead, for example, to some parts of text characters clipped off.
Use option
.I -e extraclip
to add some extra amount of space to clip areas to workaround such mistakes.
For example, -e 40 will add 40 extra plotter units to every side of clipping
box which is 1 mm in true size.

While processing large pictures
at high resolution on low-memory machines, typically under DOS, the program
may start swapping. Optionally change the swap file by using
.I -s swapfile,
e.g. to speed up processing by swapping to a RAM disk.

Unless the hpgl file specifies its own selection of pen widths and colors
(for up to 256 pens), a carousel of 8 pens is simulated. You can specify 
pen sizes and colors for each of these pens via options
.I -p string
and
.I -c string.
"string" must consist of 1..8 digits (0-9 for size, 0-7 for color).
Digit number n (counting from left) corresponds to pen number n.
The digit value is this pen's color or size in internal units.
The pen width unit corresponds to 1/10 mm - using pen widths beyond 0.9mm
is possible by using the letters of the latin alphabet, so that A=1mm,
B=1.1mm etc. The default size is 1 for all pens. 
Colors are assigned according to:
0=off, 1=black, 2=red, 3=green, 4=blue, 5=cyan, 6=magenta, 7=yellow.
Examples of use:
.I -p22222222 -c33333333
changes all pensizes to 2 units, all colors to green
.I -p302 -c407
makes pen #1 a blue pen of size 3 , pen #3 a yellow pen of size 2,
suppresses all drawing with pen #2,
and keeps all other pen sizes and colors.
Setting either -p or -c will override the equivalent HPGL/2 commands
(PC,PW) in the HP-GL file.

Sometimes, HP-GL files contain several pages of plotter output.
.I hp2xx
recognizes the HP-GL commands for "feed-forward", "pause" or "new page", and by
default draws each image as a separate page (saving to sequentially numbered
output files, or opening a new preview window for each). You can select any
particular page range by using option
.I -P firstpage:lastpage
which causes
.I hp2xx
to skip all drawing commands except those on the given pages.
Please note that even if only a single page is actually drawn,
.I hp2xx
will nonetheless process the whole HP-GL file. This makes sure that
effects of early pages on internal modes indeed influence later pages,
as on a real plotter.
.LP
.SH VECTOR FORMATS
.LP
Supported vector formats are:
.I TeX/Metafont,
.I emTex-specials,
.I TeX/epic-Macros,
.I Autocad DXF
.I CNC G-code
.I XFig 3.2,
.I GnuPlot ASCII,
.I Simplified HP_GL,
.I Uniplex RGIP
.I Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
.I Adobe PDF(if libpdf is available)
and
-I PostScript.
Use
.I -m mf
to convert a HPGL drawing into a Metafont character to be included
into a TeX document as the character "Z" of a special font that you may
create. Edit the metafont source, e.g., to change the letter "Z" for
another, or to change the line thickness, which is set to 0.4pt by default.
The other TeX-related modes ("cad" for TeXcad compatible code, "em" for
employing \special{em:line} macros, and "epic" for drawing lines with
macros from "epic.sty") address different compromises to cope with TeX's
poor line drawing capability and are generally not recommended nor fully
supported. Feel free to experiment with them -- they generate ASCII output
that should be "input" into TeX/LaTeX documents.

Use option
.I -p pensize(s)
for control over pensize: The actual Metafont or PostScript pensize will be
"pensize * 0.1 mm", with pensize = 0 - 9 (0 = no drawing).
The same applies to

In PostScript mode
.I (-m eps),
you may also need to use options -o and -O (see below)
for proper margins on paper since
.I hp2xx
puts your picture "flush" to the left and upper paper limit by default.
.LP
.SH RASTER FORMATS
.LP
The following formats are supported: HP-PCL, Esc/P2, PCX, PIC, IMG, JPG, PBM/PPM, PNG, TIFF, and previews. (PNG and TIFF formats rely on external libpng,zlib and libtiff, JPG relies on libjpeg. Versions built on MS windows systems - or versions linked against libEMF on other platforms - may additionally 
support EMF generation and printing.)

Addition of other formats is made easy for programmers because of
.I hp2xx's
modular structure. The program allocates a bitmap on a line-by-line basis,
swapping lines to disk if needed, and plots into this bitmap. Depending
on the selected format, a conversion module is then activated, which can
easily be replaced by other converters. Add more formats if you like!

Option
.I -p pensize(s)
controls the size (in pixels) of the virtual plotting pen. The only
implemented shape of the pen tip is a square of the given length.
pen sizes of 5...9 units will be acccepted but replaced by 4 units.
Specifying -p4 when in 75 DPI mode
will make pretty clumsy pictures,
while you may prefer -p2 over -p1 when in 300 DPI.

PCX: The size of a PCX picture is controlled via its specified height and
the current DPI value. To create a high-resolution PCX image, just increase
the DPI value as desired. PCX format does not accept offsets.

IMG: See PCX.

PBM/PPM: See PCX for options. If your hpgl file is not monochrome, hp2xx
will automatically create a PPM (portable pixmap) file instead of a PBM
bitmap. (Use -c11111111 to force generation of PBM from a color hpgl file).
Depending on the compile-time option PBM_ASCII, hp2xx will create ascii or
binary pbm (ppm) files - usually the more efficient binary format should be
preferred.

(Unsupported options) PIC, PAC: ATARI ST screens (640x400 pixels) can
easily be dumped to files. Programs such as STAD accept graphics by
including such screen dump files.
Graphics filling more than one screenful may be split into screen-size
blocks and loaded/mounted blockwise.
.I hp2xx
converts to ATARI bitmap format by trying to fit the resulting picture
into a single screen equivalent (max. 400 rows, max. 80 Bytes (640 pixel)
per row). If it succeeds,
.I hp2xx
produces a single output file. Specify ONLY its base name (option -f), since
.I hp2xx
adds the file extension ".pic" or ".pac" automatically. Do NOT try to work
on more than one HPGL file simultaneously! Do NOT use more than 6 characters
for the file name, and avoid digits. If more screen blocks are required
horizontally and/or vertically,
.I hp2xx
will automatically split the picture into separate files, counting them
columnwise (top-to-bottom and left-to-right), adding a two-digit number
to the given file name. A maximum of 10 columns is supported.
The picture is padded with background color at its right and lower margins,
if needed. PAC features file compression, PIC does not.


PCL: HP-PCL Level 3 format, most useful for direct printer output. Due to
this action, there have been added some extra flags and options: Use flag
.I -i
to send a printer initialization sequence before the actual image. Among
other things, this will instruct the printer which paper size to use. Flag
.I -F
adds a Form Feed (FF, hex 0C) after the image is completed, which is what
you may want most of the time. However, overlay printing of several files
is feasible by omitting -F.

For additional control of the picture's final position on paper, you may
add x or y offsets using
.I -o X_offset
or
.I -O Y_offset. E.g., -o 20 -O 30 will give you 30 mm additional top margin
and 20 mm additional left margin. Option -C modifies these offsets to
center the picture within the frame defined by -w -h.

The option
.I -C
will attempt to center the drawing on the paper automatically. Note also
that 
.I hp2xx
now honors any PS (page size) commands in the hpgl file, which can also
create white space around the actual drawing.

The option
.I -N
will make hp2xx ignore any PS commands given in the hpgl file, and recalculate
the image size based on the actual geometry instead.

The option
.I -n
will make hp2xx ignore any polygon filling commands, rendering only their
outlines. This may serve both as a work-around for hp2xx' limited polyfill
support, and improve clarity of thumbnail images of PCB designs and the like.
 
The option
.I -M pennumber
will remap any color or drawing commands from pen 0 to the specified pen
(which should typically be otherwise unused in the drawing). Historically,
selecting pen 0 instructed a pen plotter to put away the pen and stop
drawing, while modern inkjet plotters can use it like any other color. Due
to this ambiguity, hp2xx will draw the background of raster graphics in the
pen 0 color, unless this option is used.

For DeskJet / DeskJet Plus / DeskJet 500 / Deskjet 550 printers, there are
some special printer commands. Activate them with option
.I -S n.
n=0 switches them off, n=1 activates black/white mode, n=3 (DJ500C and DJ550
only) supports CMY color data, n=4 (DJ550C only) supports CMYK color data.
Any n!=0 activates PLC data compression (TIFF mode: 2).

Esc/P2: This is the control language used in the Epson Stylus family of
inkjets. 
.I hp2xx
currently does not address more than one line of nozzles in the print head,
so printing, while exact, is extremely slow. Users might prefer piping the
output of the PostScript module through 
.I ghostscript
until this issue is resolved.

PNG: Support for the Portable Network Graphics format relies on 
.I libpng
which is available from www.libpng.org.

PRE: Preview on all machines. Use options -h -w -o -O -C to define the screen
size and position of your output (-o -O -C may not always apply).
Under X11, you can pan around an image that is larger than the screen size
by 'dragging' it with the mouse (pressing button 1 while moving the mouse
in the desired direction). Any other mouse button or keyboard key will terminate
the preview.
For VGA cards (DOS), option
.I -V VGAmode
gives you a simple way to utilize SVGA modes. Please take
care not to define larger windows than your graphics device can handle,
as the results are unpredictable. As hp2xx uses standard BIOS calls to
set pixels on VGA cards (slow but portable), you can select any hi-res
mode supported by your system by simply specifying the mode byte with this
option.

TIFF: The tagged image file format is supported by most graphics and image
manipulation programs. Support for TIFF in 
.I hp2xx
relies on the 
.I TIFF library
available from www.libtiff.org, which offers several means of image compression.
The
.I -S
commandline option selects between them as follows:
.I -S 0 or -S 1: no compression
.I -S 2: RLE (run length encoding)
.I -S 3: Group 3 FAX (monochrome)
.I -S 4: Group 4 FAX (monochrome)
.I -S 5: GIF (not available by default, because of the UNISYS patent)
.I -S 6: JPEG ('old' TIFF 6.0 style)
.I -S 7: JPEG
.I -S 8: deflate

.LP
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
 % hp2xx -m pcx -f my_output.pcx -d300 -p2222 -h50 -a 1.2 my_input.hp

   creates a PCX file at 300 DPI of height 50 mm, using an aspect factor
   of 1.2 and a pen size of 2 pixels for pens 1-4.

 % my_hpgl_generator | hp2xx -f- -o20 -O30 -F -q | lpr -P my_PCL_printer

   HPGL output is piped through hp2xx; the resulting PCL code is piped to
   the printer queue, giving an image of height 100 mm at 75 DPI.
   An additional left margin of 20mm and upper margin of 30mm is created.
   A formfeed will be added (handy if your printer queue does not).

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
The number of ignored and/or unknown HPGL commands is given. You will be
informed if swapping starts. Progress is indicated by a logarithmic
count of internal vectors during scanning and plotting, or by dots
during (raster mode) output, where each dot corresponds to 10 scan lines.
.LP
.SH BUGS
There still are many non-implemented HPGL commands.

The color assignment of some X11 servers leaves something to be desired.

Color is only partially supported (not all possible formats).

VGA preview: Color "magenta" shows as brown on some VGA cards.

To match the specified sizes on your display during preview, you may have
to calibrate it using -d -D, e.g. by overwriting the 75 DPI default.

Only little testing has been done on TeX-related and ATARI formats,
so be prepared for bugs there, and PLEASE report them --  thank you!
