.SH NAME

pbmto4425 - Display PBM images on an AT&T 4425 terminal

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmto4425\fP
[\fIpbmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).

\fBpbmto4425\fP displays PBM format images on an AT&T 4425 ASCII
terminal using that terminal's mosaic graphics character set.  The
program should also work with other VT100-like terminals with mosaic
graphics character sets such as the C. Itoh CIT-101, but it has not
yet been tested on terminals other than the 4425.
.PP
 \fBPbmto4425\fP puts the terminal into 132 column mode to achieve
the maximum resolution of the terminal.  In this mode the terminal has
a resolution of 264 columns by 69 rows.  The pixels have an aspect
ratio of 1:2.6, therefore an image should be processed before being
displayed in a manner such as this:


.nf
\fB% pamscale -xscale 2.6 \fP\fIpamfile\fP \fB\
    | pamscale -xysize 264 69 \
    | ppmtopgm \
    | pamditherbw \
    | pbmto4425\fP
