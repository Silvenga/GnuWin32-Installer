pjtoppm - convert an HP PaintJet file to a PPM image

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpjtoppm\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpjtoppm\fP reads an HP PaintJet file as input and converts it
into a PPM image.  This was a quick hack to save some trees, and it
only handles a small subset of the paintjet commands.  In particular,
it will only handle enough commands to convert most raster image
files.
