.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBasciitopgm\fP reads ASCII data as input and produces a PGM image
with pixel values which are an approximation of the
\&'brightness' of the ASCII characters, assuming
black-on-white printing.  In other words, a capital M is very dark, a
period is very light, and a space is white.
.PP
Obviously, \fBasciitopgm\fP assumes a certain font in assigning
a brightness value to a character.
.PP
\fBasciitopgm\fP considers ASCII control characters to be all
white.  It assigns special brightnesses to lower case letters which
have nothing to do with what they look like printed.
\fBasciitopgm\fP takes the ASCII character code from the lower 7 bits
of each input byte.  But it warns you if the most signficant bit of
any input byte is not zero.
.PP
Input lines which are fewer than \fIwidth\fP characters are
automatically padded with spaces.
.PP
The \fIdivisor\fP value is an integer (decimal) by which the
blackness of an input character is divided; the default value is 1.
You can use this to adjust the brightness of the output: for example,
if the image is too bright, increase the divisor.
.PP
In keeping with (I believe) Fortran line-printer conventions,
input lines beginning with a \fB+\fP (plus) character are assumed to
\&'overstrike' the previous line, allowing a larger range of
gray values.
.PP
If you're looking for something that creates an image of text,
with that text specified in ASCII, that is something quite different.
Use \fBpbmtext\fP for that.
