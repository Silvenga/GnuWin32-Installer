.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpbmtomacp\fP reads a PBM image as input and produces a MacPaint
file as output.
.PP
If you do not specify \fIpbmfile\fP, \fBpbmtomacp\fP uses Standard Input.
.PP
 The generated file is only the data fork of a picture.  You will
need a program such as \fBmcvert\fP to generate a Macbinary or a
BinHex file that contains the necessary information to identify the
file as a PNTG file to MacOS.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
 \fB-l\fP, \fB-r\fP, \fB-b\fP, and \fB-t\fP let you define a
square into the pbm file, that must be converted.  Default is the
whole file.  If the file is too large for a MacPaint-file, the bitmap
is cut to fit from ( left, top ).
