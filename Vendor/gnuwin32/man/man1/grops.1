.OP \-I dir
.OP \-p papersize

It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
parameter.
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B grops
translates the output of GNU
.B troff
to PostScript.
.
Normally
.B grops
should be invoked by using the groff command
with a
.B \-Tps
option.
.
.if 'ps'ps' (Actually, this is the default for groff.)
.
If no files are given,
.B grops
reads the standard input.
.
A filename of
.B \-
also causes
.B grops
to read the standard input.
.
PostScript output is written to the standard output.
.
When
.B grops
is run by
.B groff
options can be passed to
.B grops
using
.BR groff 's
.B \-P
option.
.
.LP
Note that
.B grops
doesn't produce a valid document structure (conforming to the Document
Structuring Convention) if called with multiple file arguments.
.
To print such concatenated output it is necessary to deactivate DSC
handling in the printing program or previewer.
.
See section
.B FONT INSTALLATION
below for a guide how to install fonts for
.BR grops .
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.BI \-b n
Provide workarounds for older printers, broken spoolers, and previewers.
.
Normally
.B grops
produces output at PostScript LanguageLevel\~2 that conforms to the
Document Structuring Conventions version 3.0.
.
Some older printers, spoolers, and previewers can't handle such output.
.
The value of\~\c
.I n
controls what
.B grops
does to make its output acceptable to such programs.
.
A value of\~0 causes grops not to employ any workarounds.
.
.IP
Add\~1 if no
.B %%Begin\%Document\%Setup
and
.B %%End\%Document\%Setup
comments should be generated;
this is needed for early versions of TranScript that get confused by
anything between the
.B %%End\%Prolog
comment and the first
.B %%Page
comment.
.
.IP
Add\~2 if lines in included files beginning with
.B %!\&
should be stripped out; this is needed for Sun's pageview previewer.
.
.IP
Add\~4 if
.BR %%Page ,
.BR %%Trailer
and
.B %%End\%Prolog
comments should be
stripped out of included files; this is needed for spoolers that
don't understand the
.B %%Begin\%Document
and
.B %%End\%Document
comments.
.
.IP
Add\~8 if the first line of the PostScript output should be
.B %!PS-Adobe-2.0
rather than
.BR %!PS-Adobe-3.0 ;
this is needed when using Sun's Newsprint with a printer that requires
page reversal.
.
.IP
Add\~16 if no media size information should be included in the document
(this is, neither use
.B %%Document\%Media
nor the
.B setpagedevice
PostScript command).
.
This was the behaviour of groff version 1.18.1 and earlier; it is needed
for older printers which don't understand PostScript LanguageLevel\~2.
.
It is also necessary if the output is further processed to get an
encapsulated PS (EPS) file \[en] see below.
.
.IP
The default value can be specified by a
.
.RS
.IP
.BI broken\  n
.
.LP
command in the DESC file.
.
Otherwise the default value is\~0.
.RE
.
.TP
.BI \-c n
Print
.I n
copies of each page.
.
.TP
.BI \-F dir
Prepend directory
.IB dir /dev name
to the search path for prologue, font, and device description files;
.I name
is the name of the device, usually
.BR ps .
.
.TP
.BI \-g
Guess the page length.
.
This generates PostScript code that guesses the page length.
.
The guess is correct only if the imageable area is vertically
centered on the page.
.
This option allows you to generate documents that can be printed
both on letter (8.5\[mu]11) paper and on A4 paper without change.
.
.TP
.BI \-I dir
This option may be used to add a directory to the search path for
files on the command line and files named in
.B \[rs]X'ps: import'
and
.B \[rs]X'ps: file'
escapes.
.
The search path is initialized with the current directory.
.
This option may be specified more than once; the directories are then
searched in the order specified (but before the current directory).
.
If you want to make the current directory be read before other directories,
add
.B \-I.\&
at the appropriate place.
.
.IP
No directory search is performed for files with an absolute file name.
.
.TP
.B \-l
Print the document in landscape format.
.
.TP
.B \-m
Turn manual feed on for the document.
.
.TP
.BI \-p paper-size
Set physical dimension of output medium.
.
This overrides the
.BR papersize ,
.BR paperlength ,
and
.B paperwidth
commands in the
.B DESC
file; it accepts the same arguments as the
.B papersize
command.
.
See
.B groff_font (5)
for details.
.
.TP
.BI \-P prologue-file
Use the file
.I prologue-file
(in the font path) as the prologue instead of the default prologue file
.BR prologue .
.
This option overrides the environment variable
.SM GROPS_PROLOGUE.
.
.TP
.BI \-w n
Lines should be drawn using a thickness of
.IR n \~\c
thousandths of an em.
.
If this option is not given, the line thickness defaults to 0.04\~em.
.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.
.
.SH USAGE
.
The input to
.B grops
must be in the format output by
.BR troff (1).
.
This is described in
.BR groff_out (5).
.
.LP
In addition, the device and font description files for the device used
must meet certain requirements:
.
The resolution must be an integer multiple of\~72 times the
.BR sizescale .
.
The
.B ps
device uses a resolution of 72000 and a sizescale of 1000.
.
.LP
The device description file must contain a valid paper size; see
.BR groff_font (5)
for more information.
.
.LP
Each font description file must contain a command
.IP
.BI internalname\  psname
.LP
which says that the PostScript name of the font is
.IR psname .
.
It may also contain a command
.IP
.BI encoding\  enc_file
.LP
which says that
the PostScript font should be reencoded using the encoding described in
.IR enc_file ;
this file should consist of a sequence of lines of the form:
.IP
.I
pschar code
.LP
where
.I pschar
is the PostScript name of the character,
and
.I code
is its position in the encoding expressed as a decimal integer; valid
values are in the range 0 to\~255.
.
Lines starting with
.B #
and blank lines are ignored.
.
The code for each character given in the font file must correspond
to the code for the character in encoding file, or to the code in the default
encoding for the font if the PostScript font is not to be reencoded.
.
This code can be used with the
.B \[rs]N
escape sequence in
.B troff
to select the character,
even if the character does not have a groff name.
.
Every character in the font file must exist in the PostScript font, and
the widths given in the font file must match the widths used
in the PostScript font.
.
.B grops
assumes that a character with a groff name of
.B space
is blank (makes no marks on the page);
it can make use of such a character to generate more efficient and
compact PostScript output.
.
.LP
Note that
.B grops
is able to display all glyphs in a PostScript font, not only 256.
.I enc_file
(or the default encoding if no encoding file specified) just defines the
order of glyphs for the first 256 characters; all other glyphs are
accessed with additional encoding vectors which
.B grops
produces on the fly.
.
.LP
.B grops
can automatically include the downloadable fonts necessary
to print the document.
.
Such fonts must be in PFA format.
.
Use
.BR \%pfbtops (1)
to convert a Type\~1 font in PFB format.
.
Any downloadable fonts which should, when required, be included by
.B grops
must be listed in the file
.BR c:/progra~1/groff/share/groff/1.20.1/font/devps/download ;
this should consist of lines of the form
.
.IP
.I
font filename
.
.LP
where
.I font
is the PostScript name of the font,
and
.I filename
is the name of the file containing the font;
lines beginning with
.B #
and blank lines are ignored;
fields may be separated by tabs or spaces;
.I filename
is searched for using the same mechanism that is used
for groff font metric files.
.
The
.B download
file itself is also searched for using this mechanism;
currently, only the first found file in the font path is used.
.
.LP
If the file containing a downloadable font or imported document
conforms to the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions,
then
.B grops
interprets any comments in the files sufficiently to ensure that its
own output is conforming.
.
It also supplies any needed font resources that are listed in the
.B download
file
as well as any needed file resources.
.
It is also able to handle inter-resource dependencies.
.
For example, suppose that you have a downloadable font called Garamond,
and also a downloadable font called Garamond-Outline
which depends on Garamond
(typically it would be defined to copy Garamond's font dictionary,
and change the PaintType),
then it is necessary for Garamond to appear before Garamond-Outline
in the PostScript document.
.
.B grops
handles this automatically
provided that the downloadable font file for Garamond-Outline
indicates its dependence on Garamond by means of
the Document Structuring Conventions,
for example by beginning with the following lines
.
.IP
.B
%!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-Font
.br
.B
%%DocumentNeededResources: font Garamond
.br
.B
%%EndComments
.br
.B
%%IncludeResource: font Garamond
.
.LP
In this case both Garamond and Garamond-Outline would need to be listed
in the
.B download
file.
.
A downloadable font should not include its own name in a
.B %%Document\%Supplied\%Resources
comment.
.
.LP
.B grops
does not interpret
.B %%Document\%Fonts
comments.
.
The
.BR %%Document\%Needed\%Resources ,
.BR %%Document\%Supplied\%Resources ,
.BR %%Include\%Resource ,
.BR %%Begin\%Resource ,
and
.BR %%End\%Resource
comments
(or possibly the old
.BR %%Document\%Needed\%Fonts ,
.BR %%Document\%Supplied\%Fonts ,
.BR %%Include\%Font ,
.BR %%Begin\%Font ,
and
.BR %%End\%Font
comments)
should be used.
.
.LP
In the default setup
there are styles called
.BR R ,
.BR I ,
.BR B ,
and
.B BI
mounted at font positions 1 to\~4.
.
The fonts are grouped into families
.BR A ,

.FT
.RE
.
.LP
There are also some special fonts called
.B S
for the PS Symbol font, and
.BR SS ,
containing slanted lowercase Greek letters taken from PS Symbol.
.
Zapf Dingbats is available as
.BR ZD ,
and a reversed version of ZapfDingbats (with symbols pointing in the opposite
direction) is available as
.BR ZDR ;
most characters in these fonts are unnamed and must be accessed using
.BR \[rs]N .
.
.LP
The default color for
.B \[rs]m
and
.B \[rs]M
is black; for colors defined in the `rgb' color space
.B setrgbcolor
is used, for `cmy' and `cmyk'
.BR setcmykcolor ,
and for `gray'
.BR setgray .
.
Note that
.B setcmykcolor
is a PostScript LanguageLevel\~2 command and thus not available on some
older printers.
.
.LP
.B grops
understands various X\~commands produced using the
.B \[rs]X
escape sequence;
.B grops
only interprets commands that begin with a
.B ps:
tag.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]X'ps:\ exec\  code '
This executes the arbitrary PostScript commands in
.IR code .
.
The PostScript currentpoint is set to the position of the
.B \[rs]X
command before executing
.IR code .
.
The origin is at the top left corner of the page,
and y\~coordinates increase down the page.
.
A procedure\~\c
.B u
is defined that converts groff units
to the coordinate system in effect (provided the user doesn't change the
scale).
.
For example,
.
.RS
.IP
.B
\&.nr x 1i
.br
.B
\[rs]X'ps: exec \[rs]nx u 0 rlineto stroke'
.br
.RE
.
.IP
draws a horizontal line one inch long.
.
.I code
may make changes to the graphics state,
but any changes persist only to the end of the page.
.
A dictionary containing the definitions specified by the
.B def
and
.B mdef
is on top of the dictionary stack.
.
If your code adds definitions to this dictionary,
you should allocate space for them using
.BI \[rs]X'ps\ mdef \ n '\fR.
.
Any definitions persist only until the end of the page.
.
If you use the
.B \[rs]Y
escape sequence with an argument that names a macro,
.I code
can extend over multiple lines.
.
For example,
.
.RS
.IP
.nf
.ft B
\&.nr x 1i
\&.de y
\&ps: exec
\&\[rs]nx u 0 rlineto
\&stroke
\&..
\&\[rs]Yy
.ft R
.fi
.
.LP
is another way to draw a horizontal line one inch long.
.
Note the single backslash before `nx' \[en] the only reason to use a number
register while defining the macro `y' is to convert a user-specified
dimension `1i' to internal groff units which are in turn converted to PS
units with the
.B u
procedure.
.
.LP
.B grops
wraps user-specified PostScript code into a dictionary, nothing more.
.
In particular, it doesn't start and end the inserted code with
.B save
and
.BR restore ,
respectively.
.
This must be supplied by the user, if necessary.
.
.RE
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]X'ps:\ file\  name '
This is the same as the
.B exec
command except that the PostScript code is read from file
.IR name .
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]X'ps:\ def\  code '
Place a PostScript definition contained in
.I code
in the prologue.
.
There should be at most one definition per
.B \[rs]X
command.
.
Long definitions can be split over several
.B \[rs]X
commands;
all the
.I code
arguments are simply joined together separated by newlines.
.
The definitions are placed in a dictionary which is automatically
pushed on the dictionary stack when an
.B exec
command is executed.
.
If you use the
.B \[rs]Y
escape sequence with an argument that names a macro,
.I code
can extend over multiple lines.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]X'ps:\ mdef\  n\ code  '
Like
.BR def ,
except that
.I code
may contain up to
.IR n \~\c
definitions.
.
.B grops
needs to know how many definitions
.I code
contains
so that it can create an appropriately sized PostScript dictionary
to contain them.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]X'ps:\ import\  file\ llx\ lly\ urx\ ury\ width\ \fR[\fP\ height\ \fR]\fP '
Import a PostScript graphic from
.IR file .
.
The arguments
.IR llx ,
.IR lly ,
.IR urx ,
and
.I ury
give the bounding box of the graphic in the default PostScript
coordinate system; they should all be integers;
.I llx
and
.I lly
are the x and y\~coordinates of the lower left
corner of the graphic;
.I urx
and
.I ury
are the x and y\~coordinates of the upper right corner of the graphic;
.I width
and
.I height
are integers that give the desired width and height in groff
units of the graphic.
.
.IP
The graphic is scaled so that it has this width and height
and translated so that the lower left corner of the graphic is
located at the position associated with
.B \[rs]X
command.
.
If the height argument is omitted it is scaled uniformly in the
x and y\~directions so that it has the specified width.
.
.IP
Note that the contents of the
.B \[rs]X
command are not interpreted by
.BR troff ;
so vertical space for the graphic is not automatically added,
and the
.I width
and
.I height
arguments are not allowed to have attached scaling indicators.
.
.IP
If the PostScript file complies with the Adobe Document Structuring
Conventions and contains a
.B %%Bounding\%Box
comment, then the bounding box can be automatically
extracted from within groff by using the
.B psbb
request.

.B \[rs]X'ps:\ invis'
.TQ
.B \[rs]X'ps:\ endinvis'
No output is generated for text and drawing commands
that are bracketed with these
.B \[rs]X
commands.
.
These commands are intended for use when output from
.B troff
is previewed before being processed with
.BR grops ;
if the previewer is unable to display certain characters
or other constructs, then other substitute characters or constructs
can be used for previewing by bracketing them with these
.B \[rs]X
commands.
.
.RS
.LP
For example,
.B \%gxditview
is not able to display a proper
.B \[rs](em
character because the standard X11 fonts do not provide it;
this problem can be overcome by executing the following
request
.
.IP
.ft B
.nf
\&.char \[rs](em \[rs]X'ps: invis'\[rs]
\[rs]Z'\[rs]v'-.25m'\[rs]h'.05m'\[rs]D'l .9m 0'\[rs]h'.05m''\[rs]
\[rs]X'ps: endinvis'\[rs](em
.ft
.fi
.
.LP
In this case,
.B \%gxditview
is unable to display the
.B \[rs](em
character and draws the line,
whereas
.B grops
prints the
.B \[rs](em
character
and ignores the line (this code is already in file
.B Xps.tmac
which is loaded if a document intended for
.B grops
is previewed with
.BR \%gxditview ).

If a PostScript procedure
.B BPhook
has been defined via a

or
.RB ` ps:\ mdef '
device command, it is executed at the beginning
of every page (before anything is drawn or written by groff).

.SS TrueType and other font formats
TrueType fonts can be used with
.B grops
if converted first to
.B "Type\~42"
format, a special PostScript wrapper equivalent to the
PFA format mentioned in
.BR \%pfbtops (1).
.
There are several different methods to generate a type42
wrapper and most of them involve the use of a PostScript
interpreter such as Ghostscript \[en] see
.BR gs (1).
.
.LP
Yet, the easiest method involves the use of the application
.BR ttftot42 (1).
.
This program uses
.BR freetype (3)
(version 1.3.1) to generate type42
font wrappers and well-formed AFM files that can be fed to
the
.BR \%afmtodit (1)

The resulting font wrappers should be added to the

file.

Another solution for creating type42 wrappers is to use FontForge,

This font editor can convert most outline font formats.

.SH FONT INSTALLATION

This section gives a summary of the above explanations; it can serve
as a step-by-step font installation guide for
.BR grops .

Convert your font to something groff understands.
.
This is either a PostScript Type\~1 font in PFA format or a
PostScript Type\~42 font, together with an AFM file.
.
.IP
The very first characters in a PFA file look like this:
.
.RS
.IP
.B %!PS-AdobeFont-1.0:
.RE
.
.IP
A PFB file has this also in the first line, but the string is
preceded with some binary bytes.
.
.IP
The very first characters in a Type\~42 font file look like this:
.
.RS
.IP
.B %!PS-TrueTypeFont
.RE
.
.IP
This is a wrapper format for TrueType fonts.
.
Old PS printers might not support it (this is, they don't have a
built-in TrueType font interpreter).
.
.IP
If your font is in PFB format (such fonts normally have `.pfb' as
the file extension), you might use groff's
.BR \%pfbtops (1)
program to convert it to PFA.
.
For TrueType fonts, try
.B ttftot42
or
.BR fontforge .
For all other font formats use
.B fontforge
which can convert most outline font formats.
.
.LI
Convert the AFM file to a groff font description file with the
.BR \%afmtodit (1)
program.
.
An example call is
.
.RS
.IP
afmtodit Foo-Bar-Bold.afm textmap FBB
.RE
.
.IP
which converts the metric file `Foo-Bar-Bold.afm' to the groff
font `FBB'.
.
If you have a font family which comes with normal, bold, italic,
and bold italic faces, it is recommended to use the letters
.BR R ,
.BR B ,
.BR I ,
and
.BR BI ,
respectively, as postfixes in the groff font names to make groff's
`.fam' request work.
.
An example is groff's built-in Times-Roman font: The font family name
is
.BR T ,
and the groff font names are
.BR TR ,
.BR TB ,
.BR TI ,
and
.BR TBI .
.
.LI
Install both the groff font description files and the fonts in a
`devps' subdirectory of the font path which groff finds.
.
See the
.B ENVIRONMENT
section in the
.BR troff (1)
man page which lists the actual value of the font path.
.
Note that groff doesn't use the AFM files (but it is a good idea to
store them anyway).
.
.LI
Register all fonts which must be downloaded to the printer in the
`devps/download' file.
.
Only the first occurrence of this file in the font path is read.
.
This means that you should copy the default `download' file to the
first directory in your font path and add your fonts there.
.
To continue the above example we assume that the PS font name for
Foo-Bar-Bold.pfa is `XY-Foo-Bar-Bold' (the PS font name is stored in the
.B internalname
field in the `FBB' file), thus the following line should be added to
`download'.
.
.RS
.IP
.B XY-Foo-Bar-Bold Foo-Bar-Bold.pfa
.
.RE
.
.
.SH OLD FONTS
.
groff versions 1.19.2 and earlier contain a slightly different set of
the 35 Adobe core fonts; the difference is mainly the lack of the `Euro'
glyph and a reduced set of kerning pairs.
.
For backwards compatibility, these old fonts are installed also in the
.
.IP
.BR c:/progra~1/groff/share/groff/1.20.1/oldfont/devps
.
.LP
directory.
.
.LP
To use them, make sure that
.B grops
finds the fonts before the default system fonts (with the same names):
Either add command line option
.B \-F
to
.B grops
.
.IP
.B groff \-Tps \-P\-F \-Pc:/progra~1/groff/share/groff/1.20.1/oldfont .\|.\|.
.
.LP
or add the directory to groff's font path environment variable
.
.IP
.B GROFF_FONT_PATH=c:/progra~1/groff/share/groff/1.20.1/oldfont
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
