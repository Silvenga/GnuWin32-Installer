.SH NAME

pamtouil - convert a PNM or PNM/alpha image into a Motif UIL icon file

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpamtouil\fP [\fB-name=\fP\fIuilname\fP] [\fIpamfile\fP]
.PP
You may abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix.
You may use two hyphens instead of one to delimit an option.  You may
separate an option from its value with whitespace instead of \fB=\fP.

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpamtouil\fP reads a PNM or PAM image as input and produces a
Motif UIL icon file as output.  If the input is PAM, it may be either
a regular grayscale or color image or grayscale+alpha or color+alpha.
Where the alpha channel is present, \fBpamtouil\fP renders pixels
that are more than half transparent as transparent in the output.
.PP
In the UIL's colormap, \fBpamtouil\fP uses the color names from
the RGB database -- the same one
.BR ppmmake (1)
uses.  Where a color in the input does not exactly match one of the colors
named in the RGB database, \fBpamtouil\fP uses the closest color named
in the RGB database.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-name\fP
     Allows you to specify the prefix string which is printed in the
     resulting UIL output.  If not specified, will default to the filename
     (without extension) of the ppmfile argument.  If \fB-name\fP is not
     specified and no ppmfile is specified (i.e. piped input), the
     prefix string will default to the string 'noname'.

.SH HISTORY

way to specify transparency.
