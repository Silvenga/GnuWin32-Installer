.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpalmtopnm\fP reads a Palm Bitmap as input, from Standard Input or
\fIpalmfile\fP and produces a PPM image as output.
.PP
Alternatively (when you specify \fB-transparent\fP),
\fBpalmtopnm\fP writes the value of the transparent color in the Palm
Bitmap to Standard Output.
.PP
\fBPalmtopnm\fP can convert Palm Bitmaps with the following features.
This does not mean that it doesn't handle other features.  These are just
the ones we found worth mentioning.

.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Display various interesting information about the input file and process.

.TP
\fB-transparent\fP
If the Palm Bitmap has a transparent color set, 
\fBpalmtopnm\fP writes the value for that
color to Standard Output in the form #RRGGBB, where
RR, GG, and BB are two-digit hexadecimal numbers
indicating a value in the range 0 through 255.  If no transparent color is set
in the Bitmap, \fBpalmtopnm\fP writes nothing.  \fBpalmtopnm\fP does not
generate any output image when you specify \fB-transparent\fP.

.TP
\fB-rendition N\fP
Palm Bitmaps may contain several different renditions of the same
image, with different depths.  By default, \fBpalmtopnm \fP operates
on the first rendition (rendition number 1) in the image.  This
switch allows you to operate on a different rendition.  The value must
be between 1 and the number of renditions in the image, inclusive.

.TP
\fB-showhist\fP
This option causes \fBpalmtopnm\fP to 
write a histogram of colors in the input file to Standard Error.

.UN limitations
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
You cannot generate an alpha mask if the Palm Bitmap has a
transparent color.  However, you can still do this with
\fBppmcolormask\fP with a Netpbm pipe similar to:
.PP
\fBpalmtopnm bitmap.palm | 
ppmcolormask `palmtopnm -transparent bitmap.palm`\fP

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
Before Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004), there was a \fB-forceplain\fP
option.  But that had been redundant for a long time, since the Netpbm 
common option \fB-plain\fP does the same thing.

This program was originally written as Tbmptopnm.c, by Ian Goldberg.
It was heavily modified by Bill Janssen to add color, compression, and
transparency function.
