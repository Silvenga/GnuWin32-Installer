.SH NAME

pgmtexture - calculate textural features on a PGM image

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpgmtexture\fP

[\fB-d\fP \fId\fP]

[\fIpgmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpgmtexture\fP reads a PGM image as input and calculates
textural features based on spatial dependence matrices at 0, 45, 90,
and 135 degrees for a distance \fId\fP (default = 1).
.PP
Textural features include:


.IP \(bu
Angular Second Moment
.IP \(bu
Contrast
.IP \(bu
Correlation
.IP \(bu
Variance
.IP \(bu
Inverse Difference Moment
.IP \(bu
Sum Average
.IP \(bu
Sum Variance
.IP \(bu
Sum Entropy
.IP \(bu
Entropy
.IP \(bu
Difference Variance
.IP \(bu
Difference Entropy
.IP \(bu
Information Measures of Correlation
.IP \(bu
Maximal Correlation Coefficient

.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
The program can run incredibly slow for large images (larger than
64 x 64) and command line options are limited.  The method for finding
the Maximal Correlation Coefficient, which requires finding the second
largest eigenvalue of a matrix Q, does not always converge.
