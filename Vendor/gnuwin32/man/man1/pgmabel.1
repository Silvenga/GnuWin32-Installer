.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpgmabel\fP reads as input a PGM image, which it assumes to be an
image of a rotational symmetric transparent object.  The image must have
a vertical symmetry axis.  \fBpgmabel\fP produces as output an image of
a cross-section of the image.

\fBpgmabel\fP does the calculation by performing the Abel Integration
for Deconvolution of an axial-symmetrical image by solving the system
of linear equations.

After integration, \fBpgmabel\fP weights all gray-values of one side
by the surface area of the calculated ring in square pixels divided by
4*\fIfactor\fP multiplied by the size of one pixel (\fIpixsize\fP).
With the \fB-verbose\fP option, \fBpgmabel\fP prints the weighting
factors.
.PP
Where the caculation generates a negative result, the output is black.
.PP
The computation is unstable against periodic structures with size 2 in
the vertical direction.

.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-help\fP
Prints a help message.

.TP
\fB-axis\fP \fIaxis\fP
Position of the axis of symmetry in the image in pixels from the left
edge of the image.  Default is the center of the image.

.TP
\fB-factor\fP \fIfactor\fP
User defined factor for enhancement of the output.  Use a \fIfactor\fP
less than 1 for decreasing gary values.  Default is 1.0.

.TP
\fB-pixsize\fP \fIpixsize\fP
The size of a pixel for getting scale invariant.  Default is 0.1.

.TP
\fB-left\fP
Calculate only the left side of the image.  You cannot specify both
\fBleft\fP and \fBright\fP.

.TP
\fB-right\fP
Analogous to \fB-left\fP.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
print information about the calculation.



.UN example
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Rotate a PGM image to get an image with a vertical axis of symmetry,
then calculate the cross section:

.nf
    pnmrotate 90 file.pgm | pgmabel -axis 140 >cross_section.pgm
.fi
