.SH DESCRIPTION
pbmtoibm23xx is part of the Netpbm package.
Netpbm documentation is kept in HTML format.

Please refer to <http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc//pbmtoibm23xx.html>.

If that doesn't work, also try <http://netpbm.sourceforge.net> and
emailing Bryan Henderson, bryanh@giraffe-data.com.

a choice of the person who installed Netpbm on this system.
