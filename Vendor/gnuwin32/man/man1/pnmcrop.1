.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpnmcrop\fP reads a PBM, PGM, or PPM image as input, removes
borders that are the background color, and produces the same type of
image as output.
.PP
If you don't specify otherwise, \fBpnmcrop\fP assumes the
background color is whatever color the top left and right corners of
the image are and if they are different colors, something midway
between them.  You can specify that the background is white or black
with the \fB-white\fP and \fB-black\fP options or make
\fBpnmcrop\fP base its guess on all four corners instead of just two
with \fB-sides\fP.
.PP
By default, \fBpnmcrop\fP chops off any stripe of background color
it finds, on all four sides.  You can tell \fBpnmcrop\fP to remove
only specific borders with the \fB-left\fP, \fB-right\fP,
\fB-top\fP, and \fB-bottom\fP options.
.PP
If you want to chop a specific amount off the side of an image, use
\fBpamcut\fP.
.PP
If you want to add different borders after removing the existing
ones, use \fBpnmcat\fP or \fBpamcomp\fP.

.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-white\fP
Take white to be the background color.  \fBpnmcrop\fP removes
borders which are white.

.TP
\fB-black\fP
Take black to be the background color.  \fBpnmcrop \fP removes
borders which are black.

.TP
\fB-sides\fP
Determine the background color from the colors of the four corners
of the input image.  \fBpnmcrop\fP removes borders which are of the
background color.
.sp
If at least three of the four corners are the same color,
\fBpnmcrop \fP takes that as the background color.  If not,
\fBpnmcrop\fP looks for two corners of the same color in the
following order, taking the first found as the background color: top,
left, right, bottom.  If all four corners are different colors,
\fBpnmcrop\fP assumes an average of the four colors as the background
color.
.sp
The \fB-sides\fP option slows \fBpnmcrop\fP down, as it reads the
entire image to determine the background color in addition to the up
to three times that it would read it without \fB-sides\fP.

.TP
\fB-left\fP
Remove any left border.

.TP
\fB-right\fP
Remove any right border.

.TP
\fB-top\fP
Remove any top border.

.TP
\fB-bottom\fP
Remove any bottom border.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Print on Standard Error information about the processing,
including exactly how much is being cropped off of which sides.
