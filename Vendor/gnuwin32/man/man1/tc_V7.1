.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tc
interprets its
input (standard input default)
as device codes for a Graphic Systems phototypesetter (cat).
The standard output of
.I tc
is intended for a Tektronix 4015 (a 4014 teminal
with ASCII and APL character sets).
The sixteen typesetter sizes are mapped into the 4014's
four sizes;
the entire TROFF character set is drawn using the 4014's
character generator,
using overstruck combinations where necessary.
Typical usage:
