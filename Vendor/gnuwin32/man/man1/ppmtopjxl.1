.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmtopjxl\fP reads a PPM image as input and produces a PCL file
suitable for printing on an HP PaintJet XL printer as output.
.PP
The generated file is not suitable for printing on a normal
PrintJet printer.  The \fB-nopack\fP option generates a file which
does not use the normal TIFF 4.0 compression method. This file might
be printable on a normal PaintJet printer (not an XL).
.PP
The \fB-gamma\fP option sets the gamma correction for the
image. The useful range for the PaintJet XL is approximately 0.6 to
1.5.
.PP
You an alter the rendering algorithm used for images with the
\fB-dither,\fP \fB-cluster,\fP and \fB-diffuse\fP options.  These
options select ordered dithering, clustered ordered dithering, or
error diffusion respectively.  You can use the \fB-dark\fP option to
enhance images with a dark background when they are reduced in size.
The \fB-presentation\fP option turns on presentation mode, in which
two passes are made over the paper to increase ink density.  You
should use this only for images where quality is critical.
.PP
You can resize the image by setting the \fB-xsize\fP and
\fB-ysize\fP options.  The parameter to either of these options is
interpreted as the number of dots to set the width or height to, but
you may append an optional dimension of `\fBpt\fP' (points),
`\fBdp\fP' (decipoints), `\fBin\fP' (inches), or `\fBcm\fP'
(centimetres).  If you specify only one dimension, \fBppmtopjxl\fP
will scale the other one appropriately.
.PP
The options \fB-width\fP and \fB-height\fP are synonyms of
\fB-xsize\fP and \fB-ysize.\fP
.PP
You can alternatively use the \fB-xscale\fP and \fB-yscale\fP
options to scale the image by a simple factor.
.PP
You can shift the image on the page with the \fB-xshift\fP and
\fB-yshift\fP options.  These move the image the specified dimensions
right and down.
