.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The \fB-1x2\fP and \fB-2x4\fP flags give you two alternate ways for
the pixels to get mapped to characters.  With \fB1x2\fP, the default,
each character represents a group of 1 pixel across by 2 pixels down.
With \fB-2x4\fP, each character represents 2 pixels across by 4
pixels down.  With the 1x2 mode you can see the individual pixels, so
it's useful for previewing small images on a non-graphics terminal.
The 2x4 mode lets you display larger images on a standard 80-column
display, but it obscures pixel-level details.  2x4 mode is also good
for displaying PGM images:

.nf
pamscale -width 158 | pnmnorm | pamditherbw -threshold
.fi

should give good results.
