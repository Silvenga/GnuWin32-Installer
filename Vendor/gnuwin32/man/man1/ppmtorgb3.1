.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmtorgb3\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmtorgb3\fP reads a PPM image as input and writes three PGM
images as output, one each for red, green, and blue.
.PP
\fBppmtorgb3\fP constructs the output filenames by taking the
input filename, stripping off any extension, and appending
\fB.red\fP, \fB.grn\fP, \fB.blu\fP.  For example, separating
\fBlenna.ppm\fP would result in \fBlenna.red\fP, \fBlenna.grn\fP,
and \fBlenna.blu\fP.  If the input comes from stdin, the names are
\fBnoname.red\fP, \fBnoname.grn\fP, and \fBnoname.blu\fP.
