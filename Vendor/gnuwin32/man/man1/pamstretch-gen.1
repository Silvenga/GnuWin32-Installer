.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).

\fBpamstretch-gen\fP is a program which uses
.BR pamstretch (1),
.BR pnmfile (1), and
.BR pamscale (1) to smoothly scale up a PNM file
by any ratio; it's like a more general version of pamstretch (hence
the name). But other than the `any ratio' bit, it's much the same as
pamstretch. :-)


.UN lbAE
.SH LIMITATIONS

The program uses \fBawk\fP just to make some simple floating-point
calculations, which is probably overkill.  But using \fBdc\fP makes
my head hurt.
