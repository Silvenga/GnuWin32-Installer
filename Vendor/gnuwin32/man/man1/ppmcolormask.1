.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmcolormask\fP reads a PPM file as input and produces a PBM
(bitmap) file as output.  The output file is the same dimensions as
the input file and is black in all places where the input file is the
color \fIcolor\fP, and white everywhere else.
.PP
The output of \fBppmcolormask\fP is useful as an alpha mask input
to \fBpamcomp\fP.  Note that you can generate such an alpha mask
automatically as you convert to PNG format with
.BR pnmtopng (1).  Use its \fB-transparent\fP
option.
.PP
\fIppmfile\fP is the input file.  If you don't specify
\fIppmfile\fP, the input is from Standard Input.
.PP
The output goes to Standard Output.
.PP
Specify the color (\fIcolor\fP) as described for the 
.UR libppm.html#colorname
argument of the \fBppm_parsecolor()\fP library routine
