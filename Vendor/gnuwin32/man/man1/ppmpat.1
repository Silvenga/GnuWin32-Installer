.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmpat\fP produces a PPM of the specified width and height,
with a pattern in it.
.PP
This program is mainly to demonstrate use of the ppmdraw routines,
a simple but powerful drawing library.  See the ppmdraw.h include file
for more info on using these routines.  Still, some of the patterns
can be rather pretty.  If you have a color workstation, something like
\fBppmpat -squig 300 300 | pnmquant 128\fP
should generate a nice background.
.PP
Some of these patterns have large numbers of colors, so if you want
a simpler pattern, use \fBpnmquant\fP on the output.
