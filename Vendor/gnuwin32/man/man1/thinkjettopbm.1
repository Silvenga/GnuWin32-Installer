[\fIthinkjet_file\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBthinkjettopbm\fP reads HP ThinkJet printer commands from the
standard input, or \fIthinkjet_file\fP if specified, and writes a PBM
image to Standard Output.  
.PP
\fBthinkjettopbm\fP silently ignores
text and non-graphics command sequences.
.PP
The \fB-d\fP option turns on debugging messages which are written
to the standard error stream.

.UN lbAE
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
The program handles only a small subset of ThinkJet command
sequences, but enough to convert screen images from older HP test
equipment.
