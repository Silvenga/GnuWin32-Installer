\fBtgatoppm\fP reads a TrueVision Targa file as input and produces
a PPM image as output.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB--alphaout=\fP\fIalpha-filename\fP
\fBtgatoppm \fP creates a PGM image containing the alpha channel
values in the input image.  If the input image doesn't contain an
alpha channel, the \fIalpha-filename\fP file contains all zero
(transparent) alpha values.  If you don't specify \fB--alphaout\fP,
\fBtgatoppm\fP does not generate an alpha file, and if the input
image has an alpha channel, \fBtgatoppm\fP simply discards it.
.sp
If you specify \fB-\fP as the filename, \fBtgatoppm\fP writes the
alpha output to Standard Output and discards the image.
.sp
See
.BR pamcomp (1) for one way to use
the alpha output file.

.TP
\fB--headerdump\fP
Causes \fBtgatoppm\fP to dump information from the TGA header to
Standard Error.
