.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpnmscale\fP was obsoleted by
.BR \fBpamscale\fP (1), introduced with Netpbm 10.20
(January 2004).  \fBpamscale\fP is backward compatible with
\fBpnmscale\fP, plus adds many additional functions, including the
ability to process PAM images, and tends to produce better results.
.PP
\fBpnmscale\fP remains in the current Netpbm package because it
probably has fewer bugs for now than \fBpamscale\fP, and may have
superior performance characteristics in some cases.  Some day,
\fBpnmscale\fP will probably become an alias for \fBpamscale\fP.
.PP
You can use the \fBpamscale\fP documentation for \fBpnmscale\fP,
considering the following differences:


.IP \(bu
\fBpnmscale\fP options are a subset of \fBpamscale\fP's, as
     documented above.
.IP \(bu
\fBpnmscale\fP always assumes the input is linear, as \fBpamscale\fP
     does when you specify its \fB-linear\fP option.
.IP \(bu
\fBpnmscale\fP cannot process PAM images.
