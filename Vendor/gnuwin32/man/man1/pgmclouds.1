.SH DESCRIPTION \"{{{
pgmclouds generates a picture which looks like a cloudy sky.  The algorithm
first paints the corner pixels, which may have very different gray scales.
In subsequent steps, pixels in between are painted by using an average of
neighbour pixels plus/minus a random value, which interval is the smaller
the nearer the pixels are to each other.
