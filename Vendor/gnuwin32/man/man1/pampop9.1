.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpampop9\fP tiles your starting image \fIxtiles\fP by \fIytiles\fP
times.
Each of these tiles is taken from a slightly different offset within the
source, as determined by the \fIxdelta\fP and \fIydelta\fP arguments.

.PP
The top line of tiles in the output is taken from the top of the source
image, the second starts with the \fIydelta\fP row of the source image,
the next with the 2*\fIydelta\fP row, and so on.
Similarly, the first column of tiles in the output is taken from the left
of the source image, the next starts with the \fIxdelta\fP column, the
next with the 2*\fIxdelta\fP column, and so on.


.UN examples
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
With a 100 x 100 source image, then the output image from
\fBpampop9\fP \fI3 3 10 10\fP will appear to be a three-by-three grid,
each tile being 80 x 80 pixels.
If the origin is taken to be the top-left corner, then the top row of
tiles will take start at (0, 0) (10, 0) (20, 0) within the source image,
the middle row will start at (0, 10) (10, 10) (20, 10), and the bottom
row at (0, 20) (10, 20) (20, 20).


.UN history
.SH HISTORY
