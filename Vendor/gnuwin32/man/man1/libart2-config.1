.TP
\fB--prefix=PREFIX\fR
If specified, use \fIPREFIX\fR instead
of the installation prefix that
\fIlibart\fR was built with when computing
the output for the \fB--cflags\fR and
\fB--libs\fR options. This option is also used for
the exec prefix if \fB--exec-prefix\fR was
not specified. This option must be specified before any
\fB--libs\fR or \fB--cflags\fR options.
.TP
\fB--exec-prefix=PREFIX\fR
If specified, use \fIPREFIX\fR instead
of the installation exec prefix that
\fIlibart\fR was built with when computing
the output for the \fB--cflags\fR and
\fB--libs\fR options. This option must be specified
before any \fB--libs\fR or \fB--cflags\fR options.
.TP
\fB--libs\fR
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a
\fIlibart\fR program.
.TP
