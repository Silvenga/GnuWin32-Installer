ppmtv - make a PPM image look like taken from an American TV

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fIdimfactor\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmtv\fP reads a PPM image as input and dims every other row of
image data down by the specified dim factor.  This factor may be in
the range of 0.0 (the alternate lines are totally black) to 1.0
(original image).
.PP
This creates an effect similar to what I've once seen in the video
clip 'You could be mine' by Guns'n'Roses.  In the scene I'm talking
about you can see John Connor on his motorbike, looking up from the
water trench (?)  he's standing in.  While the camera pulls back, the
image gets 'normal' by brightening up the alternate rows of it. I
thought this would be an interesting effect to try in MPEG. I did not
yet check this out, however.  Try for yourself.
