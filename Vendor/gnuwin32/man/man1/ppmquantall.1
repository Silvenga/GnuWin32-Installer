.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmquantall\fP takes a bunch of PPM images as input, chooses
\fIncolors\fP colors to best represent all of the images, maps the
existing colors to the new ones, and \fBoverwrites the input
files\fP with the new quantized versions.
.PP
If you don't want to overwrite your input files, use the
\fB-ext\fP option.  The output files are then named the same as the
input files, plus a period and the extension text you specify.
.PP
Verbose explanation: Let's say you've got a dozen PPMs that you
want to display on the screen all at the same time.  Your screen can
only display 256 different colors, but the PPMs have a total of a
thousand or so different colors.  For a single PPM you solve this
problem with \fBpnmquant\fP; \fBppmquantall\fP solves it for
multiple PPMs.  All it does is concatenate them together into one big
PPM, run \fBpnmquant\fP on that, and then split it up into little
PPMs again.
.PP
(Note that another way to solve this problem is to pre-select a set
of colors and then use \fBpnmremap\fP to separately quantize each PPM
to that set.)
