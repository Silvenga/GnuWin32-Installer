.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
This program converts Netpbm image files into Utah RLE image files.
You can include an alpha mask.  If the input is a multiple image file,
the output consists of several concatenated RLE images.
.PP
The RLE file will contain either a three channel color image (24
bits) or a single channel grayscale image (8 bits) depending upon the
pnm file depth.  If a converted ppm is displayed on an 8 bit display,
the image must be dithered.  In order to produce a better looking
image (on 8 bit displays), it is recommended that the image be
quantizing (to 8 bit mapped color) prior to its display.  This may be
done by piping the output of this program into the Utah \fBmcut\fP or
\fBrlequant\fP utilities.  We show an example of this later.

.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-v\fP
This option will cause \fBpnmtorle\fP to operate in verbose mode.  The header
information is written to 'stderr'.  Actually, there is not much header
information stored in a Netpbm file, so this information is minimal.
.TP
\fB-h\fP
This option allows the header of the Netpbm image to be dumped to 'stderr'
without converting the file.  It is equivalent to using the -v option except
that no file conversion takes place.
.TP
\fB-a\fP
This option causes \fBpnmtorle\fP to include an alpha channel in the output
image.  The alpha channel is based on the image:  Wherever a pixel 
is black, the corresponding alpha value is transparent.  Everywhere
else, the alpha value is fully opaque.

.TP
\fB-o\fP \fIoutfile\fP
If you specify this option, \fBpnmtorle\fP writes the output to
this file.  If \fIoutfile\fP is \fB-\fP or you don't specify
\fB-o\fP, \fBpnmtorle\fP writes the output to Standard Output.

.TP
\fIpnmfile\fP
The name of the Netpbm image data file to be converted.  If not specified,
standard input is assumed.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
   pnmtorle -v file.ppm -o file.rle
.fi
.PP
While running in verbose mode, convert file.ppm to RLE format and store
resulting data in file.rle.

.nf
   pnmtorle -h file.pgm
.fi
.PP
Dump the header information of the Netpbm file called file.pgm.
