.SH DESCRIPTION

This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpbmtobbnbg\fP reads a portable bitmap as input and produces BBN
BitGraph terminal Display Pixel Data (DPD) sequence as output.
.PP
The rasterop can be specified on the command line.  If this is omitted, 3
(replace) will be used.  A position in (x,y) coordinates can also be
specified.  If both are given, the rasterop comes first.  The portable bitmap
is always taken from the standard input.
