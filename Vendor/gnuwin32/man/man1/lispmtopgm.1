.SH NAME
lispmtopgm - convert a Lisp Machine bitmap file to PGM

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlispmtopgm\fP
[\fIlispmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBlistpmfile\fP reads a Lisp Machine bitmap as input and
produces a PGM image as output.
.PP
This is the file format written by the tv:write-bit-array-file
function on TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp machines.
.PP
Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the Lispm image
file format does not include a color map, so we must treat it as a
monochrome instead and produce PGM.  This is unfortunate.

.SH LIMITATIONS

The Lispm bitmap file format is a bit quirky;  Usually the image in the file
has its width rounded up to the next higher multiple of 32, but not always.
If the width is not a multiple of 32, we don't deal with it properly, but 
because of the Lispm microcode, such arrays are probably not image data 
anyway.
.PP
Also, the Lispm code for saving bitmaps has a bug, in that if you
are writing a bitmap which is not mod32 across, the file may be up to
7 bits too short!  They round down instead of up, and we don't handle
this bug gracefully.
