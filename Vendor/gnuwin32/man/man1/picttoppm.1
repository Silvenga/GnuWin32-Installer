.SH NAME

picttoppm - convert a Macintosh PICT file into a portable pixmap

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpicttoppm\fP

[\fB-fullres\fP]

[\fB-noheader\fP]

[\fB-quickdraw\fP]

[\fB-fontdir\fPfile\fB]\fP

[\fIpictfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpicttoppm\fP reads a PICT file (version 1 or 2) and outputs a PPM
image.
.PP
This is useful as the first step in converting a scanned image to
something that can be displayed on Unix.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-fontdir \fP\fIfile\fP
Make the list of BDF fonts in ``file'' available for use by
\fIpicttoppm\fP when drawing text.  See below for the format of the
fontdir file.

.TP
\fB-fullres\fP
Force any images in the PICT file to be output with at least their
full resolution.  A PICT file may indicate that a contained
image is to be scaled down before output.  This option forces images
to retain their sizes and prevent information loss.
Use of this option disables all PICT operations except images.

.TP
\fB-noheader\fP
Do not skip the 512 byte header that is present on all PICT files.
This is useful when you have PICT data that was not stored in
the data fork of a PICT file.

.TP
\fB-quickdraw\fP
Execute only pure quickdraw operations.  In particular, turn off
the interpretation of special PostScript printer operations.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Turns on verbose mode which prints a a whole bunch of information
that only \fIpicttoppm\fP hackers really care about.



.UN lbAF
.SH LIMITATIONS

The PICT file format is a general drawing format.  \fIpicttoppm\fP
does not recognize all the drawing commands, but it does fully
implement all image commands and mostly implement line, rectangle,
polgon and text drawing.  It is useful for converting scanned images
and some drawing conversion.
.PP
Memory is used very liberally with at least 6 bytes needed for
every pixel.  Large bitmap PICT files will likely run your computer
out of memory.

.UN lbAG
.SH FONT DIR FILE FORMAT
.PP
\fIpicttoppm\fP has a built in default font and your local
installer probably provided adequate extra fonts.  You can point
\fIpicttoppm\fP at more fonts which you specify in a font directory
file.  Each line in the file is either a comment line which must begin
with ``#'' or font information.  The font information consists of 4
whitespace spearated fields.  The first is the font number, the second
is the font size in pixels, the third is the font style and the fourth
is the name of a BDF file containing the font.  The BDF format is
defined by the X window system and is not described here.
.PP
The font number indicates the type face.  Here is a list of known
font numbers and their faces.

.nf
0       Chicago
1       application font
2       New York
3       Geneva
4       Monaco
5       Venice
6       London
7       Athens
8       San Franciso
9       Toronto
11      Cairo
12      Los Angeles
20      Times Roman
21      Helvetica
22      Courier
23      Symbol
24      Taliesin
.fi
.PP
The font style indicates a variation on the font.  Multiple
variations may apply to a font and the font style is the sum of the
variation numbers which are:

.nf
1       Boldface
2       Italic
4       Underlined
8       Outlined
16      Shadow
32      Condensed
64      Extended
.fi
.PP
Obviously the font defintions are strongly related to the
Macintosh.  More font numbers and information about fonts can be found
in Macintosh documentation.
