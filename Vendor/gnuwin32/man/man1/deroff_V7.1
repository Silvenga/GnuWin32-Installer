.TH DEROFF 1 
.SH NAME
deroff \- remove nroff, troff, tbl and eqn constructs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B deroff
[
.B \-w
]
file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Deroff
reads each file in sequence
and removes all
.I nroff
and
.I troff
command lines, backslash constructions, macro definitions,
.I eqn
constructs
(between `.EQ' and `.EN' lines or between 
delimiters),
and table descriptions
and writes the remainder on the standard output.
.I Deroff
follows chains of included files
(`.so' and `.nx' commands);
if a file has already been included, a `.so' is ignored and a `.nx' terminates execution.
If no input file is given,
.I deroff
reads from the standard input file.
.PP
If the
.B \-w
flag is given, the output is a word list, one `word' (string of letters, digits, and apostrophes,
beginning with a letter; apostrophes are removed) per line, and all other characters ignored.
Otherwise, the output follows the original, with the deletions mentioned above.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
troff(1), eqn(1), tbl(1)
.SH BUGS
.I Deroff
is not a complete
.I troff
interpreter,
so it can be confused by subtle constructs.
Most errors result in too much rather than too little output.
