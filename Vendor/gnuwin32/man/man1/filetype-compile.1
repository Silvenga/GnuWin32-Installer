.TH filetype-compile 1 "April 5, 2004"
.SH NAME
filetype-compile
\- compile list of file types for use with filetype(1)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B filetype-compile
file_list file_spec
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B filetype-compile
compiles the text file
.I file_list,
which contains specifications about file types to use for the filetype(1) program into a binary database, which is written to
.I file_spec.
Firstly, the program reads in the data from
.I file_list
and counts the number of records. Then it writes the binary database and counts the number of records in there to check if the two numbers match. Because of potential errors due to multiple specfiles,
.I filetype-compile
reads from the binary database and counts the number of records. If all three numbers match, the records are sorted and written one final time. Otherwise an error message is displayed.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/filetype.spec
Default location of the specfile.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
file(1), filetype(1), libfiletype(2).
