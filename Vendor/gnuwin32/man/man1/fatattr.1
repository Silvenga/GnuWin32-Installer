.TH FATATTR "1" "3 January 2005" "fatattr" "H. Peter Anvin"
.SH NAME
fatattr \- Display or change attributes on a FAT filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fatattr
[\fI+-rhsvda67\fP] \fIfiles\fP...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B fatattr
displays or changes attributes on an MS-DOS FAT filesystem.  If only a
list of diles (or directories) are given, it displays the attributes
for those files or directories.  If given a list of attributes, it
will add (+) or remove (-) the specified attributes from the given
list of files or directories.
.PP
The attributes are:
.TP
.B r
File or directory is readonly.
.TP
.B h
File or directory is hidden.
.TP
.B s
File or directory is used by the system in a nonstandard way.
Standard defragmentation software will avoid this file.  Microsoft
operating systems will treat any file or directory with the system
attribute as hidden, even if the hidden bit is not set.
.TP
.B v
Entry is a volume label.  This bit cannot be changed.
.TP
.B d
Entry is a directory.  This bit cannot be changed.
.TP
.B a
File has been changed.  This bit is set any time a file (but not a
directory) is changed, and is typically cleared by backup software.
.TP
\fB6\fP, \fB7\fP
Unused attributes, set to zero when the file is created and otherwise
unchanged.
.SH BUGS
Requires Linux kernel version 2.6.11 or later.
