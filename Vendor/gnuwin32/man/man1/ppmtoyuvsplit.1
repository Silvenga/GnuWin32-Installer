ppmtoyuvsplit - convert a PPM image to 3 subsampled raw YUV files

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmtoyuvsplit\fP reads a PPM image as input.  Produces 3 raw
files \fIbasename\fP.Y, \fIbasename\fP.U and \fIbasename.V\fP as
output.
.PP
The output files are the subsampled raw YUV representation of the
input PPM image, as required by the Stanford MPEG codec.  The Y output
file contains a byte for each pixel in the image, with the rows going
from top to bottom and the columns within each row going left to
right.  The U and V output files are arranged similarly, except that
each byte represents a square of 4 pixels of the image.  The value is
the arithmetic mean of the value for each of those 4 pixels.  Hence, the
Y file is 4 times the size of the U file or V file.
.PP
The YUV values are scaled according to CCIR.601, as assumed by
MPEG.
