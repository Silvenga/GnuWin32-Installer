.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads an image (binary PPM, binary PGM, JFIF/JPEG) and 
produces a Level 2 PostScript EPS file as output.
.PP
Level 2 PostScript contains support for more efficient encoding of
binary data than the traditional hexadecimal representation.  It also
natively supports of JPEG-compressed image data.  This program takes
advantage of those features to produce PostScript files that are
considerably smaller than those produced with older tools (such as
.I pnmtops
).  The resulting files will print only on PostScript devices
supporting Level 2 features, but Level 2 has been around since 1991 so
virtually all printers today support it.
.PP
The output of this program with no options will be a one-page
PostScript document with the image centered on the page
with one-inch margins.  (The default paper size will be US letter or
A4, depending on options given when the package was built.)  The file
will contain a tight bounding box for the image and other necessary
DSC comments to make the output a legal Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)
file, suitable for inclusion in other documents.
.SH INPUT IMAGES
.PP
For PPM and PGM inputs, only binary (raw format) files are supported,
and maxval is assumed to be 255.  
.PP
If the input is a JFIF file (JPEG File Interchange Format, the format
commonly known as "a JPEG file"), the program will directly encode the
JPEG data as PostScript, without further loss of quality.  Both color
and grayscale JFIFs are supported.  Only
baseline JPEG is supported, since the PostScript standard does not
specify support for progressive JPEG.  If you give
.I imgtops2
a progressive JPEG, it will print a warning message but produce
PostScript output anyway.  Many PostScript devices will choke on this
output, but you're welcome to try it.
.PP
.I rdjpgcom -verbose
can be used to determine the encoding process used for a particular
JFIF file.
.I jpegtran -optimize
will losslessly transcode progressive JPEG into baseline JPEG.  Both
programs are available from the Independent JPEG Group (www.ijg.org).
.PP
For all inputs, the output file should be approximately 25% larger
than the input image file.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The
.B -h
option causes the program to print a summary of the command-line
options to stderr and exit.
.PP
The
.B -o
option causes output to be placed in the given file, rather than sent
to stdout.
.PP
When the 
.B -t
flag is present, the image may be rotated a quarter-turn
counterclockwise on the page, if that allows the image to be scaled larger.
Whether the output is turned or not will depend on the dimensions of
the input image and the size of the printable area on the page.
Without the
.B -t
option, the image will always appear upright.
.PP
Because EPS bounding boxes must be specified with integral
coordinates, it might not be possible to produce a bounding box which
exactly surrounds the image once it is scaled to fit the page.  The
bounding box produced will be conservative:  the program will round so
that the bounding box includes all of the image, but might include
slightly more of the page.  While the width of this extra border will
never exceed 1/72", the 
.B -e
option is provided for the serious purist.  This causes the program to
ignore the page size completely, and place the image upright, starting
at the lower left corner of the page, scaled to one pixel per
PostScript unit.  This file will not be suitable for printing (few
printers can print all the way to the edges of the page, and the image
might be larger than the physical page), but the bounding box will
.I exactly
contain the image.  Files produced with this option should only be
used as EPS input to other programs.
.PP
The printable area on the page can be modified with the
.B -c
and
.B -s
options.  The first sets the lower left corner of the printable area,
relative to the lower left corner of the page.  The second sets 
the width and height of the printable area.  All values are specified
in PostScript units (equal to 1/72" of an inch).  The default is
either US letter size with one inch margins (equivalent to "-c 72,72
-s 468,648") or A4 size with one inch margins (eqivalent to "-c 72,72
-s 451,698"), depending on what option was specified when the package
was built.  Use
.B -h
to see the default.
.PP
The
.B -d
option omits the image from the output file, but draws rectangles
indicating the printable area (red), the image area and orientation
(blue), and the bounding box (green).  This may be useful for
debugging image placement on the page.
