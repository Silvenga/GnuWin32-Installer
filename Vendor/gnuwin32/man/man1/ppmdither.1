.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBppmdither\fP reads a PPM image as input, and applies dithering
to it to reduce the number of colors used down to the specified number
of shades for each primary.  The default number of shades is red=5,
green=9, blue=5, for a total of 225 colors.  To convert the image to a
binary rgb format suitable for color printers, use -red 2 -green 2
-blue 2.
