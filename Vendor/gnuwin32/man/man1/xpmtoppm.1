.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBxpbtoppm\fP reads an X11 pixmap (XPM version 1 or 3) as input
and produces a PPM image as output.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB--alphaout=\fP\fIalpha-filename\fP
\fBxpmtoppm\fP creates a PBM file containing the transparency
mask for the image.  If the input image doesn't contain transparency
information, the \fIalpha-filename\fP file contains all white
(opaque) alpha values.  If you don't specify \fB--alphaout\fP,
\fBxpmtoppm\fP does not generate an alpha file, and if the input
image has transparency information, \fBxpmtoppm\fP simply discards
it.
.sp
If you specify \fB-\fP as the filename, \fBxpmtoppm\fP writes the
alpha output to Standard Output and discards the image.
.sp
See
.BR pamcomp (1) for one way to use
the alpha output file.

.TP
\fB--verbose\fP
\fBxpmtoppm\fP prints information about its processing on Standard Error.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
