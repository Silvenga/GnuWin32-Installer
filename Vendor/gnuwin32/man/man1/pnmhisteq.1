.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpnmhisteq\fP increases the contrast of a portable graymap or
pixmap through the technique of \fIhistogram equalisation\fP[1].
.PP
A histogram of the luminance of pixels in the map is computed, from
which a transfer function is calculated which spreads out intensity levels
around histogram peaks and compresses them at troughs.  This has the
effect of using the available levels of intensity more efficiently and
thereby increases the detail visible in the image.
.PP
Mathematically, if \fIN[i]\fP is the number of pixels of
luminosity \fIi\fP in the image and \fIT\fP is the total number of
pixels, luminosity \fIj\fP is replaced by:

.nf

      j
     ---
     \
      > N[i] / T
     /
     ---
     i=0
.fi
.PP
If you're processing a related set of images, for example frames of
an animation, it's generally best to apply the same intensity map to
every frame, since otherwise you'll get distracting frame-to-frame
changes in the brightness of objects.  \fBpnmhisteq\fP's \fB-wmap\fP
option allows you to save, as a portable graymap, the luminosity map
computed from an image (usually a composite of the images you intend
to process created with \fBpnmcat\fP).  Then, you can subsequently
process each of the individual images using the luminosity map saved
in the file, supplied with the \fB-rmap\fP option.

.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-gray\fP
When processing a pixmap, only gray pixels (those with identical red,
green, and blue values) are included in the histogram and modified
in the output image.  This is a special purpose option intended
for images where the actual data are gray scale, with
color annotations you don't want modified.  Weather
satellite images that show continent outlines in color are best
processed using this option.  The option has no effect when the input
is a graymap.

.TP
\fB-rmap\fP \fImapfile\fP
Process the image using the luminosity map specified by the
PGM file \fImapfile.\fP

The PGM image, usually created by an earlier run of \fBpnmhisteq\fP
with the \fB-wmap\fP option, contains a single row with number of
columns equal to the maxval (greatest intensity value) of the image.  Each
pixel in the image is transformed by looking up its luminosity in the
corresponding column in the map file and changing it to the value
given by that column.

.TP
\fB-wmap\fP\fI mapfile\fP
Creates a PGM file \fImapfile\fP, containing the luminosity map
computed from the histogram of the input image.  This map file can be
read on subsequent runs of \fBpnmhisteq\fP with the \fB-rmap\fP
option, allowing a group of images to be processed with an identical
map.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Prints the histogram and luminosity map on standard error.


.PP
You can abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
Histogram equalisation is effective for increasing the visible
detail in scientific imagery and in some continuous-tone pictures.  It
is often too drastic, however, for scanned halftone images, where it
does an excellent job of making halftone artifacts apparent.  You
might want to experiment with \fBpgnnorm\fP, \fBppmnorm\fP, and
\fBpnmgamma\fP for more subtle contrast enhancement.
.PP
The luminosity map file supplied by the \fB-rmap\fP option must
have the same maxval as the input image.  This is always the case when
the map file was created by the \fB-wmap\fP option of
\fBpnmhisteq\fP.  If this restriction causes a problem, simply adjust
the maxval of the map with \fBpnmdepth\fP to agree with the input
image.
.PP
If the input is a PBM file (on which histogram equalisation is an
identity operation), the only effect of passing the file through
\fBpnmhisteq\fP will be the passage of time.
