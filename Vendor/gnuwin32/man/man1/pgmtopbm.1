.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
This program is obsolete since Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).  Use
.BR \fBpamditherbw\fP (1) to do what this program
used to do.
.PP
\fBpgmtopbm\fP never was the simple converter it appeared to be.
It was a dithering program.  Unfortunately, it didn't do the dithering
properly because it treated the PGM input samples as if they were
directly proportional to light intensity, but they are actually
gamma-adjusted.
.PP
\fBpamditherbw\fP is backward compatible with \fBpgmtopbm\fP
except that it does the correct gamma adjustments.
