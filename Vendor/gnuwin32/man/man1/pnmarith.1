.SH NAME
pnmarith - perform arithmetic on two PNM images

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
Starting with Netpbm 10.3, \fBpnmarith\fP is obsolete.  Use
.BR \fBpamarith\fP (1) instead.

\fBpamarith\fP is backward compatible with \fBpnmarith\fP except where
your input images have different depths.  \fBpnmarith\fP would convert
the one with the lesser depth to have the higher depth before doing the
arithmetic.  With \fBpamarith\fP, you must do that step separately, using
\fBpgmtoppm\fP.
