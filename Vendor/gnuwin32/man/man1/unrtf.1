.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B unrtf
is a converter from Rich Text Format (RTF) to a growing number
of document formats. At present it supports
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), plain text, text with VT100 codes,
LaTeX, and PostScript.
All output formats except HTML are "alpha" i.e. limited and development
has just begun.
However with HTML, the program supports tables, fonts, embedded images,
hyperlinks, and paragraph alignment. Font support includes
face and size changes, as well as 
typical attributes such as italic, bold, 
underlining, strikethrough, smallcaps, allcaps, expand, compress
and both foreground and background colors.
Images are always stored to separate files in the current
directory, or they can be ignored.
