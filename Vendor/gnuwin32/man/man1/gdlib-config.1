.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIgdlib-config\fP is a tool that is used to configure to determine
the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile
and link programs that use the \fIGD\fP library. It is also used internally
to the .m4 macros for GNU autoconf that are included with the \fIGD\fP library.
.
.SH OPTIONS

\fIgdlib-config\fP accepts the following options (and more - run
\fIgdlib-config\fP with no options for the rest):
.TP 8
.B  \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of the \fIGD\fP library on the standard output.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a \fIGD\fP program.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-cflags

.TP 8
.B  \-\-prefix=PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that \fIGD\fP
was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags and
\-\-libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix
if \-\-exec\-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified
before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
.TP 8

\fIGD\fP was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags
and \-\-libs options.  This option must be specified before any
\-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
