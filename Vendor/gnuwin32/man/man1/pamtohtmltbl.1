.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpamtohtmltbl\fP converts a visual image to an HTML table with one
cell per pixel.  The cell is empty, but its background color is that of the
pixel.
.PP
\fIfile\fP is a PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM file.  If PAM, it must be
a standard visual image of tuple type RGB, GRAYSCALE, or BLACKANDWHITE, or
something equivalent with extra higher numbered channels, but
\fBpamtohtmltbl\fP doesn't check the tuple type; it just assumes.
.PP
Note that the more normal way to include a visual image in an HTML
document is with a <IMG> tag.
