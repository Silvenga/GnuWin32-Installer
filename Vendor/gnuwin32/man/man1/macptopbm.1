.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-extraskip\fP
This flag is to get around a problem with some methods of
transferring files from the Mac world to the Unix world.  Most of
these methods leave the Mac files alone, but a few of them add the
\&'finderinfo' data onto the front of the Unix file.  This
means an extra 128 bytes to skip over when reading the file.  The
symptom to watch for is that the resulting PBM file looks shifted to
one side.  If you get this, try \fB-extraskip\fP 128, and if that
still doesn't look right try another value.
