.SH NAME
imgvinfo \- extract and display interesting things from a Pilot Image Viewer pdb header, version 2.0.
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B imgvinfo
.RI [ -h ]
.RI [ -v ]
.RI [ "-t fmt" ]
.RI [ "-{u|l}" ]
.RI [ "in " [ "..." ]]
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBimgvinfo\fR is a simple tool for extracting and displaying a couple things
from a Pilot Image Viewer pdb file; the name, creation time, last modified
time, last backup time, version, type, last position, anchor position,
image size, and the note (if present) are extracted and printed on the
standard output.
.PP
The \fIcreation time\fR and \fImod time\fR are incorrect most of the time;
all of the Image Viewer pdb files that I've come across have
\fI1907-08-16 19:38:22\fR (UTC) here and that makes no sense at all.  However,
if you've created an image pdb with \fBpgmtoimgv\fR(1) or \fBpbmtoimgv\fR(1),
these times will be correct.
.PP
This program was originally written to test some .pdb header parsing code
but it may be a usefull little tool anyway.
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -h
Display a short usage message and exit.
.TP
.I -v
Display the version and exit.
.TP
.I -t fmt
Specify the time format.  The default is "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" (the ISO8601
standard).  See \fBstrftime\fR(3) for the available format codes.
.TP
.I -u
Output times in UTC rather than the local time zone.
.TP
.I -l
Output times in the local time zone (default).
.TP
.I in
The input file.  The standard input is read by default.  A file name of
\fI-\fR means the standard input.
