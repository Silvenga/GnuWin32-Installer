.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).

\fBpnmtopclxl\fP reads one or more PNM input streams, each containing one
or more PNM images, and generates a sequence of output pages in the
HP PCL-XL (formerly named PCL 6) printer control language.  You can send
this stream to a PCL-XL printer to print the images.
.PP
If the input is PPM, the output is a color printer stream (the PCL
color space is RGB).  Otherwise, the output is grayscale (the PCL color space
is grayscale).  If you want a grayscale output from a color input, run your
input through
.BR ppmtopgm (1).  See the 
\fB-colorok\fP option for more information about choosing between color
and grayscale.

.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-o\fP \fIoutfile\fP
This option specifies the name
of the PCL-XL output file.  If you don't specify this, the output goes
to Standard Output.  All of the pages go to one file, concatenated in the
same order as the input images.

.TP
\fB-dpi\fP \fIN\fP
This option selects the resolution of the image (not the printer!).
\fIN\fP is the resolution in dots per inch, from 1 to 65535.  The default
is 300.

.TP
\fB-xoffs\fP \fIN\fP
This option and \fB-yoffs\fP determine the location on the page of the
upper left corner of each image.  Note that the image may have built in
borders tool, which would make the main image within more left and down 
that what you specify here.
.sp
\fB-xoffs\fP and \fB-yoffs\fP specify the distance from the left of the
page and from the top of the page, respectively, in inches, of the upper left
corner of the image.  The default for each is zero.
.sp
These options are meaningless if you specify \fB-center\fP.

.TP
\fB-yoffs\fP \fIN\fP
See \fB-xoffs\fP.

.TP
\fB-center\fP
This option tells \fBpnmtopclxl\fP to center each image on the page.
If you don't specify this option, the position of an image on the page is
determined by \fB-xoffs\fP and \fB-yoffs\fP (or their defaults).

.TP
\fB-duplex\fP {\fBvertical\fP|\fBhorizontal\fP} 
This option
causes \fBpnmtopclxl\fP to create a printer stream that prints pages
on boths sides of the sheet of paper.  \fBvertical\fP means to print
them so that the left edge of both pages is on the same edge of the
sheet, while \fBhorizontal\fP means the more usual duplexing where the
top of both pages is on the same edge of the sheet.

.TP
\fB-format\fP \fIpaperformat\fP
This option selects the media (e.g. paper size) that the printer
control stream specifies.  \fIpaperformat\fP is one of the following
self-explanatory keywords:


.IP \(bu
letter
.IP \(bu
legal
.IP \(bu
a3
.IP \(bu
a4
.IP \(bu

jdoublepostcard

.sp
The default is "letter".

.TP
\fB-feeder\fP \fIN\fP
This options selects the media source (e.g. paper tray) that the
printer control stream specifies.

.TP
\fB-copies\fP \fIN\fP
This option specifies the number of copies that the printer control
stream tells the printer to print.

.TP
\fB-colorok\fP
This option simply tells \fBpnmtopclxl\fP not to warn you if you supply
a color input and therefore get color output.  By default, \fBpnmtopclxl\fP
issues a warning any time it produces a color printer stream because it is
usually a mistake.  It's a mistake because PCL XL is mainly used for laser
printers, and laser printers are mainly black and white.  If you send a color
print stream to a black and white printer, it typically refuses to print
anything, and even if it manages to convert it to black and white and print
it, it takes 3 times as long to transmit a color stream to the printer than
to transmit the grayscale image that gives the same result.
