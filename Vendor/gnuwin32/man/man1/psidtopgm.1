.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpsidtopgm\fP reads the 'image' data from a PostScript
file as input and produces a PGM image as output.
.PP
This program is obsoleted by \fBpstopnm\fP.

What follows was written before \fBpstopnm \fP existed.
.PP
This is a very simple and limited program, and is here only because
so many people have asked for it.  To use it you have to
\fImanually\fP extract the readhexstring data portion from your
PostScript file, and then give the width, height, and bits/sample on
the command line.  Before you attempt this, you should \fIat
least\fP read the description of the 'image' operator in
the PostScript Language Reference Manual.
.PP
It would probably not be too hard to write a script that uses this
filter to read a specific variety of PostScript image, but the
variation is too great to make a general-purpose reader.  Unless, of
course, you want to write a full-fledged PostScript interpreter...
