.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpktopbm\fP reads a packed (PK) font file as input, and produces
PBM images as output. If the filename '-' is used for any of
the filenames, the standard input stream (or standard output where
appropriate) will be used. If either the width or height is specified,
this value will be used for all bitmaps produced. Also if one or both
values are specified, the bitmap will be relocated with the hoffset
and voffset given in the pkfile. The basepoint will be placed in the
lower left corner of the bitmap if the bitmap is bigger than the
specified size it will be truncated at the top or right.
