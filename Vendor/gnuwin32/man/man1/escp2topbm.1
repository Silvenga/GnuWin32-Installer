.SH NAME
escp2topbm - convert an ESC/P2 printer file to a PBM image

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBescp2topbm\fP
[\fIprintfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBescp2topbm\fP reads an ESC/P2 printer control stream as input.
It produces a PBM image as output.
.PP
\fBescp2topbm\fP filters the raster graphic content from an Epson
ESC/P2 printer control stream and writes the image it would print as a
standard (raw) PBM image.
.PP
The input is from the file named by the \fIprintfile\fP argument, or
from Standard Input if you don't specify \fIprintfile\fP.  The output is
to Standard Output.
.PP
\fBescp2topbm\fP understands compression modes 0 (uncompressed)
and 1 (RLE compressed) in the Epson input stream.

.SH HINTS
.PP
As \fBescp2topbm\fP is a simple program, created mainly to test
\fBpbmtoescp2\fP, there are some restrictions:


.IP \(bu
\fBescp2topbm\fP looks only at "ESC." sequences and ignores
all data outside these Escape sequences.

.IP \(bu
\fBescp2topbm\fP assumes that only one raster graphic is in the
printer stream.  If this isn't true, the result is garbage.

.IP \(bu
\fBescp2topbm\fP assumes that all "ESC."  sequences use the same
width value.  If this isn't true, the result is garbage.
