.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpnmtorast\fP
[\fB-standard\fP|\fB-rle\fP]
[\fIpnmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpnmtorast\fPreads a portable pixmap as input and produces a Sun
rasterfile as output.
.PP
Color values in Sun rasterfiles are eight bits wide, so
\fBpnmtorast\fP will automatically scale colors to have a maxval of
255.  An extra \fBpnmdepth\fP step is not necessary.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The \fB-standard\fP option forces the result to be in RT_STANDARD
form; the \fB-rle\fP option, RT_BYTE_ENCODED, which is smaller but,
well, less standard.  The default is \fB-rle\fP.
.PP
All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
