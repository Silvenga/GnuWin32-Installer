.SH NAME
pbmtolps - convert PBM image to PostScript

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmtolps\fP
[\fB-dpi\fP \fIn\fP]
[\fIpbmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpbmtolps\fP reads a PBM image as input and outputs PostScript.
The output Postscript uses lines instead of the image operator to
generate a (device dependent) picture which will be imaged much
faster.
.PP
The Postscript path length is constrained to be less that 1000
points so that no limits are overrun on the Apple Laserwriter and
(presumably) no other printers.
