.TH TCAL 1 "June 14, 2000"
.SH NAME
Tcal \- runs the Gcal program with the date of tomorrow's day.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcal \fI[\fB\-\-help\fI | \fB\-\-version\fI] | [\fB\-\-shift=\fI[\fB+\fI|\fB\-\fI]number] [Argument\&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Tcal
is a program which runs
.B gcal
with a date set one day ahead (equivalent the
.B \-\-shift=\fI1
.ft R
option). All given
.I arguments
are passed unmodified to the Gcal program. If the Gcal program
shall be called with another date than tomorrow's date, this desired
date can be selected by using the
.B \-\-shift=\fI[\fB+\fI|\fB\-\fI]number
.ft R
option, in which [\fB+\fI|\fB\-\fI]number
.ft R
is the distance of days the desired date is distant from the actual
date (works only for Gregorian years). The
.B \-\-shift
option must be given before all other
.I arguments
which are passed to the Gcal program. An exit status of 0 means all
processing is successfully done, any other value means an error has occured.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-help
Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
successfully.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the version number, then exit successfully.
.TP
.B \-\-shift=\fI[\fB+\fI|\fB\-\fI]number
.ft R
Define the displacement in [\fB+\fI|\fB\-\fI]number
.ft R
days the desired date is distant from the actual date.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
GCALPROG
The
.I GCALPROG
environment variable contains the file name of the
executable Gcal program, which is used by
.B Tcal
to call Gcal. This takes precedence over the file name `\fBgcal\fI',
.ft R
which is burned\-in during the compilation step of \fBtcal\fI.
