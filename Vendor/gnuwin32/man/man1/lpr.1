.SH NAME
lpr \- Spool files to a printer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "lpr " [ "\-D" "] [" "\-d"
.I device
.RB "] [" "\-h" "] [" "\-l" "] [" "\-P"
.I device
.RB ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlpr\fP spools a file to the specified printer device. No formatting
is done -- data is sent "raw". This is useful, for example, for sending
Postscript data to a Postscript printer.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-D\fP
enables some debugging output.
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIdevice\fP
specifies the \fIdevice\fP to which to send the output.
.TP
\fB-h\fP
does nothing and is accepted for compatibility only.
.TP
\fB-l\fP
disables CR/LF translation. Normally, files are converted to DOS/Windows-style
line endings (CR+LF) during the spooling process. Some drivers appear to
require this translation, while most don't seem to care. Including this option
on the lpr command line disables any such translations.
.TP
\fB-P\fP \fIdevice\fP
an alias for \fB-d\fP.
.SH DEVICES
A device name may be a UNC path (\\\\server_name\\printer_name), a
reserved DOS device name (e.g., prn, lpt1), or a local port name that
is mapped to a printer share. Note that forward slashes may be used in
a UNC path also (e.g., //server_name/printer_name).
.SH ENVIRONMENT
A default device name may be specified in the \fBPRINTER\fP
environment variable. Specifying a device via a \fB-d\fP or \fB-P\fP
will override the environment variable setting.
.SH NOTES
Make sure that the default paper size setting is correct for the
program that is formatting the page. For example, for enscript, make
sure the \fBDefaultMedia\fP setting is correct in
\fB/etc/enscript.cfg\fP. If this setting is incorrect, it is possible
that no output at all will be produced by the printer. This is
\fBnot\fP an lpr issue.
