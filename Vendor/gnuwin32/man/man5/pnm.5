pnm - Netpbm superformat

.UN lbAC
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
The PNM format is just an abstraction of the PBM, PGM, and PPM
formats.  I.e. the name 'PNM' refers collectively to
PBM, PGM, and PPM.
.PP
The more general term 'Netpbm format' refers to the PNM
formats plus PAM.
.PP
Note that besides being names of formats, PBM, PGM, PPM, and PNM
are also classes of programs.  A PNM program can take PBM, PGM, or PPM
input.  That's nothing special -- a PPM program can too.  But a PNM
program can often produce multiple output formats as well, and a PNM
program can see the difference between PBM, PGM, and PPM input and
respond to each differently whereas a PPM program sees everything as
if it were PPM.  This is discussed more in
.BR the
description of the netpbm programs (1).
.PP
\&'pnm' also appears in the names of the most general
.BR Netpbm library routines (1), some of which aren't even
related to the PNM format.
