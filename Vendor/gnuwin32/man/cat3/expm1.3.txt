EXPM1(3)           Linux Programmer's Manual           EXPM1(3)





NAME
       expm1, expm1f, expm1l  - exponential minus 1

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double expm1(double x);

       float expm1f(float x);

       long double expm1l(long double x);


DESCRIPTION
       expm1(x) returns a value equivalent to `exp (x) - 1'. It
       is computed in a way that is accurate even if the  value
       of  x  is near zero--a case where `exp (x) - 1' would be
       inaccurate due to subtraction of two  numbers  that  are
       nearly equal.

CONFORMING TO
       BSD,  C99.   The  float and the long double variants are
       C99 requirements.
