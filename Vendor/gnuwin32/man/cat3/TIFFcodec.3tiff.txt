CODEC(3TIFF)                                       CODEC(3TIFF)





NAME
       TIFFFindCODEC,  TIFFRegisterCODEC,  TIFFUnRegisterCODEC,
       TIFFIsCODECConfigured - codec-related utility routines

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       const TIFFCodec* TIFFFindCODEC(uint16 scheme);
       TIFFCodec* TIFFRegisterCODEC(uint16 scheme,  const  char
       *method, TIFFInitMethod init);
       void TIFFUnRegisterCODEC(TIFFCodec *codec);
       int TIFFIsCODECConfigured(uint16 scheme);

DESCRIPTION
       libtiff supports a variety of compression schemes imple-
       mented by software codecs.  Each codec adheres to a mod-
       ular interface that provides for the decoding and encod-
       ing of image data; as well as  some  other  methods  for
       initialization,  setup,  cleanup,  and  the  control  of
       default strip and tile sizes.  Codecs are identified  by
       the associated value of the TIFF Compression tag; e.g. 5
       for LZW compression.

       The TIFFRegisterCODEC routine can be used to augment  or
       override  the set of codecs available to an application.
       If the specified scheme already has a  registered  codec
       then  it  is overridden and any images with data encoded
       with this compression scheme will be decoded  using  the
       supplied coded.

       TIFFIsCODECConfigured  returns 1 if the codec is config-
       ured and working. Otherwise 0 will be returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       No space to register compression scheme %s.   TIFFRegis-
       terCODEC  was  unable  to  allocate  memory for the data
       structures needed to register a codec.

       Cannot remove compression  scheme  %s;  not  registered.
       TIFFUnRegisterCODEC  did  not locate the specified codec
       in the table of registered compression schemes.
