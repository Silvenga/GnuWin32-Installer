NAME
       drem,  dremf, dreml, remainder, remainderf, remainderl -
       floating-point remainder function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       /* The C99 versions */
       double remainder(double x, double y);
       float remainderf(float x, float y);
       long double remainderl(long double x, long double y);

       /* Obsolete synonyms */
       double drem(double x, double y);
       float dremf(float x, float y);
       long double dreml(long double x, long double y);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       The  remainder()  function  computes  the  remainder  of
       dividing x by y.  The return value is x - n * y, where n
       is the value x / y, rounded to the nearest integer.   If
       this  quotient is 1/2, it is rounded to the nearest even
       number (independent of the current rounding  mode).   If
       the return value is 0, it has the sign of x.

       The drem() function does precisely the same thing.

RETURN VALUE
       The remainder() function returns the remainder, unless y
       is zero, when the function fails and errno is set.

ERRORS
       EDOM   The denominator y is zero.

CONFORMING TO
       IEC 60559. The three  remainder*()  functions  are  from
       C99.  The function drem() is from BSD 4.3. The float and
       long double variants dremf() and dreml() exist  on  some
       systems, such as Tru64 and glibc2.

EXAMPLE
       The call "remainder(29.0, 3.0)" returns -1.
