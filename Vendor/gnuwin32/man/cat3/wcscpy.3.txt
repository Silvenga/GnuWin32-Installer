NAME
       wcscpy - copy a wide character string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t* wcscpy (wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcscpy function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the strcpy function. It copies the wide character string
       pointed to by src, including the terminating L'\0' char-
       acter, to the array pointed to by dest.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there  is  room  for  at
       least wcslen(src)+1 wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcscpy returns dest.
