NAME
       nextafter,  nextafterf,  nextafterl, nexttoward, nextto-
       wardf, nexttowardl - floating point number manipulation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double nextafter(double x, double y);
       float nextafterf(float x, float y);
       long double nextafterl(long double x, long double y);

       double nexttoward(double x, long double y);
       float nexttowardf(float x, long double y);
       long double nexttowardl(long double x, long double y);

DESCRIPTION
       The nextafter() functions return the next  representable
       neighbor  of  x in the direction towards y.  The size of
       the step between x and the result depends on the type of
       the result.  If x = y the function simply returns y.  If
       either value is NaN, then NaN is returned.  Otherwise  a
       value  corresponding  to the value of the least signifi-
       cant bit in the mantissa is added or subtracted, depend-
       ing on the direction.

       The   nexttoward()   functions   do   the  same  as  the
       nextafter() functions, except that they have a long dou-
       ble second argument.

       These functions will signal overflow or underflow if the
       result goes outside of the range of normalized  numbers.

CONFORMING TO
       C99. This function is defined in IEC 559 (and the appen-
       dix with recommended functions in IEEE 754/IEEE 854).
