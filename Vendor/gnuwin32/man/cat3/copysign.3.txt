COPYSIGN(3)        Linux Programmer's Manual        COPYSIGN(3)





NAME
       copysign, copysignf, copysignl - copy sign of a number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double copysign(double x, double y);
       float copysignf(float x, float y);
       long double copysignl(long double x, long double y);

DESCRIPTION
       The  copysign()  functions return a value whose absolute
       value matches that of x, but whose sign matches that  of
       y.   If  x  is  a  NaN, then a NaN with the sign of y is
       returned.

NOTES
       The copysign() functions may treat a  negative  zero  as
       positive.

CONFORMING TO
       C99,  BSD 4.3.  This function is defined in IEC 559 (and
       the appendix with recommended functions in IEEE 754/IEEE
       854).
