RLE_ADDHIST(3)                                   RLE_ADDHIST(3)





NAME
       rle_addhist - add a history comment to an RLE file.


SYNOPSIS
       #include <rle.h>

       void  rle_addhist( argv, in_hdr, out_hdr )
       char **argv;
       rle_hdr *in_hdr, *out_hdr;


DESCRIPTION
       rle_addhist  is  used  to  add  history  comments to the
       RLE(5) file in the form:
            HISTORY=cmd arg1 arg2 on Tue Sep  13  01:06:49  WST
       1988
       where  cmd,  arg1,  etc.  are the command line arguments
       which have been used to  generate  or  filter  this  RLE
       file.  The HISTORY comment is always appended to so that
       an accumulated history is kept along with  a  timestamp.
       Programs   which   generate   RLE   files   should  call
       rle_addhist as follows:
            rle_addhist(argv,(rle_hdr *)0,&out_hdr);
       Programs which filter RLE files should call  rle_addhist
       as:
            rle_addhist(argv,&in_hdr,&out_hdr);
