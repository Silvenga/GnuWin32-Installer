NAME
       wcsnlen  -  determine  the  length of a fixed-size wide-
       character string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t wcsnlen (const wchar_t* s, size_t maxlen);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsnlen function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the  strnlen  function.  It  returns the number of wide-
       characters in the string pointed to by s, not  including
       the  terminating L'\0' character, but at most maxlen. In
       doing this, wcsnlen looks only at the first maxlen wide-
       characters at s and never beyond s+maxlen.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcsnlen function returns wcslen(s), if that is less
       than maxlen, or maxlen if there is  no  L'\0'  character
       among  the first maxlen wide characters pointed to by s.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.
