DESCRIPTION
       The  following  routines return status information about
       an open TIFF file.

       TIFFCurrentDirectory returns the index  of  the  current
       directory (directories are numbered starting at 0). This
       number is suitable for  use  with  the  TIFFSetDirectory
       routine.

       TIFFLastDirectory  returns  a non-zero value if the cur-
       rent directory is the last directory in the file; other-
       wise zero is returned.

       TIFFCurrentRow,  TIFFCurrentStrip,  and TIFFCurrentTile,
       return the current row, strip, and  tile,  respectively,
       that  is being read or written. These values are updated
       each time a read or write is done.

       TIFFFileno returns the underlying file  descriptor  used
       to access the TIFF image in the filesystem.

       TIFFFileName  returns  the  pathname  argument passed to
       TIFFOpen or TIFFFdOpen.

       TIFFGetMode returns the mode with which  the  underlying
       file  was  opened.  On  UNIX  systems, this is the value
       passed to the open(2) system call.

       TIFFIsTiled returns a non-zero value if the  image  data
       has  a tiled organization. Zero is returned if the image
       data is organized in strips.

       TIFFIsByteSwapped returns a non-zero value if the  image
       data  was  in  a  different  byte-order  than  the  host
       machine. Zero is returned if the  TIFF  file  and  local
       host  byte-orders  are  the  same.   Note that TIFFRead-
       Tile(), TIFFReadStrip() and TIFFReadScanline() functions
       already  normally  perform  byte  swapping to local host
       order if needed.

       TIFFIsUpSampled returns a non-zero value if  image  data
       returned  through  the  read interface routines is being
       up-sampled. This can be useful to applications that want
       to  calculate  I/O  buffer  sizes  to reflect this usage
       (though the usual strip and tile size  routines  already
       do this).

       TIFFIsMSB2LSB returns a non-zero value if the image data
       is being returned with bit 0  as  the  most  significant
       bit.

       TIFFGetVersion  returns  an ASCII string that has a ver-
       sion stamp for the TIFF library software.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None.
