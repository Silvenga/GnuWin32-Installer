NAME
       iswgraph - test for graphic wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswgraph (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswgraph  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the isgraph function. It tests whether wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "graph".

       The wide character class "graph" is a  subclass  of  the
       wide character class "print".

       Being  a  subclass  of the wide character class "print",
       the wide character class "graph" is  disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "cntrl".

       The  wide  character  class "graph" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "space" and therefore also disjoint
       from its subclass "blank".

       The  wide  character class "graph" contains all the wide
       characters from the wide character class "print"  except
       the  space  character.  It  therefore  contains the wide
       character classes "alnum" and "punct".

RETURN VALUE
       The iswgraph function returns non-zero if wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "graph".
       Otherwise it returns zero.

NOTES
       The behaviour of iswgraph depends on the LC_CTYPE  cate-
       gory of the current locale.
