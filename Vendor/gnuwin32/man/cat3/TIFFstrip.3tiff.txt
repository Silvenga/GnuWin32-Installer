TIFFSTRIP(3TIFF)                               TIFFSTRIP(3TIFF)





NAME
       TIFFDefaultStripSize,   TIFFStripSize,   TIFFVStripSize,
       TIFFRawStripSize, TIFFComputeStrip, TIFFNumberOfStrips -
       strip-related utility routines

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       uint32 TIFFDefaultStripSize(TIFF *tif, uint32 estimate)
       tsize_t TIFFStripSize(TIFF *tif)
       tsize_t TIFFVStripSize(TIFF *tif, uint32 nrows)
       tsize_t TIFFRawStripSize(TIFF *tif, tstrip_t strip)
       tstrip_t  TIFFComputeStrip(TIFF  *tif, uint32 row, tsam-
       ple_t sample)
       tstrip_t TIFFNumberOfStrips(TIFF *tif)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFDefaultStripSize returns the number of  rows  for  a
       reasonable-sized strip according to the current settings
       of the ImageWidth, BitsPerSample, SamplesPerPixel,  tags
       and  any compression-specific requirements. If the esti-
       mate parameter, if non-zero, then  it  is  taken  as  an
       estimate  of the desired strip size and adjusted accord-
       ing to any compression-specific requirements. The  value
       returned  by  this  function is typically used to define
       the RowsPerStrip tag. In lieu of  any  unusual  require-
       ments  TIFFDefaultStripSize  tries to create strips that
       have approximately 8 kilobytes of uncompressed data.

       TIFFStripSize returns the equivalent size for a strip of
       data as it would be returned in a call to TIFFReadEncod-
       edStrip or  as  it  would  be  expected  in  a  call  to
       TIFFWriteEncodedStrip.

       TIFFVStripSize  returns  the  number of bytes in a strip
       with nrows rows of data.

       TIFFRawStripSize returns the number of bytes  in  a  raw
       strip (i.e. not decoded).

       TIFFComputeStrip  returns  the  strip  that contains the
       specified coordinates. A valid strip is always returned;
       out-of-range coordinate values are clamped to the bounds
       of the image. The row parameter is always used in calcu-
       lating  a  strip.  The  sample parameter is used only if
       data are organized in separate planes  (PlanarConfigura-
       tion=2).

       TIFFNumberOfStrips  returns  the number of strips in the
       image.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None.
