NAME
       TIFFReadRGBATile  - read and decode an image tile into a
       fixed-format raster

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       #define TIFFGetR(abgr)   ((abgr) & 0xff)
       #define TIFFGetG(abgr)   (((abgr) >> 8) & 0xff)
       #define TIFFGetB(abgr)   (((abgr) >> 16) & 0xff)
       #define TIFFGetA(abgr)   (((abgr) >> 24) & 0xff)

       int TIFFReadRGBATile(TIFF  *tif,  uint32  x,  uint32  y,
       uint32 *raster)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFReadRGBATile  reads  a  single  tile of a tile-based
       image into memory, storing the result in the  user  sup-
       plied RGBA raster.  The raster is assumed to be an array
       of width times length 32-bit entries, where width is the
       width  of  a  tile (TIFFTAG_TILEWIDTH) and length is the
       height of a tile (TIFFTAG_TILELENGTH).


       The x and y values are the offsets  from  the  top  left
       corner  to  the  top left corner of the tile to be read.
       They must be an exact multiple of  the  tile  width  and
       length.


       Note that the raster is assume to be organized such that
       the pixel at location (x,y) is  raster[y*width+x];  with
       the  raster  origin in the lower-left hand corner of the
       tile. That is bottom to top  organization.   Edge  tiles
       which  partly fall off the image will be filled out with
       appropriate zeroed areas.


       Raster pixels are 8-bit packed red, green,  blue,  alpha
       samples.  The  macros  TIFFGetR, TIFFGetG, TIFFGetB, and
       TIFFGetA should be used to  access  individual  samples.
       Images without Associated Alpha matting information have
       a constant Alpha of 1.0 (255).

       See the TIFFRGBAImage(3TIFF) page for  more  details  on
       how various image types are converted to RGBA values.

NOTES
       Samples  must  be either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits. Colori-
       metric samples/pixel must be either 1,  3,  or  4  (i.e.
       SamplesPerPixel minus ExtraSamples).

       Palette  image  colormaps  that appear to be incorrectly
       written as 8-bit  values  are  automatically  scaled  to
       16-bits.

       TIFFReadRGBATile  is just a wrapper around the more gen-
       eral TIFFRGBAImage(3TIFF) facilities.  It's main  advan-
       tage  over  the  similar TIFFReadRGBAImage() function is
       that for large images a single buffer capable of holding
       the  whole  image  doesn't  need  to  be allocated, only
       enough for one tile.  The  TIFFReadRGBAStrip()  function
       does a similar operation for stripped images.

RETURN VALUES
       1  is  returned  if  the image was successfully read and
       converted.  Otherwise, 0 is returned  if  an  error  was
       encountered.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All  error messages are directed to the TIFFError(3TIFF)
       routine.

       Sorry, can not handle %d-bit pictures.   The  image  had
       BitsPerSample other than 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.

       Sorry,  can not handle %d-channel images.  The image had
       SamplesPerPixel other than 1, 3, or 4.

       Missing  needed  "PhotometricInterpretation"  tag.   The
       image  did  not have a tag that describes how to display
       the data.

       No "PhotometricInterpretation" tag, assuming  RGB.   The
       image  was  missing  a tag that describes how to display
       it, but because it has  3  or  4  samples/pixel,  it  is
       assumed to be RGB.

       No  "PhotometricInterpretation"  tag,  assuming  min-is-
       black.  The image was missing a tag that  describes  how
       to  display it, but because it has 1 sample/pixel, it is
       assumed to be a grayscale or bilevel image.

       No space for photometric conversion  table.   There  was
       insufficient  memory  for  a table used to convert image
       samples to 8-bit RGB.

       Missing required "Colormap" tag.  A  Palette  image  did
       not have a required Colormap tag.

       No space for tile buffer.  There was insufficient memory
       to allocate an i/o buffer.

       No space for strip buffer.  There was insufficient  mem-
       ory to allocate an i/o buffer.

       Can not handle format.  The image has a format (combina-
       tion  of  BitsPerSample,  SamplesPerPixel,  and   Photo-
       metricInterpretation)  that  TIFFReadRGBAImage  can  not
       handle.

       No space for B&W mapping table.  There was  insufficient
       memory to allocate a table used to map grayscale data to
       RGB.

       No space for Palette mapping table.  There was  insuffi-
       cient  memory  to  allocate  a table used to map data to
       8-bit RGB.
