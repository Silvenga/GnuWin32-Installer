NAME
       iswalnum - test for alphanumeric wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswalnum (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswalnum  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the isalnum function. It tests whether wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "alnum".

       The wide character class "alnum" is a  subclass  of  the
       wide  character class "graph", and therefore also a sub-
       class of the wide character class "print".

       Being a subclass of the wide  character  class  "print",
       the  wide  character  class "alnum" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "cntrl".

       Being a subclass of the wide  character  class  "graph",
       the  wide  character  class "alnum" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "space" and its subclass "blank".

       The wide character class "alnum" is  disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "punct".

       The  wide  character  class  "alnum" is the union of the
       wide character classes "alpha" and "digit". As such,  it
       also contains the wide character class "xdigit".

       The  wide  character  class  "alnum"  always contains at
       least the letters 'A' to 'Z', 'a' to 'z' and the  digits
       '0' to '9'.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswalnum  function returns non-zero if wc is a wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "alnum".
       Otherwise it returns zero.

NOTES
       The  behaviour of iswalnum depends on the LC_CTYPE cate-
       gory of the current locale.
