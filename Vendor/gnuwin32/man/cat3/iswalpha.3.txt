NAME
       iswalpha - test for alphabetic wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswalpha (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswalpha  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the isalpha function. It tests whether wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "alpha".

       The wide character class "alpha" is a  subclass  of  the
       wide  character class "alnum", and therefore also a sub-
       class of the wide character class  "graph"  and  of  the
       wide character class "print".

       Being  a  subclass  of the wide character class "print",
       the wide character class "alpha" is  disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "cntrl".

       Being  a  subclass  of the wide character class "graph",
       the wide character class "alpha" is  disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "space" and its subclass "blank".

       Being  a  subclass  of the wide character class "alnum",
       the wide character class "alpha" is  disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "punct".

       The  wide  character  class "alpha" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "digit".

       The wide character class "alpha" contains the wide char-
       acter classes "upper" and "lower".

       The  wide  character  class  "alpha"  always contains at
       least the letters 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z'.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswalpha function returns non-zero if wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "alpha".
       Otherwise it returns zero.

NOTES
       The behaviour of iswalpha depends on the LC_CTYPE  cate-
       gory of the current locale.
