NAME
       wcscspn  -  search  a wide-character string for any of a
       set of wide characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t wcscspn (const wchar_t* wcs, const wchar_t* reject);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcscspn function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the  strcspn  function.  It determines the length of the
       longest initial segment of wcs which  consists  entirely
       of wide-characters not listed in reject. In other words,
       it searches for the first occurrence in the wide-charac-
       ter  string  wcs  of  any of the characters in the wide-
       character string reject.

RETURN VALUE
       The wcscspn function returns the number of wide  charac-
       ters  in  the  longest initial segment of wcs which con-
       sists entirely of wide-characters not listed in  reject.
       In  other  words,  it  returns the position of the first
       occurrence in the wide-character string wcs  of  any  of
       the  characters  in the wide-character string reject, or
       wcslen(wcs) if there is none.
