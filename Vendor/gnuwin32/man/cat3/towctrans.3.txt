NAME
       towctrans - wide-character transliteration

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wint_t towctrans (wint_t wc, wctrans_t desc);

DESCRIPTION
       If wc is a wide character, the towctrans function trans-
       lates it according  to  the  transliteration  descriptor
       desc. If wc is WEOF, WEOF is returned.

       desc  must  be  a transliteration descriptor returned by
       the wctrans function.

RETURN VALUE
       The towctrans function returns the translated wide char-
       acter, or WEOF if wc is WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

SEE ALSO
       wctrans(3), towlower(3), towupper(3)

NOTES
       The behaviour of towctrans depends on the LC_CTYPE cate-
       gory of the current locale.
