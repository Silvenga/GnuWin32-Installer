NAME
       wcpncpy  -  copy a fixed-size string of wide characters,
       returning a pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t* wcpncpy (wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcpncpy function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the  stpncpy  function. It copies at most n wide charac-
       ters from the wide-character string pointed to  by  src,
       including  the terminating L'\0' character, to the array
       pointed to by dest. Exactly n wide characters are  writ-
       ten  at  dest. If the length wcslen(src) is smaller than
       n, the remaining wide characters in the array pointed to
       by  dest are filled with L'\0' characters. If the length
       wcslen(src) is greater or equal to n, the string pointed
       to by dest will not be L'\0' terminated.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The  programmer  must  ensure  that there is room for at
       least n wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcpncpy returns a pointer to  the  last  wide  character
       written, i.e.  dest + n - 1.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.
