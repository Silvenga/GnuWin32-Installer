GETWCHAR(3)        Linux Programmer's Manual        GETWCHAR(3)





NAME
       getwchar - read a wide character from standard input

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t getwchar (void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  getwchar  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the getchar function. It reads a wide character  from
       stdin  and  returns it. If the end of stream is reached,
       or if ferror(stdin) becomes true, it returns WEOF. If  a
       wide character conversion error occurs, it sets errno to
       EILSEQ and returns WEOF.

RETURN VALUE
       The getwchar function returns  the  next  wide-character
       from standard input, or WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

SEE ALSO
       fgetwc(3)

NOTES
       The  behaviour of getwchar depends on the LC_CTYPE cate-
       gory of the current locale.

       It is reasonable to expect that getwchar  will  actually
       read  a  multibyte sequence from standard input and then
       convert it to a wide character.
