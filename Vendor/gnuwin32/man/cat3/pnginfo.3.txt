PNGINFO(3)                                           PNGINFO(3)





NAME
       pnginfo - display information on the PNG files named

SYNOPSIS
        pnginfo [-t] [-d] [-D] <filenames>

DESCRIPTION
       This command dumps information about the PNG files named
       on the command line. This command's output is  based  on
       the  output  of the <command>tiffinfo</command> command,
       which is part of the <command>libtiff</command>  distri-
       bution.  Each  line  output  by the command represents a
       value that has been set within the  PNG  file.   </para>
       <para>  The  <command>-t</command>  command  line option
       forces pnginfo to use <emphasis>libtiff</emphasis> <com-
       mand>tiffinfo</command>  style  lables,  instead  of the
       more relevant png names. The <command>-d</command>  com-
       mand line option dumps the bitmap contained by the image
       to standard out, whilst the  <command>-D</command>  com-
       mand  merely  checks  that  the  image  bitmap  could be
       extracted from the file. If nothing is reported by <com-
       mand>-D</command>,  then  there  was  no error.  </para>
       <para> The format for the output bitmaps is hexadecimal,
       with  each  pixel  presented as a triple -- for instance
       [red green blue]. This means  that  paletted  images  et
       cetera  will have their bitmaps expanded before display.

RETURNS
       Nothing
