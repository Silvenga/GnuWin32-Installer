WCSNCAT(3)         Linux Programmer's Manual         WCSNCAT(3)





NAME
       wcsncat - concatenate two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t* wcsncat (wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsncat function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the strncat function. It copies at most n  wide  charac-
       ters from the wide-character string pointed to by src to
       the end of the wide-character string pointed to by dest,
       and adds a terminating L'\0' character.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The  programmer  must  ensure  that there is room for at
       least wcslen(dest)+n+1 wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcsncat returns dest.
