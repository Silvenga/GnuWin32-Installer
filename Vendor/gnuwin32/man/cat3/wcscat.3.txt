NAME
       wcscat - concatenate two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t* wcscat (wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcscat function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the strcat function. It copies the wide-character string
       pointed to by src, including the terminating L'\0' char-
       acter, to the end of the wide-character  string  pointed
       to by dest.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The  programmer  must  ensure  that there is room for at
       least  wcslen(dest)+wcslen(src)+1  wide  characters   at
       dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcscat returns dest.
