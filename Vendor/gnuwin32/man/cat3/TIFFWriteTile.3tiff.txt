NAME
       TIFFWriteTile  -  encode  and write a tile of data to an
       open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFWriteTile(TIFF *tif, tdata_t buf, uint32  x,
       uint32 y, uint32 z, tsample_t sample)

DESCRIPTION
       Write  the  data  for  the tile containing the specified
       coordinates. The data in buf are is  (potentially)  com-
       pressed,  and  written  to  the indicated file, normally
       being appended to the end of the file. The  buffer  must
       be  contain  an entire tile of data. Applications should
       call the routine TIFFTileSize to find out the  size  (in
       bytes)  of  a  tile  buffer.  The x and y parameters are
       always used by TIFFWriteTile.  The z parameter  is  used
       if the image is deeper than 1 slice (ImageDepth>1).  The
       sample parameter is used only if data are  organized  in
       separate planes (PlanarConfiguration=2).

RETURN VALUES
       TIFFWriteTile  returns -1 if it detects an error; other-
       wise the number of bytes in the tile is returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the  TIFFError(3TIFF)
       routine.
