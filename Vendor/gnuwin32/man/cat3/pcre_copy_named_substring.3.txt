NAME
       PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre.h>

       int pcre_copy_named_substring(const pcre *code,
            const char *subject, int *ovector,
            int stringcount, const char *stringname,
            char *buffer, int buffersize);

DESCRIPTION

       This is a convenience function for extracting a captured
       substring, identified by name, into a given buffer.  The
       arguments are:

         code          Pattern that was successfully matched
         subject         Subject  that  has  been  successfully
       matched
         ovector       Offset vector that pcre_exec() used
         stringcount   Value returned by pcre_exec()
         stringname    Name of the required substring
         buffer        Buffer to receive the string
         buffersize    Size of buffer

       The   yield   is   the   length   of   the    substring,
       PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY  if  the  buffer  was  too small, or
       PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING if the string name is invalid.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE  native  API
       in  the  pcreapi page and a description of the POSIX API
       in the pcreposix page.
