WCSCMP(3)          Linux Programmer's Manual          WCSCMP(3)





NAME
       wcscmp - compare two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcscmp (const wchar_t* s1, const wchar_t* s2);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcscmp function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the strcmp  function.  It  compares  the  wide-character
       string  pointed  to  by s1 and the wide-character string
       pointed to by s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The wcscmp function returns zero if  the  wide-character
       strings  at  s1  and s2 are equal. It returns an integer
       greater than zero if at the first differing position  i,
       the  corresponding  wide-character s1[i] is greater than
       s2[i]. It returns an integer less than zero  if  at  the
       first differing position i, the corresponding wide-char-
       acter s1[i] is less than s2[i].
