NAME
       TIFFWriteRawStrip - write a strip of raw data to an open
       TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t  TIFFWriteRawStrip(TIFF  *tif,  tstrip_t  strip,
       tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Append size bytes of raw data to the specified strip.

NOTES
       The  strip number must be valid according to the current
       settings of the ImageLength and RowsPerStrip  tags.   An
       image  may  be dynamically grown by increasing the value
       of ImageLength prior to each call to  TIFFWriteRawStrip.

RETURN VALUES
       -1  is  returned  if  an error occurred.  Otherwise, the
       value of size is returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the  TIFFError(3TIFF)
       routine.

       %s:  File not open for writing.  The file was opened for
       reading, not writing.

       Can not write scanlines to a tiled image. The  image  is
       assumed  to  be organized in tiles because the TileWidth
       and  TileLength  tags  have  been  set   with   TIFFSet-
       Field(3TIFF).

       %s:  Must  set  "ImageWidth"  before  writing data.  The
       image's width has not be set  before  the  first  write.
       See  TIFFSetField(3TIFF)  for  information  on how to do
       this.

       %s: Must set "PlanarConfiguration" before writing  data.
       The  organization  of data has not be defined before the
       first write.  See TIFFSetField(3TIFF) for information on
       how to do this.

       %s:  No  space  for strip arrays".  There was not enough
       space for the arrays that hold strip  offsets  and  byte
       counts.

       %s:  Strip %d out of range, max %d.  The specified strip
       is not a valid strip according to the  currently  speci-
       fied image dimensions.
