NAME
       iswblank - test for whitespace wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswblank (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswblank  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the isblank function. It tests whether wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "blank".

       The wide character class "blank" is a  subclass  of  the
       wide character class "space".

       Being  a  subclass  of the wide character class "space",
       the wide character class "blank" is  disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "graph" and therefore also disjoint
       from its subclasses "alnum", "alpha", "upper",  "lower",
       "digit", "xdigit", "punct".

       The  wide  character  class  "blank"  always contains at
       least the space  character  and  the  control  character
       '\t'.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswblank  function returns non-zero if wc is a wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "blank".
       Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.

NOTES
       The  behaviour of iswblank depends on the LC_CTYPE cate-
       gory of the current locale.
