PUTWCHAR(3)        Linux Programmer's Manual        PUTWCHAR(3)





NAME
       putwchar - write a wide character to standard output

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t putwchar (wchar_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  putwchar  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the putchar function. It writes the wide character wc
       to  stdout.   If ferror(stdout) becomes true, it returns
       WEOF. If a wide character conversion  error  occurs,  it
       sets  errno  to  EILSEQ  and returns WEOF.  Otherwise it
       returns wc.

RETURN VALUE
       The putwchar function returns wc if no  error  occurred,
       or WEOF to indicate an error.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

SEE ALSO
       fputwc(3)

NOTES
       The  behaviour of putwchar depends on the LC_CTYPE cate-
       gory of the current locale.

       It is reasonable to expect that putwchar  will  actually
       write  the  multibyte sequence corresponding to the wide
       character wc.
