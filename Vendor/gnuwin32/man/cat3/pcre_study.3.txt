PCRE_STUDY(3)                                                    PCRE_STUDY(3)



NAME
       PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre.h>

       pcre_extra *pcre_study(const pcre *code, int options,
            const char **errptr);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function  studies  a  compiled  pattern, to see if
       additional information can be extracted that might speed
       up matching. Its arguments are:

         code       A compiled regular expression
         options    Options for pcre_study()
         errptr     Where to put an error message

       If the function succeeds, it returns a value that can be
       passed to pcre_exec() via its extra argument.

       If the function returns NULL, either it could  not  find
       any  additional  information, or there was an error. You
       can tell the difference by looking at the  error  value.
       It is NULL in first case.

       There are currently no options defined; the value of the
       second argument should always be zero.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE  native  API
       in  the  pcreapi page and a description of the POSIX API
       in the pcreposix page.
