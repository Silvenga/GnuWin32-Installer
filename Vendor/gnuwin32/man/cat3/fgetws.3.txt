FGETWS(3)          Linux Programmer's Manual          FGETWS(3)





NAME
       fgetws - read a wide character string from a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t* fgetws (wchar_t* ws, int n, FILE* stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The fgetws function is the wide-character equivalent  of
       the  fgets  function.  It  reads a string of at most n-1
       wide characters into the wide-character array pointed to
       by  ws, and adds a terminating L'\0' character. It stops
       reading wide characters after  it  has  encountered  and
       stored  a newline wide character. It also stops when end
       of stream is reached.

       The programmer must ensure that there  is  room  for  at
       least n wide characters at ws.

RETURN VALUE
       The  fgetws  function, if successful, returns ws. If end
       of stream was already reached or if an  error  occurred,
       it returns NULL.

NOTES
       The behaviour of fgetws depends on the LC_CTYPE category
       of the current locale.

       In the absence of additional information passed  to  the
       fopen  call, it is reasonable to expect that fgetws will
       actually read a multibyte string  from  the  stream  and
       then convert it to a wide character string.

       This  function is unreliable, because it does not permit
       to deal properly with null wide characters that  may  be
       present in the input.
