DESCRIPTION
       TIFFScanlineSize returns the size in bytes of a  row  of
       data  as it would be returned in a call to TIFFReadScan-
       line,  or  as  it  would  be  expected  in  a  call   to
       TIFFWriteScanline.

       complete decoded and packed raster scanline.  Note  that
       this  value  may be different from the value returned by
       TIFFScanlineSize if data is stored as separate planes.
