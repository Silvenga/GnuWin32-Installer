NAME
       TIFFGetBitRevTable,    TIFFReverseBits,   TIFFSwabShort,
       TIFFSwabLong, TIFFSwabArrayOfShort,  TIFFSwabArrayOfLong
       - byte- and bit-swapping routines

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       const unsigned char* TIFFGetBitRevTable(int reversed)
       void TIFFReverseBits(u_char *data, unsigned long nbytes)
       void TIFFSwabShort(uint16 *data)
       void TIFFSwabLong(uint32 *data)
       void TIFFSwabArrayOfShort(uint16  *data,  unsigned  long
       nshorts)
       void  TIFFSwabArrayOfLong(uint32  *data,  unsigned  long
       nlongs)

DESCRIPTION
       The following routines are used by the library  to  swap
       16-  and 32-bit data and to reverse the order of bits in
       bytes.

       TIFFSwabShort and TIFFSwabLong swap the bytes in a  sin-
       gle  16-bit  and 32-bit item, respectively.  TIFFSwabAr-
       rayOfShort and TIFFSwabArrayOfLong swap the bytes in  an
       array of 16-bit and 32-bit items, respectively.

       TIFFReverseBits  replaces  each  byte  in  data with the
       equivalent bit-reversed value. This  operation  is  per-
       formed  with a lookup table, which is returned using the
       TIFFGetBitRevTable function.  reversed parameter  speci-
       fies  which  table  should  be returned. Supply 1 if you
       want bit reversal table. Supply 0 to get the table  that
       do not reverse bit values. It is a lookup table that can
       be  used  as  an  identity  function;  i.e.    TIFFNoBi-
       tRevTable[n] == n.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None.
