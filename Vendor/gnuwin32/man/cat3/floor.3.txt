FLOOR(3)           Linux Programmer's Manual           FLOOR(3)





NAME
       floor,  floorf,  floorl  -  largest  integral  value not
       greater than argument

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double floor(double x);
       float floorf(float x);
       long double floorl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions round x down to the nearest integer.

RETURN VALUE
       The rounded integer value. If x is integral or infinite,
       x itself is returned.

ERRORS
       No errors other than EDOM and ERANGE can occur.  If x is
       NaN, then NaN is returned and errno may be set to  EDOM.

NOTES
       SUSv2  and POSIX 1003.1-2001 contain text about overflow
       (which might set errno to ERANGE,  or  raise  an  excep-
       tion).   In  practice, the result cannot overflow on any
       current machine, so this error-handling  stuff  is  just
       nonsense.   (More  precisely,  overflow  can happen only
       when the maximum value of the exponent is  smaller  than
       the  number of mantissa bits.  For the IEEE-754 standard
       32-bit and 64-bit floating  point  numbers  the  maximum
       value  of the exponent is 128 (resp. 1024), and the num-
       ber of mantissa bits is 24 (resp. 53).)

CONFORMING TO
       The floor() function conforms to SVID 3, POSIX, BSD 4.3,
       ISO 9899.  The other functions are from C99.
