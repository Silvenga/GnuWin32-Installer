NAME
       pngchunkdesc  -  decode  information embedded into a PNG
       chunk name

SYNOPSIS
        pngchunkdesc

DESCRIPTION
       PNGfiles are based around  a  series  of  chunks,  which
       embody  the  information stored in the image file. These
       chunks have four character ASCII names, where  the  case
       of  each  letter stores additional information.  </para>
       <para> This program decodes the case information in  the
       chunk  names,  and  displays it. The program reads chunk
       names from stdin, and write chunk descriptions  to  std-
       out.
