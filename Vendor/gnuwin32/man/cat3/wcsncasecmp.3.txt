NAME
       wcsncasecmp  -  compare  two  fixed-size  wide-character
       strings, ignoring case

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcsncasecmp (const wchar_t* s1, const wchar_t* s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsncasecmp function is the  wide-character  equiva-
       lent  of the strncasecmp function. It compares the wide-
       character string pointed to by s1 and the wide-character
       string  pointed  to by s2, but at most n wide characters
       from each string, ignoring case  differences  (towupper,
       towlower).

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcsncasecmp function returns zero if the wide-char-
       acter strings at s1 and s2, truncated to at most  length
       n,  are equal except for case distinctions. It returns a
       positive integer if truncated s1 is greater  than  trun-
       cated  s2,  ignoring case. It returns a negative integer
       if truncated s1 is smaller than truncated  s2,  ignoring
       case.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.

NOTES
       The  behaviour  of  wcsncasecmp  depends on the LC_CTYPE
       category of the current locale.
