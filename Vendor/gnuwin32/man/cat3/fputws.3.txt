FPUTWS(3)          Linux Programmer's Manual          FPUTWS(3)





NAME
       fputws - write a wide character string to a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int fputws (const wchar_t* ws, FILE* stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fputws function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the fputs function. It writes the wide character  string
       starting  at ws, up to but not including the terminating
       L'\0' character, to stream.

RETURN VALUE
       The fputws function returns a nonnegative integer if the
       operation was successful, or -1 to indicate an error.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

SEE ALSO
       fputwc(3)

NOTES
       The behaviour of fputws depends on the LC_CTYPE category
       of the current locale.

       In the absence of additional information passed  to  the
       fopen  call, it is reasonable to expect that fputws will
       actually write the multibyte string corresponding to the
       wide character string ws.
