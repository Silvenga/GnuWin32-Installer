NAME
       towupper - convert a wide character to uppercase

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wint_t towupper (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  towupper  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the toupper function. If wc is a wide  character,  it
       is  converted to uppercase. Characters which do not have
       case are returned unchanged.  If wc  is  WEOF,  WEOF  is
       returned.

RETURN VALUE
       The  towupper  function returns the uppercase equivalent
       of wc, or WEOF if wc is WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

SEE ALSO
       towlower(3), towctrans(3), iswupper(3)

NOTES
       The behaviour of towupper depends on the LC_CTYPE  cate-
       gory of the current locale.

       This  function  is not very appropriate for dealing with
       Unicode characters, because Unicode  knows  about  three
       cases: upper, lower and title case.
