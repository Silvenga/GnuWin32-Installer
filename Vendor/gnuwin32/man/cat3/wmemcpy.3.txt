WMEMCPY(3)         Linux Programmer's Manual         WMEMCPY(3)





NAME
       wmemcpy - copy an array of wide-characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t* wmemcpy (wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The wmemcpy function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the memcpy function. It copies n  wide  characters  from
       the array starting at src to the array starting at dest.

       The arrays may not  overlap;  use  wmemmove(3)  to  copy
       between overlapping arrays.

       The  programmer  must  ensure  that there is room for at
       least n wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wmemcpy returns dest.
