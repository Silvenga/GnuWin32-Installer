WCSNCMP(3)         Linux Programmer's Manual         WCSNCMP(3)





NAME
       wcsncmp - compare two fixed-size wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcsncmp (const wchar_t* s1, const wchar_t* s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsncmp function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the strncmp function.  It  compares  the  wide-character
       string  pointed  to  by s1 and the wide-character string
       pointed to by s2, but at most  n  wide  characters  from
       each string. In each string, the comparison extends only
       up to the first occurrence of a L'\0' character, if any.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcsncmp function returns zero if the wide-character
       strings at s1 and s2, truncated to at most length n, are
       equal.   It  returns  an integer greater than zero if at
       the first differing position i (i < n), the  correspond-
       ing  wide-character  s1[i]  is  greater  than  s2[i]. It
       returns an integer less than zero if at the  first  dif-
       fering  position i (i < n), the corresponding wide-char-
       acter s1[i] is less than s2[i].
