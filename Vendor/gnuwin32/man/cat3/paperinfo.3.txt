NAME
       paperinfo,    paperwithsize,    paperfirst,   paperlast,
       papernext, paperprev - return informations about a paper

SYNOPSYS
       #include <paper.h>

       const struct paper* paperinfo(const char* papername)
       const struct paper* paperwithsize(double psw, double psh)

       char*  papername(const struct paper*)
       double paperpswidth(const struct paper*)
       double paperpsheigth(const struct paper*)

       const struct paper* paperfirst(void)
       const struct paper* papernext(const struct paper* pinfo)
       const struct paper* paperprev(const struct paper* pinfo)
       const struct paper* paperlast(void)

DESCRIPTION
       paperinfo() returns a pointer to a struct paper contain-
       ing informations about the  paper  with  name  papername
       paperwithsize() looks for a paper whose width and height
       is psw and  psh  in  PostScript  points,  and  return  a
       pointer  to  a  struct  paper corresponding to the paper
       found.

       papername() returns the name of a paper described by  an
       opaque  struct  paper  object paperpswidth() returns the
       width, in PostScript points, of a paper described by  an
       opaque  struct  paper object paperpsheight() returns the
       height, in PostScript points, of a paper described by an
       opaque struct paper object

       paperfirst()  and  paperlast() return the first and last
       entries for papers.  Iteration from  one  entry  to  the
       next  or  the  previous one can be done with papernext()
       and paperprev() respectively.
