NAME
       iswlower - test for lowercase wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswlower (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswlower  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the islower function. It tests whether wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "lower".

       The wide character class "lower" is a  subclass  of  the
       wide  character class "alpha", and therefore also a sub-
       class of the wide character class "alnum", of  the  wide
       character  class "graph" and of the wide character class
       "print".

       Being a subclass of the wide  character  class  "print",
       the  wide  character  class "lower" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "cntrl".

       Being a subclass of the wide  character  class  "graph",
       the  wide  character  class "lower" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "space" and its subclass "blank".

       Being a subclass of the wide  character  class  "alnum",
       the  wide  character  class "lower" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "punct".

       Being a subclass of the wide  character  class  "alpha",
       the  wide  character  class "lower" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "digit".

       The wide character class "lower" contains at least those
       characters  wc  which are equal to towlower(wc) and dif-
       ferent from towupper(wc).

       The wide character  class  "lower"  always  contains  at
       least the letters 'a' to 'z'.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswlower  function returns non-zero if wc is a wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "lower".
       Otherwise it returns zero.

NOTES
       The  behaviour of iswlower depends on the LC_CTYPE cate-
       gory of the current locale.

       This function is not very appropriate for  dealing  with
       Unicode  characters,  because  Unicode knows about three
       cases: upper, lower and title case.
