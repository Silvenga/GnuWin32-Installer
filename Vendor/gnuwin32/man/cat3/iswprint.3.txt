NAME
       iswprint - test for printing wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswprint (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswprint  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the isprint function. It tests whether wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "print".

       The wide character class "print" is  disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "cntrl".

       The wide character class "print" contains the wide char-
       acter class "graph".

RETURN VALUE
       The iswprint function returns non-zero if wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "print".
       Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO

NOTES
       The behaviour of iswprint depends on the LC_CTYPE  cate-
       gory of the current locale.
