NAME
       ungetwc - push back a wide character onto a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t ungetwc (wint_t wc, FILE* stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The ungetwc function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the ungetc function. It pushes  back  a  wide  character
       onto stream and returns it.

       If wc is WEOF, it returns WEOF. If wc is an invalid wide
       character, it sets errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.

       If wc is a valid wide character, it is pushed back  onto
       the  stream  and  thus becomes available for future wide
       character read operations.  The file-position  indicator
       is decremented by one or more. The end-of-file indicator
       is cleared. The backing  storage  of  the  file  is  not
       affected.

       Note:  wc  need not be the last wide character read from
       the stream; it can be any other valid wide character.

       If the implementation supports multiple push-back opera-
       tions  in a row, the pushed-back wide characters will be
       read in reverse order; however, only one level of  push-
       back is guaranteed.

RETURN VALUE
       The ungetwc function returns wc when successful, or WEOF
       upon failure.

CONFORMING TO

NOTES
       The behaviour of ungetwc depends on the  LC_CTYPE  cate-
       gory of the current locale.
