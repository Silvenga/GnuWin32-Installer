TOWLOWER(3)        Linux Programmer's Manual        TOWLOWER(3)





NAME
       towlower - convert a wide character to lowercase

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wint_t towlower (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  towlower  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the tolower function. If wc is a wide  character,  it
       is  converted to lowercase. Characters which do not have
       case are returned unchanged.  If wc  is  WEOF,  WEOF  is
       returned.

RETURN VALUE
       The  towlower  function returns the lowercase equivalent
       of wc, or WEOF if wc is WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

       towupper(3), towctrans(3), iswlower(3)

NOTES
       The behaviour of towlower depends on the LC_CTYPE  cate-
       gory of the current locale.

       This  function  is not very appropriate for dealing with
       Unicode characters, because Unicode  knows  about  three
       cases: upper, lower and title case.
