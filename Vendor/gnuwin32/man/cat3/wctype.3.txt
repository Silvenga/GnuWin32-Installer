WCTYPE(3)          Linux Programmer's Manual          WCTYPE(3)





NAME
       wctype - wide character classification

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wctype_t wctype (const char* name);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wctype_t  type  represents  a property which a wide
       character may or may not have. In other words, it repre-
       sents a class of wide characters.  This type's nature is
       implementation  dependent,   but   the   special   value
       (wctype_t)0   denotes   an   invalid  property.  Nonzero
       wctype_t values can be passed to the  iswctype  function
       to  actually test whether a given wide character has the
       property.

       The wctype function returns a  property,  given  by  its
       name.  The  set  of  valid names depends on the LC_CTYPE
       category of the current locale, but the following  names
       are valid in all locales.
         "alnum" - realizes the isalnum classification function
         "alpha" - realizes the isalpha classification function
         "blank" - realizes the isblank classification function
         "cntrl" - realizes the iscntrl classification function
         "digit" - realizes the isdigit classification function
         "graph" - realizes the isgraph classification function
         "lower" - realizes the islower classification function
         "print" - realizes the isprint classification function
         "punct" - realizes the ispunct classification function
         "space" - realizes the isspace classification function
         "upper" - realizes the isupper classification function
         "xdigit" - realizes the isxdigit classification function

RETURN VALUE
       The wctype function returns a property descriptor if the
       name is valid. Otherwise it returns (wctype_t)0.

NOTES
       The behaviour of wctype depends on the LC_CTYPE category
       of the current locale.
