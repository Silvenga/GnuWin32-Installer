MEMORY(3TIFF)                                     MEMORY(3TIFF)





NAME
       _TIFFmalloc,   _TIFFrealloc,   _TIFFfree,   _TIFFmemset,
       _TIFFmemcpy, _TIFFmemcmp,  -  memory  management-related
       functions for use with TIFF files

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       tdata_t _TIFFmalloc(tsize_t size);
       tdata_t _TIFFrealloc(tdata_t buffer, tsize_t size);
       void _TIFFfree(tdata_t buffer);
       void _TIFFmemset(tdata_t s, int c, tsize_t n);
       void   _TIFFmemcpy(tdata_t   dest,  const  tdata_t  src,
       tsize_t n);
       int _TIFFmemcmp(const  tdata_t  s1,  const  tdata_t  s2,
       tsize_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       These  routines  are provided for writing portable soft-
       ware that uses libtiff; they hide any  memory-management
       related issues, such as dealing with segmented architec-
       tures found on 16-bit machines.

       _TIFFmalloc and _TIFFrealloc  are  used  to  dynamically
       allocate  and reallocate memory used by libtiff; such as
       memory passed into the I/O  routines.  Memory  allocated
       through  these interfaces is released back to the system
       using the _TIFFfree routine.

       Memory allocated through one of the above interfaces can
       be  set  to  a  known value using _TIFFmemset, copied to
       another memory location using _TIFFmemcpy,  or  compared
       for  equality using _TIFFmemcmp.  These routines conform
       to the equivalent ANSI C routines: memset,  memcpy,  and
       memcmp, repsectively.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None.
