WMEMCMP(3)         Linux Programmer's Manual         WMEMCMP(3)





NAME
       wmemcmp - compare two arrays of wide-characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wmemcmp (const wchar_t* s1, const wchar_t* s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The wmemcmp function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the memcmp function. It compares the  n  wide-characters
       starting at s1 and the n wide-characters starting at s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The wmemcmp function returns zero if the  wide-character
       arrays  of  size n at s1 and s2 are equal. It returns an
       integer greater than zero  if  at  the  first  differing
       position  i  (i  <  n), the corresponding wide-character
       s1[i] is greater than s2[i]. It returns an integer  less
       than  zero if at the first differing position i (i < n),
       the corresponding  wide-character  s1[i]  is  less  than
       s2[i].
