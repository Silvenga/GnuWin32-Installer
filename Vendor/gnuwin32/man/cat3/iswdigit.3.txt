NAME
       iswdigit - test for decimal digit wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswdigit (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswdigit  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the isdigit function. It tests whether wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "digit".

       The wide character class "digit" is a  subclass  of  the
       wide character class "xdigit", and therefore also a sub-
       class of the wide character class "alnum", of  the  wide
       character  class "graph" and of the wide character class
       "print".

       Being a subclass of the wide  character  class  "print",
       the  wide  character  class "digit" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "cntrl".

       Being a subclass of the wide  character  class  "graph",
       the  wide  character  class "digit" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "space" and its subclass "blank".

       Being a subclass of the wide  character  class  "alnum",
       the  wide  character  class "digit" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "punct".

       The wide character class "digit" is  disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "alpha" and therefore also disjoint
       from its subclasses "lower", "upper".

       The wide character class "digit" always contains exactly
       the digits '0' to '9'.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswdigit  function returns non-zero if wc is a wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "digit".
       Otherwise it returns zero.

NOTES
       The  behaviour of iswdigit depends on the LC_CTYPE cate-
       gory of the current locale.
