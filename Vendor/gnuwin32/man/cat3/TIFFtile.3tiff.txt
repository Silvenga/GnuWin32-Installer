SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       void  TIFFDefaultTileSize(TIFF  *tif, uint32 *tw, uint32
       *th)
       tsize_t TIFFTileSize(TIFF *tif)
       tsize_t TIFFTileRowSize(TIFF *tif)
       tsize_t TIFFVTileSize(TIFF *tif, uint32 nrows)
       ttile_t TIFFComputeTile(TIFF *tif, uint32 x,  uint32  y,
       uint32 z, tsample_t sample)
       int  TIFFCheckTile(TIFF *tif, uint32 x, uint32 y, uint32
       z, tsample_t sample)
       ttile_t TIFFNumberOfTiles(TIFF *tif)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFDefaultTileSize returns the pixel width  and  height
       of  a reasonable-sized tile; suitable for setting up the
       TileWidth and TileLength tags.  If the tw and th  values
       passed  in  are  non-zero,  then  they  are  adjusted to
       reflect  any  compression-specific   requirements.   The
       returned width and height are constrained to be a multi-
       ple of 16 pixels to conform with the TIFF specification.

       TIFFTileSize  returns  the equivalent size for a tile of
       data as it would be returned in a call  to  TIFFReadTile
       or as it would be expected in a call to TIFFWriteTile.

       TIFFVTileSize  returns  the  number  of  bytes in a row-
       aligned tile with nrows of data.

       TIFFTileRowSize returns the number of bytes of a row  of
       data in a tile.

       TIFFComputeTile returns the tile that contains the spec-
       ified coordinates. A valid tile is always returned; out-
       of-range  coordinate values are clamped to the bounds of
       the image. The x and y parameters  are  always  used  in
       calculating a tile. The z parameter is used if the image
       is deeper  than  1  slice  (ImageDepth>1).   The  sample
       parameter is used only if data are organized in separate
       planes (PlanarConfiguration=2).

       TIFFCheckTile returns a non-zero value if  the  supplied
       coordinates  are within the bounds of the image and zero
       otherwise. The x parameter is checked against the  value
       of  the  ImageWidth  tag.  The  y  parameter  is checked
       against the value of the ImageLength tag. The z  parame-
       ter  is  checked against the value of the ImageDepth tag
       (if defined). The sample parameter  is  checked  against
       the  value  of the SamplesPerPixel parameter if the data
       are organized in separate planes.

       TIFFNumberOfTiles returns the number  of  tiles  in  the
       image.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None.
