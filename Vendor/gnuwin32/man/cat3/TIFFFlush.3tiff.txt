NAME
       TIFFFlush,  TIFFFlushData  -  flush pending writes to an
       open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFFlush(TIFF *tif)
       int TIFFFlushData(TIFF *tif)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFFlush causes any pending writes  for  the  specified
       file  (including writes for the current directory) to be
       done. In normal operation this call is  never  needed  -
       the library automatically does any flushing required.

       TIFFFlushData  flushes  any  pending  image data for the
       specified file to be written out; directory-related data
       are  not flushed. In normal operation this call is never
       needed - the library  automatically  does  any  flushing
       required.

RETURN VALUES
       0 is returned if an error is encountered, otherwise 1 is
       returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the  TIFFError(3TIFF)
       routine.
