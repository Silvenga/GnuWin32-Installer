NAME
       TIFFReadTile  -  read  and decode a tile of data from an
       open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFReadTile(TIFF *tif, tdata_t buf,  uint32  x,
       uint32 y, uint32 z, tsample_t sample)

DESCRIPTION
       Return  the  data  for the tile containing the specified
       coordinates. The data placed in buf are returned  decom-
       pressed  and,  typically,  in  the native byte- and bit-
       ordering, but are otherwise packed (see further  below).
       The  buffer  must be large enough to hold an entire tile
       of data. Applications should call the routine  TIFFTile-
       Size  to  find out the size (in bytes) of a tile buffer.
       The x and y parameters are always used by  TIFFReadTile.
       The  z  parameter  is used if the image is deeper than 1
       slice (ImageDepth>1).  The sample parameter is used only
       if data are organized in separate planes (PlanarConfigu-
       ration=2).

NOTES
       The library attempts to hide bit- and byte-ordering dif-
       ferences  between  the  image  and the native machine by
       converting data to the native machine order.  Bit rever-
       sal  is  done  if  the  FillOrder tag is opposite to the
       native machine bit order. 16-  and  32-bit  samples  are
       automatically  byte-swapped if the file was written with
       a byte order opposite to the native machine byte order,

RETURN VALUES
       TIFFReadTile returns -1 if it detects an  error;  other-
       wise  the  number  of  bytes  in  the  decoded  tile  is
       returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the  TIFFError(3TIFF)
       routine.
