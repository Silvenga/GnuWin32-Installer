TIFFSetDirectory(3TIFF)                 TIFFSetDirectory(3TIFF)





NAME
       TIFFSetDirectory,  TIFFSetSubDirectory - set the current
       directory for an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFSetDirectory(TIFF *tif, tdir_t dirnum)
       int TIFFSetSubDirectory(TIFF *tif, uint32 diroff)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFSetDirectory changes the current directory and reads
       its contents with TIFFReadDirectory.  The parameter dir-
       num specifies the subfile/directory as an  integer  num-
       ber, with the first directory numbered zero.

       TIFFSetSubDirectory  acts  like TIFFSetDirectory, except
       the directory is specified as a file offset  instead  of
       an  index; this is required for accessing subdirectories
       linked through a SubIFD tag.

RETURN VALUES
       On successful return 1  is  returned.  Otherwise,  0  is
       returned  if  dirnum  or diroff specifies a non-existent
       directory, or if an error was encountered while  reading
       the directory's contents.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All  error messages are directed to the TIFFError(3TIFF)
       routine.

       %s:  Error  fetching  directory  count.   An  error  was
       encountered while reading the ``directory count'' field.

       %s: Error fetching directory link.  An error was encoun-
       tered  while  reading  the ``link value'' that points to
       the next directory in a file.
