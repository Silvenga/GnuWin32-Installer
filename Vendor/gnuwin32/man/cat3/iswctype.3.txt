ISWCTYPE(3)        Linux Programmer's Manual        ISWCTYPE(3)





NAME
       iswctype - wide character classification

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswctype (wint_t wc, wctype_t desc);

DESCRIPTION
       If  wc is a wide character having the character property
       designated by desc (or in other words:  belongs  to  the
       character  class designated by desc), the iswctype func-
       tion returns non-zero. Otherwise it returns zero. If  wc
       is WEOF, zero is returned.

       desc must be a character property descriptor returned by
       the wctype function.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswctype function returns non-zero if the wc has the
       designated property. Otherwise it returns 0.

CONFORMING TO

       gory of the current locale.
