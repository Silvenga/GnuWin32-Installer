NAME
       TIFFReadEncodedTile  -  read  and  decode a tile of data
       from an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFReadEncodedTile(TIFF *tif, u_long  tile,  u_char
       *buf, u_long size)

DESCRIPTION
       Read  the  specified  tile  of data and place up to size
       bytes of decompressed information in the (user supplied)
       data buffer.

NOTES
       The  value  of  tile is a ``raw tile number.''  That is,
       the caller must take into account  whether  or  not  the
       data  are organized in separate planes (PlanarConfigura-
       tion=2).  TIFFComputeTile automatically does  this  when
       converting  an  (x,y,z,sample) coordinate quadruple to a
       tile number. To read a full tile of data the data buffer
       should  be  at  least  as large as the value returned by
       TIFFTileSize.

       The library attempts to hide bit- and byte-ordering dif-
       ferences  between  the  image  and the native machine by
       converting data to the native machine order.  Bit rever-
       sal  is  done  if  the  FillOrder tag is opposite to the
       native machine bit order. 16-  and  32-bit  samples  are
       automatically  byte-swapped if the file was written with
       a byte order opposite to the native machine byte order,

RETURN VALUES
       The actual number of bytes of data that were  placed  in
       buf  is  returned;  TIFFReadEncodedTile returns -1 if an
       error was encountered.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the  TIFFError(3TIFF)
       routine.
