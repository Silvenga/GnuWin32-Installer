NAME
       iswspace - test for whitespace wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswspace (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswspace  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the isspace function. It tests whether wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "space".

       The wide character class "space" is  disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "graph" and therefore also disjoint
       from its subclasses "alnum", "alpha", "upper",  "lower",
       "digit", "xdigit", "punct".

       The wide character class "space" contains the wide char-
       acter class "blank".

       The wide character  class  "space"  always  contains  at
       least  the  space  character  and the control characters
       '\f', '\n', '\r', '\t', '\v'.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswspace function returns non-zero if wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "space".
       Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO

NOTES
       The behaviour of iswspace depends on the LC_CTYPE  cate-
       gory of the current locale.
