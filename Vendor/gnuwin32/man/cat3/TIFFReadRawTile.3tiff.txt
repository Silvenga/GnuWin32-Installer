NAME
       TIFFReadRawTile  - return an undecoded tile of data from
       an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFReadRawTile(TIFF *tif, ttile_t tile, tdata_t
       buf, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Read  the  contents of the specified tile into the (user
       supplied) data buffer.  Note that the value of tile is a
       ``raw  tile number.'' That is, the caller must take into
       account whether or not the data is organized in separate
       planes  (PlanarConfiguration=2).   TIFFComputeTile auto-
       matically does this when  converting  an  (x,y,z,sample)
       coordinate  quadruple  to  a tile number. To read a full
       tile of data the data  buffer  should  typically  be  at
       least as large as the value returned by TIFFTileSize.

RETURN VALUES
       The  actual  number of bytes of data that were placed in
       buf is returned; TIFFReadEncodedTile returns  -1  if  an
       error was encountered.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All  error messages are directed to the TIFFError(3TIFF)
       routine.
