RLE_CP(3)                                             RLE_CP(3)





NAME
       rle_cp - Copy the rest of an image to the output.


SYNOPSIS
       #include <rle.h>

       rle_cp( in_hdr, out_hdr )
       rle_hdr *in_hdr, *out_hdr;


DESCRIPTION
       This  routine  copies  the  image contents of one RLE(5)
       file to another.  The image described by in_hdr will  be
       copied  to  the image file described by out_hdr.  If any
       rows have been read with rle_getrow(3) or rle_getraw(3),
       those   rows   must   have   also   been   written  with
       rle_putrow(3) or rle_putraw(3), respectively,  in  order
       for  the input and output files to be "in sync".  In any
       case, the header should have been written to the  output
       file  with  rle_put_setup(3).   When rle_cp returns, the
       input image file will be positioned at the  end  of  the
       image,  and  an end of image code will have been written
       to the output image file.
