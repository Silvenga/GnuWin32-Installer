NAME
       TIFFReadEncodedStrip  -  read and decode a strip of data
       from an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFReadEncodedStrip(TIFF *tif, tstrip_t  strip,
       tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Read  the  specified  strip of data and place up to size
       bytes of decompressed information in the (user supplied)
       data buffer.

NOTES
       The  value of strip is a ``raw strip number.''  That is,
       the caller must take into account  whether  or  not  the
       data  are organized in separate planes (PlanarConfigura-
       tion=2).  To read a full strip of data the  data  buffer
       should  typically  be  at  least  as large as the number
       returned by TIFFStripSize(3TIFF).  If the -1  passed  in
       size parameter, the whole strip will be read. You should
       be sure you have enough space allocated for the  buffer.

       The library attempts to hide bit- and byte-ordering dif-
       ferences between the image and  the  native  machine  by
       converting data to the native machine order.  Bit rever-
       sal is done if the FillOrder  tag  is  opposite  to  the
       native  machine  bit  order.  16- and 32-bit samples are
       automatically byte-swapped if the file was written  with
       a byte order opposite to the native machine byte order,

RETURN VALUES
       The  actual  number of bytes of data that were placed in
       buf is returned; TIFFReadEncodedStrip returns -1  if  an
       error was encountered.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All  error messages are directed to the TIFFError(3TIFF)
       routine.
