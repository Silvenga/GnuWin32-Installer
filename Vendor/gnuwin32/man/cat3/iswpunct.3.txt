NAME
       iswpunct - test for punctuation or symbolic wide charac-
       ter

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswpunct (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The iswpunct function is the  wide-character  equivalent
       of  the  ispunct function. It tests whether wc is a wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "punct".

       The  wide  character  class "punct" is a subclass of the
       wide character class "graph", and therefore also a  sub-
       class of the wide character class "print".

       The  wide  character  class "punct" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "alnum" and therefore also disjoint
       from  its subclasses "alpha", "upper", "lower", "digit",
       "xdigit".

       Being a subclass of the wide  character  class  "print",
       the  wide  character  class "punct" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "cntrl".

       Being a subclass of the wide  character  class  "graph",
       the  wide  character  class "punct" is disjoint from the
       wide character class "space" and its subclass "blank".

RETURN VALUE
       The iswpunct function returns non-zero if wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "punct".
       Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO

SEE ALSO
       ispunct(3), iswctype(3)

NOTES
       The behaviour of iswpunct depends on the LC_CTYPE  cate-
       gory of the current locale.

       This  function's  name  is  a misnomer when dealing with
       Unicode characters, because  the  wide  character  class
       "punct"  contains both punctuation characters and symbol
       (math, currency, etc.) characters.
