NAME
       TIFFWritedEncodedTile  -  compress  and  write a tile of
       data to an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFWriteEncodedTile(TIFF  *tif,  ttile_t  tile,
       tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Compress  size bytes of raw data from buf and append the
       result to the end of the specified tile. Note  that  the
       value  of  tile  is  a ``raw tile number.'' That is, the
       caller must take into account whether or  not  the  data
       are   organized  in  separate  places  (PlanarConfigura-
       tion=2).  TIFFComputeTile automatically does  this  when
       converting  an  (x,y,z,sample) coordinate quadruple to a
       tile number.

NOTES
       The library writes encoded data using the native machine
       byte  order.  Correctly  implemented  TIFF  readers  are
       expected to do any necessary byte-swapping to  correctly
       process image data with BitsPerSample greater than 8.

RETURN VALUES
       -1  is  returned if an error was encountered. Otherwise,
       the value of size is returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the  TIFFError(3TIFF)
       routine.

       %s:  File not open for writing.  The file was opened for
       reading, not writing.

       Can not write tiles to a stripped image.  The  image  is
       assumed to be organized in strips because neither of the
       TileWidth or TileLength tags have been set with TIFFSet-
       Field(3TIFF).

       %s:  Must  set  "ImageWidth"  before  writing  data. The
       image's width has not be set before the first write. See
       TIFFSetField(3TIFF) for information on how to do this.

       %s:  Must set "PlanarConfiguration" before writing data.
       The organization of data has not be defined  before  the
       first  write. See TIFFSetField(3TIFF) for information on
       how to do this.

       %s: No space for tile arrays".   There  was  not  enough
       space  for  the  arrays  that hold tile offsets and byte
       counts.
