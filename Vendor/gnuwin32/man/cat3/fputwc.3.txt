FPUTWC(3)          Linux Programmer's Manual          FPUTWC(3)





NAME
       fputwc - write a wide character to a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t fputwc (wchar_t wc, FILE* stream);
       wint_t putwc (wchar_t wc, FILE* stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fputwc function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the fputc function. It writes the wide character  wc  to
       stream. If ferror(stream) becomes true, it returns WEOF.
       If a wide character conversion  error  occurs,  it  sets
       errno  to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.  Otherwise it returns
       wc.

       The putwc function  or  macro  performs  identically  to
       fputwc.

RETURN VALUE
       The  fputwc function returns wc if no error occurred, or
       WEOF to indicate an error.

CONFORMING TO

NOTES
       The behaviour of fputwc depends on the LC_CTYPE category
       of the current locale.

       In  the  absence of additional information passed to the
       fopen call, it is reasonable to expect that fputwc  will
       actually  write  the multibyte sequence corresponding to
       the wide character wc.
