NAME
       iswcntrl - test for control wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswcntrl (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswcntrl  function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the iscntrl function. It tests whether wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "cntrl".

       The wide character class "cntrl" is  disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "print" and therefore also disjoint
       from its subclasses "graph", "alpha", "upper",  "lower",
       "digit", "xdigit", "punct".

       For  an  unsigned  char  c,  iscntrl(c)  implies  iswcn-
       trl(btowc(c)), but not vice versa.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswcntrl function returns non-zero if wc is  a  wide
       character belonging to the wide character class "cntrl".
       Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

SEE ALSO

NOTES
       The behaviour of iswcntrl depends on the LC_CTYPE  cate-
       gory of the current locale.
