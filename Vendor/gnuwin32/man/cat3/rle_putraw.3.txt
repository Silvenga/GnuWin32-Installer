RLE_PUTRAW(3)                                     RLE_PUTRAW(3)





NAME
       rle_putraw  -  write  run  length encoded data to an RLE
       file.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rle.h>
       #include <rle_raw.h>

       rle_putraw( scanraw, nraw, the_hdr );
       rle_op ** scanraw;
       int * nraw;
       rle_hdr * the_hdr;

DESCRIPTION
       The function rle_putraw provides a structured method for
       creating  run  length  encoded  output.  It is passed an
       array, scanraw,  of  pointers  to  arrays  of  rle_op(3)
       structures, and an array of lengths.  Each rle_op struc-
       ture specifies a run or sequence of pixel  values.   The
       array  nraw  gives  the  number of rle_op structures for
       each channel.  I.e., nraw[i] is the length of the  array
       pointed to by scanraw[i].
