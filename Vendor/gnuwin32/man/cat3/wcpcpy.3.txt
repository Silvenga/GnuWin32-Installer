WCPCPY(3)          Linux Programmer's Manual          WCPCPY(3)





NAME
       wcpcpy  -  copy  a  wide  character  string, returning a
       pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t* wcpcpy (wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcpcpy function is the wide-character equivalent  of
       the stpcpy function. It copies the wide character string
       pointed to by src, including the terminating L'\0' char-
       acter, to the array pointed to by dest.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The  programmer  must  ensure  that there is room for at
       least wcslen(src)+1 wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcpcpy returns a pointer to the end of the  wide-charac-
       ter  string  dest, that is, a pointer to the terminating
       L'\0' character.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.
