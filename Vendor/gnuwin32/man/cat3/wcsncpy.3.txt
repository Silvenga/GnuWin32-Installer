WCSNCPY(3)         Linux Programmer's Manual         WCSNCPY(3)





NAME
       wcsncpy - copy a fixed-size string of wide characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t* wcsncpy (wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsncpy function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the strncpy function. It copies at most n  wide  charac-
       ters  from  the wide-character string pointed to by src,
       including the terminating L'\0' character, to the  array
       pointed  to by dest. Exactly n wide characters are writ-
       ten at dest. If the length wcslen(src) is  smaller  than
       n, the remaining wide characters in the array pointed to
       by dest are filled with L'\0' characters. If the  length
       wcslen(src) is greater or equal to n, the string pointed
       to by dest will not be L'\0' terminated.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there  is  room  for  at
       least n wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcsncpy returns dest.
