Netpbm subroNetpbmlsubroutine_library:)pm_tmpfile() function(3)





NAME
       pm_tmpfile() - tempfile creation routine using TMPFILE

SYNOPSIS
       #include <netpbm/pm.h>

       FILE *
       pm_tmpfile(void);


EXAMPLE
       This  simple  example  creates  a temporary file, writes
       "hello world" to it, then reads back  and  prints  those
       contents.

       #include <netpbm/pm.h>

       FILE * myfile;

       myfile = pm_tmpfile();

       fprintf(myfile, "hello world0);

       fseek(myfile, 0, SEEK_SET);

       fread(buffer, sizeof(buffer), 1, myfile);

       fprintf(STDOUT, "temp file contains '%s'0, buffer);

       fclose(myfile);



DESCRIPTION
       This library function is part of Netpbm(1).

       pm_tmpfile()  creates  and  opens  an  unnamed temporary
       file.  It is basically the same thing as the standard  C
       library tmpfile() function, except that it uses the TMP-
       FILE environment variable to decide where to create  the
       temporary  file.   If  TMPFILE  is  not set or is set to
       something unusable (e.g.  too long), pm_tmpfile()  falls
       back  to  the  value  of  the  standard C library symbol
       P_tmpdir, just like tmpfile().

       Unlike tmpfile(), pm_tmpfile() never returns  NULL.   If
       it  fails,  it  issues  a  message to Standard Error and
       aborts the program, like most libnetpbm routines do.


HISTORY
       pm_tmpfile() was introduced  in  Netpbm  10.20  (January
       2004).
