NAME
       TIFFReadBufferSetup,  TIFFWriteBufferSetup - I/O buffer-
       ing control routines

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFReadBufferSetup(TIFF *tif, tdata_t buffer, tsize_t size);
       int TIFFWriteBufferSetup(TIFF *tif, tdata_t buffer, tsize_t size);

DESCRIPTION
       The following routines are provided  for  client-control
       of  the  I/O  buffers  used by the library. Applications
       need never use these routines; they  are  provided  only
       for ``intelligent clients'' that wish to optimize memory
       usage and/or eliminate potential  copy  operations  that
       can occur when working with images that have data stored
       without compression.

       TIFFReadBufferSetup sets up the data buffer used to read
       raw (encoded) data from a file. If the specified pointer
       is NULL (zero), then a buffer of the appropriate size is
       allocated.  Otherwise the caller must guarantee that the
       buffer is large enough to hold any individual  strip  of
       raw  data.  TIFFReadBufferSetup returns a non-zero value
       if the setup was successful and zero otherwise.

       TIFFWriteBufferSetup sets up the  data  buffer  used  to
       write  raw  (encoded)  data  to a file. If the specified
       size is -1 then the buffer size is selected  to  hold  a
       complete  tile or strip, or at least 8 kilobytes, which-
       ever is greater. If the specified buffer is NULL (zero),
       then  a  buffer  of  the appropriate size is dynamically
       allocated.   TIFFWriteBufferSetup  returns  a   non-zero
       value if the setup was successful and zero otherwise.

DIAGNOSTICS
       %s: No space for data buffer at scanline %ld.  TIFFRead-
       BufferSetup was unable to dynamically allocate space for
       a data buffer.

       %s:  No  space  for output buffer.  TIFFWriteBufferSetup
       was unable to dynamically  allocate  space  for  a  data
       buffer.
