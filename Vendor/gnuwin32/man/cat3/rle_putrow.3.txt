RLE_PUTROW(3)                                     RLE_PUTROW(3)





NAME
       rle_putrow  -  Write  a row (scanline) of data to an RLE
       file.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rle.h>

       void rle_putrow( rows, length, the_hdr );
       rle_pixel ** rows;
       int length;
       rle_hdr * the_hdr;

DESCRIPTION
       Rle_putrow is called for each output scanline when  cre-
       ating  an RLE(5) image.  Rows is an array of pointers to
       the pixel data for the color components of the scanline.
       Rows should have the_hdr->ncolors elements.  If an alpha
       channel is being saved, rows[-1]  should  point  to  the
       alpha  channel  data.  Length is the number of pixels in
       the scanline.  Rows[i] should point to the the_hdr->xmin
       element of the scanline.

       The  function  rle_row_alloc(3)  will  properly allocate
       memory for use by rle_putrow.

BUGS
       Having the scanline indexed from xmin is  an  incredible
       botch.   Its origin lies in the deep dark history of the
       raster toolkit, and it seems it's too late to change  it
       now.
