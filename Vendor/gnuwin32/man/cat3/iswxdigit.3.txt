NAME
       iswxdigit - test for hexadecimal digit wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswxdigit (wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswxdigit function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the isxdigit function. It tests whether wc is a  wide
       character   belonging   to   the  wide  character  class
       "xdigit".

       The wide character class "xdigit" is a subclass  of  the
       wide  character class "alnum", and therefore also a sub-
       class of the wide character class  "graph"  and  of  the
       wide character class "print".

       Being  a  subclass  of the wide character class "print",
       the wide character class "xdigit" is disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "cntrl".

       Being  a  subclass  of the wide character class "graph",
       the wide character class "xdigit" is disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "space" and its subclass "blank".

       Being  a  subclass  of the wide character class "alnum",
       the wide character class "xdigit" is disjoint  from  the
       wide character class "punct".

       The  wide  character  class  "xdigit" always contains at
       least the letters 'A' to 'F', 'a' to 'f' and the  digits
       '0' to '9'.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswxdigit function returns non-zero if wc is a wide
       character  belonging  to  the   wide   character   class
       "xdigit". Otherwise it returns zero.

NOTES
       The behaviour of iswxdigit depends on the LC_CTYPE cate-
       gory of the current locale.
