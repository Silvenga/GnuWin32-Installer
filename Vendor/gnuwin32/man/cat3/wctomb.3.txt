NAME
       wctomb  -  convert  a  wide  character  to  a  multibyte
       sequence

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int wctomb (char* s, wchar_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       If s is not NULL, the wctomb function converts the  wide
       character  wc to its multibyte representation and stores
       it at the beginning of the character array pointed to by
       s.  It  updates  the  shift  state, which is stored in a
       static anonymous variable only known to the wctomb func-
       tion, and returns the length of said multibyte represen-
       tation, i.e. the number of bytes written at s.

       The programmer must ensure that there  is  room  for  at
       least MB_CUR_MAX bytes at s.

       If  s  is  NULL,  the  wctomb  function resets the shift
       state, only known  to  this  function,  to  the  initial
       state,  and  returns  non-zero  if the encoding has non-
       trivial shift state, or zero if the encoding  is  state-
       less.

RETURN VALUE
       If s is not NULL, the wctomb function returns the number
       of bytes that have been written to the byte array at  s.
       If  wc  can  not  be represented as a multibyte sequence
       (according to the current locale), -1 is returned.

       If s is NULL, the wctomb function  returns  non-zero  if
       the encoding has non-trivial shift state, or zero if the
       encoding is stateless.

NOTES
       The behaviour of wctomb depends on the LC_CTYPE category
       of the current locale.

       This  function  is  not  multi-thread safe. The function
       wcrtomb provides a better interface to  the  same  func-
       tionality.
