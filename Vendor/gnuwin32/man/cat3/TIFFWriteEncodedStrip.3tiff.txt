NAME
       TIFFWritedEncodedStrip  -  compress and write a strip of
       data to an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFWriteEncodedStrip(TIFF *tif, tstrip_t strip,
       tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Compress  size  bytes of raw data from buf and write the
       result to the specified strip; replacing any  previously
       written  data.  Note  that the value of strip is a ``raw
       strip number.'' That  is,  the  caller  must  take  into
       account  whether  or not the data are organized in sepa-
       rate planes (PlanarConfiguration=2).

NOTES
       The library writes encoded data using the native machine
       byte  order.  Correctly  implemented  TIFF  readers  are
       expected to do any necessary byte-swapping to  correctly
       process image data with BitsPerSample greater than 8.

       The  strip number must be valid according to the current
       settings of the ImageLength and RowsPerStrip  tags.   An
       image  may  be dynamically grown by increasing the value
       of ImageLength prior to each call  to  TIFFWriteEncoded-
       Strip.

RETURN VALUES
       -1  is  returned if an error was encountered. Otherwise,
       the value of size is returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the  TIFFError(3TIFF)
       routine.

       %s:  File  not open for writing. The file was opened for
       reading, not writing.

       Can not write scanlines to a tiled image. The  image  is
       assumed  to  be organized in tiles because the TileWidth
       and  TileLength  tags  have  been  set   with   TIFFSet-
       Field(3TIFF).

       %s:  Must  set  "ImageWidth"  before  writing data.  The
       image's width has not be set before the first write. See
       TIFFSetField(3TIFF) for information on how to do this.

       %s:  Must set "PlanarConfiguration" before writing data.
       The organization of data has not be defined  before  the
       first  write. See TIFFSetField(3TIFF) for information on
       how to do this.

       %s: No space for strip arrays".  There  was  not  enough
       space  for  the  arrays that hold strip offsets and byte
       counts.
