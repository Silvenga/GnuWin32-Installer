NAME
       wcscasecmp  - compare two wide-character strings, ignor-
       ing case

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcscasecmp (const wchar_t* s1, const wchar_t* s2);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcscasecmp function is the wide-character equivalent
       of the strcasecmp function. It compares the wide-charac-
       ter string pointed  to  by  s1  and  the  wide-character
       string  pointed  to  by  s2,  ignoring  case differences
       (towupper, towlower).

RETURN VALUE
       The wcscasecmp function returns zero if the wide-charac-
       ter  strings at s1 and s2 are equal except for case dis-
       tinctions. It  returns  a  positive  integer  if  s1  is
       greater  than  s2,  ignoring case. It returns a negative
       integer if s1 is smaller than s2, ignoring case.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.

SEE ALSO
       strcasecmp(3), wcscmp(3)

NOTES
       The behaviour of wcscasecmp depends on the LC_CTYPE cat-
       egory of the current locale.
