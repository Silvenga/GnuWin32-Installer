NAME
       wctrans - wide character translation mapping

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wctrans_t wctrans (const char* name);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wctrans_t type represents a mapping which can map a
       wide character to another wide character. Its nature  is
       implementation   dependent,   but   the   special  value
       (wctrans_t)0  denotes  an   invalid   mapping.   Nonzero
       wctrans_t values can be passed to the towctrans function
       to actually perform the wide character mapping.

       The wctrans function returns a  mapping,  given  by  its
       name.  The  set  of  valid names depends on the LC_CTYPE
       category of the current locale, but the following  names
       are valid in all locales.
         "tolower" - realizes the tolower(3) mapping
         "toupper" - realizes the toupper(3) mapping

RETURN VALUE
       The wctrans function returns a mapping descriptor if the
       name is valid. Otherwise it returns (wctrans_t)0.

CONFORMING TO

NOTES
       The behaviour of wctrans depends on the  LC_CTYPE  cate-
       gory of the current locale.
