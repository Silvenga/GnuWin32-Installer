RLE_SKIPROW(3)                                   RLE_SKIPROW(3)





NAME
       rle_skiprow - Skip output scanlines in an RLE file.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rle.h>

       rle_skiprow( the_hdr, nrow )
       rle_hdr * the_hdr;
       int nrow;

DESCRIPTION
       This  routine is used to output blank (background) scan-
       lines to an RLE(5) file.  It is used in conjunction with
       rle_putrow(3) or rle_putraw(3).  The number of scanlines
       indicated by nrow will be blank in the output file.

       rle_putraw(3), librle(3), RLE(5).

BUGS
       Rle_skiprow  should  not  be called when creating an RLE
       file with the_hdr->background set to zero.   The  speci-
       fied  number  of  rows  will indeed be skipped, but they
       will not be filled with  background  when  the  file  is
       read.
