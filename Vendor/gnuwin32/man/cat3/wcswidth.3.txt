       needed to represent the wide-character string pointed to
       by s, but at most n wide characters. If a  non-printable
       wide  character  occurs  among  these  characters, -1 is
       returned.

       The wcswidth function returns the number of column posi-
       tions  for  the wide-character string s, truncated to at
       most length n.

       gory of the current locale.
