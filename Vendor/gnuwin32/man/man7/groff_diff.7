.TH GROFF_DIFF 7 "9 January 2009" "Groff Version 1.20.1"
.SH NAME
groff_diff \- differences between GNU troff and classical troff
.
.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
This manual page describes the language differences between
.IR groff ,
the GNU
.I roff
text processing system, and the classical
.I roff
formatter of the freely available Unix\~7 of the 1970s, documented in
the
.I Troff User's Manual
by
.I Ossanna
and
.IR Kernighan .
This inludes the roff language as well as the intermediate output
format (troff output).
.
.P
The section
.I SEE ALSO
gives pointers to both the classical
.I roff
and the modern
.I groff
documentation.
.
.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH "GROFF LANGUAGE"
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
In this section, all additional features of
.I groff
compared to the classical Unix\~7
.I troff
are described in detail.
.
.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS "Long names"
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
The names of number registers, fonts, strings/\:macros/\:diversions,
special characters (glyphs), and colors can be of any length.
.
In escape sequences, additionally to the classical `\fB(\fP\fIxx\fP'
construction for a two-character glyph name, you can use
`\fB[\fP\fIxxx\fP\fB]\fP' for a name of arbitrary length.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs][ xxx ]
Print the special character (glyph) called
.IR xxx .
.
.TP
.BI \[rs][ "comp1 comp2 .\|.\|." ]
Print composite glyph consisting of multiple components.
.
Example: `\[rs][A\~ho]' is capital letter A with ogonek which finally maps
to glyph name `u0041_0328'.
.
See the
.I groff info file
for details how a glyph name for a composite glyph is constructed, and
.BR groff_char (7)
for a list of glyph name components used in composite glyph names.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]f[ xxx ]
Set font
.IR xxx .
.
Additionally,
.B \[rs]f[]
is a new syntax form equal to
.BR \[rs]fP ,
i.e., to return to the previous font.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]*[ "xxx arg1 arg2 .\|.\|." ]
Interpolate string
.IR xxx ,
taking
.IR arg1 ,
.IR arg2 ,
.I .\|.\|.\&
as arguments.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]n[ xxx ]
Interpolate number register
.IR xxx .
.
.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS "Fractional point sizes"
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
A
.I scaled point
is equal to
.B 1/sizescale
points, where
.B sizescale
is specified in the
.B DESC
file (1 by default).
.
There is a new scale indicator\~\c
.B z
that has the effect of multiplying by sizescale.
.
Requests and escape sequences in troff interpret arguments that
represent a point size as being in units of scaled points, but they
evaluate each such argument using a default scale indicator of\~\c
.BR z .
Arguments treated in this way are the argument to the
.B ps
request, the third argument to the
.B cs
request, the second and fourth arguments to the
.B tkf
request, the argument to the
.B \[rs]H
escape sequence, and those variants of the
.B \[rs]s
escape sequence that take a numeric expression as their argument.
.
.P
For example, suppose sizescale is 1000; then a scaled point is
equivalent to a millipoint; the call
.B .ps\ 10.25
is equivalent to
.B .ps\ 10.25z
and so sets the point size to 10250 scaled points, which is equal to
10.25 points.
.
.P
The number register
.B \[rs]n[.s]
returns the point size in points as decimal fraction.
.
There is also a new number register
.B \[rs]n[.ps]
that returns the point size in scaled points.
.
.P
It would make no sense to use the
.BR z \~\c
scale indicator in a numeric expression whose default scale indicator
was neither
.B u
nor\~\c
.BR z ,
and so
.B troff
disallows this.
.
Similarly it would make no sense to use a scaling indicator other than
.B z
or\~\c
.B u
in a numeric expression whose default scale indicator was\~\c
.BR z ,
and so
.B troff
disallows this as well.
.
.P
There is also new scale indicator\~\c
.B s
which multiplies by the number of units in a scaled point.
.
So, for example,
.B \[rs]n[.ps]s
is equal to
.BR 1m .
Be sure not to confuse the
.B s
and
.BR z \~\c
scale indicators.
.
.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS "Numeric expressions"
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
Spaces are permitted in a number expression within parentheses.
.
.P
.B M
indicates a scale of 100ths of an em.
.B f
indicates a scale of 65536 units, providing fractions for color
definitions with the
.B defcolor
request.
.
For example, 0.5f = 32768u.
.
.TP
.IB e1 >? e2
The maximum of
.I e1
and
.IR e2 .
.
.TP
.IB e1 <? e2
The minimum of
.I e1
and
.IR e2 .
.
.TP
.BI ( c ; e )
Evaluate
.I e
using
.I c
as the default scaling indicator.
.
If
.I c
is missing, ignore scaling indicators in the evaluation of\~\c
.IR e .
.
.

.SS "New escape sequences"
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]A' anything '
This expands to
.B 1
or\~\c
.BR 0 ,
depending on whether
.I anything
is or is not acceptable as the name of a string, macro, diversion, number
register, environment, font, or color.
It returns\~\c
.B 0
if
.I anything
is empty.
.
This is useful if you want to look up user input in some sort of
associative table.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]B' anything '
This expands to
.B 1
or\~\c
.BR 0 ,
depending on whether
.I anything
is or is not a valid numeric expression.
.
It returns\~\c
.B 0
if
.I anything
is empty.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]C' xxx '
Typeset glyph named
.IR xxx .
Normally it is more convenient to use
.BI \[rs][ xxx ]\f[R].
But
.B \[rs]C
has the advantage that it is compatible with recent versions of
.SM UNIX
and is available in compatibility mode.
.
.TP
.B \[rs]E
This is equivalent to an escape character, but it is not interpreted in
copy mode.
.
For example, strings to start and end superscripting could be defined
like this
.
.RS
.IP
.EX
\&.ds { \[rs]v'\-.3m'\[rs]s'\[rs]En[.s]*6u/10u'
\&.ds } \[rs]s0\[rs]v'.3m'
.EE
.RE
.
.IP
The use of
.B \[rs]E
ensures that these definitions work even if
.B \[rs]*{
gets interpreted in copy mode (for example, by being used in a macro
argument).
.RE
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]F f
.TQ
.BI \[rs]F( fm
.TQ
.BI \[rs]F[ fam ]
Change font family.
.
This is the same as the
.B fam
request.
.
.B \[rs]F[]
switches back to the previous color (note that
.B \[rs]FP
won't work; it selects font family `P' instead).
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]m x
.TQ
.BI \[rs]m( xx
.TQ
.BI \[rs]m[ xxx ]
Set drawing color.
.B \[rs]m[]
switches back to the previous color.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]M x
.TQ
.BI \[rs]M( xx
.TQ
.BI \[rs]M[ xxx ]
Set background color for filled objects drawn with the
.BI \[rs]D' .\|.\|. '
commands.
.B \[rs]M[]
switches back to the previous color.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]N' n '
Typeset the glyph with index\~\c
.I n
in the current font.
.IR n \~\c
can be any integer.
.
Most devices only have glyphs with indices between 0 and 255.
.
If the current font does not contain a glyph with that code,
special fonts are
.I not
searched.
.
The
.B \[rs]N
escape sequence can be conveniently used in conjunction with the
.B char
request, for example
.
.RS
.IP
.EX
\&.char \[rs][phone] \[rs]f(ZD\[rs]N'37'
.EE
.RE
.
.IP
The index of each glyph is given in the fourth column in the font
description file after the
.B charset
command.
.
It is possible to include unnamed glyphs in the font description
file by using a name of
.BR \-\-\- ;
the
.B \[rs]N
escape sequence is the only way to use these.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]O n
.TQ
.BI \[rs]O[ n ]
Suppress troff output.
.
The escapes
.BR \[rs]O2 ,
.BR \[rs]O3 ,
.BR \[rs]O4 ,
and
.B \[rs]O5
are intended for internal use by
.BR \%grohtml .
.
.RS
.TP
.B \[rs]O0
Disable any ditroff glyphs from being emitted to the device driver,
provided that the escape occurs at the outer level (see
.B \[rs]O3
and
.BR \[rs]O4 ).
.
.TP
.B \[rs]O1
Enable output of glyphs, provided that the escape occurs at the outer
level.
.IP
.B \[rs]O0
and
.B \[rs]O1
also reset the registers
.BR \[rs]n[opminx] ,
.BR \[rs]n[opminy] ,
.BR \[rs]n[opmaxx] ,
and
.B \[rs]n[opmaxy]
to\~\-1.
.
These four registers mark the top left and bottom right hand corners
of a box which encompasses all written glyphs.
.
.TP
.B \[rs]O2
Provided that the escape occurs at the outer level, enable output of
glyphs and also write out to stderr the page number and four registers
encompassing the glyphs previously written since the last call to
.BR \[rs]O .
.
.TP
.B \[rs]O3
Begin a nesting level.
.
At start-up,
.B troff
is at outer level.
.
This is really an internal mechanism for
.B \%grohtml
while producing images.
.
They are generated by running the troff source through
.B troff
to the postscript device and
.B ghostscript
to produce images in PNG format.
.
The
.B \[rs]O3
escape starts a new page if the device is not html (to reduce the
possibility of images crossing a page boundary).
.
.TP
.B \[rs]O4
End a nesting level.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]O5[ Pfilename ]
This escape is
.B \%grohtml
specific.
.
Provided that this escape occurs at the outer nesting level, write
.I filename
to stderr.
.
The position of the image,
.IR P ,
must be specified and must be one of
.BR l ,
.BR r ,
.BR c ,
or
.B i
(left, right, centered, inline).
.
.I filename
is associated with the production of the next inline image.
.RE

.
.RS
.IP
.BI .nr\  name\ \[+-]n
.RE
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]s( nn
.TQ
.BI \[rs]s\[+-]( nn
Set the point size to
.I nn
points;
.I nn
must be exactly two digits.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]s[\[+-] n ]
.TQ
.BI \[rs]s\[+-][ n ]
.TQ
.BI \[rs]s'\[+-] n '
.TQ
.BI \[rs]s\[+-]' n '
Set the point size to
.I n
scaled points;
.I n
is a numeric expression with a default scale indicator of\~\c
.BR z .
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]V x
.TQ
.BI \[rs]V( xx
.TQ
.BI \[rs]V[ xxx ]
Interpolate the contents of the environment variable
.IR xxx ,
as returned by
.BR getenv (3).
.B \[rs]V
is interpreted in copy mode.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]Y x
.TQ
.BI \[rs]Y( xx
.TQ
.BI \[rs]Y[ xxx ]
This is approximately equivalent to
.BI \[rs]X'\[rs]*[ xxx ]'\f[R].
However the contents of the string or macro
.I xxx
are not interpreted; also it is permitted for
.I xxx
to have been defined as a macro and thus contain newlines (it is not
permitted for the argument to
.B \[rs]X
to contain newlines).
.
The inclusion of newlines requires an extension to the UNIX troff
output format, and confuses drivers that do not know about this
extension.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]Z' anything '
Print anything and then restore the horizontal and vertical position;
.I anything
may not contain tabs or leaders.
.
.TP
.B \[rs]$0
The name by which the current macro was invoked.
.
The
.B als
request can make a macro have more than one name.
.
.TP
.B \[rs]$*
In a macro or string, the concatenation of all the arguments separated
by spaces.
.
.TP
.B \[rs]$@
In a macro or string, the concatenation of all the arguments with each
surrounded by double quotes, and separated by spaces.
.
.TP
.B \[rs]$^
In a macro, the representation of all parameters as if they were an
argument to the
.B ds
request.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]$( nn
.TQ
.BI \[rs]$[ nnn ]
In a macro or string, this gives the
.IR nn -th
or
.IR nnn -th
argument.
.
Macros and strings can have an unlimited number of arguments.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]? anything \[rs]?
When used in a diversion, this transparently embeds
.I anything
in the diversion.
.I anything
is read in copy mode.
.
When the diversion is reread,
.I anything
is interpreted.
.I anything
may not contain newlines; use
.B \[rs]!\&
if you want to embed newlines in a diversion.
.
The escape sequence
.B \[rs]?\&
is also recognized in copy mode and turned into a single internal
code; it is this code that terminates
.IR anything .

This increases the width of the preceding glyph so that the
spacing between that glyph and the following glyph is
correct if the following glyph is a roman glyph.
.
.if t \{\
.  nop For example, if an italic\~f is immediately followed by a roman
.  nop right parenthesis, then in many fonts the top right portion of
.  nop the\~f overlaps the top left of the right parenthesis
.  nop producing \f[I]f\f[R])\f[R], which is ugly.

.  nop produces

.  el       \f[I]f\|\f[R])\f[R]
.  nop and avoids this problem.
.\}
It is a good idea to use this escape sequence whenever an italic
glyph is immediately followed by a roman glyph without any
intervening space.
.
.TP
.B \[rs],
This modifies the spacing of the following glyph so that the
spacing between that glyph and the preceding glyph is
correct if the preceding glyph is a roman glyph.
.
.if t \{\

.IP 1
The character ends sentences (initially characters

.BI .defcolor\  xxx\ scheme\ color_components
Define color
.IR xxx .
.I scheme
can be one of the following values:
.B rgb
(three components),
.B cmy
(three components),
.B cmyk
(four components), and
.B gray
or
.B grey
(one component).
.
Color components can be given either as a hexadecimal string or as
positive decimal integers in the range 0-65535.
.
A hexadecimal string contains all color components concatenated; it
must start with either
.B #
or
.BR ## .
The former specifies hex values in the range 0-255 (which are
internally multiplied by\~257), the latter in the range 0-65535.
.
Examples: #FFC0CB (pink), ##ffff0000ffff (magenta).
.
A new scaling indicator\~\c
.B f
has been introduced which multiplies its value by\~65536; this makes
it convenient to specify color components as fractions in the range 0
to\~1.
.
Example:
.
.RS
.IP
.EX
\&.defcolor darkgreen rgb 0.1f 0.5f 0.2f
.EE
.RE
.
.IP
Note that
.B f

.IP
.EX
\&.defcolor darkgreen rgb 0.1 0.5 0.2

.BI .fchar\  c\ string
Define fallback character (or glyph)\~\c

.B char
hides the glyph with the same name in the current font, whereas a
glyph defined with
.B fchar
is checked only if the particular glyph isn't found in the current font.

.IP \[bu]
.B hpf
checks for the expression
.BR \[rs]patterns{ .\|.\|. }
(possibly with whitespace before and after the braces).

.BI .schar\  c\ string
Define global fallback character (or glyph)\~\c

.B schar
is searched after the list of fonts declared with the
.B special
request but before the mounted special fonts.

.TP
.BI .shc\  c
Set the soft hyphen character to\~\c
.IR c .
If
.I c
is omitted, the soft hyphen character is set to the default
.BR \[rs][hy] .
The soft hyphen character is the glyph which is inserted when
a word is hyphenated at a line break.

If the soft hyphen character does not exist in the font of the
glyph immediately preceding a potential break point, then the line
is not broken at that point.

It sets the available font sizes for the current font to
.IR s1 ,
.IR s2 ,\|.\|.\|.\|,\~ sn
scaled points.

.BI .spreadwarn\  limit
Make
.B troff
emit a warning if the additional space inserted for each space between
words in an output line is larger or equal to
.IR limit .
.
A negative value is changed to zero; no argument toggles the warning on
and off without changing
.IR limit .

The default scaling indicator is\~\c
.BR m .
.
At startup,
.B spreadwarn
is deactivated, and
.I limit
is set to 3m.
.
For example,
.B .spreadwarn\ 0.2m
causes a warning if
.B troff
must add 0.2m or more for each interword space in a line.
.
This request is active only if text is justified to both margins (using
.BR .ad\ b ).
.
.TP
.BI .sty\  n\ f
Associate style\~\c
.I f
with font position\~\c
.IR n .
A font position can be associated either with a font or with a style.
.
The current font is the index of a font position and so is also either
a font or a style.
.
When it is a style, the font that is actually used is the font the
name of which is the concatenation of the name of the current family
and the name of the current style.
.
For example, if the current font is\~1 and font position\~1 is
associated with style\~\c
.B R
and the current font family is\~\c
.BR T ,
then font
.BR TR
is used.
.
If the current font is not a style, then the current family is ignored.
.
When the requests
.BR cs ,
.BR bd ,
.BR tkf ,
.BR uf ,
or
.B fspecial
are applied to a style, then they are applied instead to the
member of the current family corresponding to that style.
.
The default family can be set with the
.B \-f
command line option.
.
The
.B styles
command in the
.SM DESC
file controls which font positions (if any) are initially associated
with styles rather than fonts.

The first character in the string has index\~0.
.
If
.I n2
is omitted, it is taken to be equal to the string's length.
.
If the index value
.I n1
or
.I n2
is negative, it is counted from the end of the string,
going backwards:

the width of every glyph is increased by an amount between
.I n1
and
.IR n2 ;
when the current point size is less than or equal to

the width is increased by

when it is greater than or equal to
.I s2
the width is increased by

.TP
.BI .trin\  abcd
This is the same as the

translation.

.TP
.BI .unformat\  xx
This request `unformats' the diversion
.IR xx .
Contrary to the
.B asciify
request, which tries to convert formatted elements of the diversion
back to input tokens as much as possible,
.B .unformat
only handles tabs and spaces between words (usually caused by
spaces or newlines in the input) specially.
.
The former are treated as if they were input tokens, and the latter
are stretchable again.
.
Note that the vertical size of lines is not preserved.
.
Glyph information (font, font size, space width, etc.) is retained.
.
Useful in conjunction with the
.B box
and
.B boxa
requests.
.
.TP
.BI .vpt\  n
Enable vertical position traps if
.I n
is non-zero, disable them otherwise.
.
Vertical position traps are traps set by the
.B wh
or
.B dt

.
Traps set by the
.B it
request are not vertical position traps.
.
The parameter that controls whether vertical position traps are
enabled is global.
.
Initially vertical position traps are enabled.
.
.TP
.BI .warn\  n
Control warnings.
.IR n \~\c
is the sum of the numbers associated with each warning that is to be
enabled; all other warnings are disabled.
.
The number associated with each warning is listed in
.BR troff (1).
.
For example,
.B .warn\~0
disables all warnings, and
.B .warn\~1
disables all warnings except that about missing glyphs.
.
If
.I n
is not given, all warnings are enabled.

.BI .cf\  filename
When used in a diversion, this embeds in the diversion an object
which, when reread, will cause the contents of
.I filename
to be transparently copied through to the output.
.
In UNIX troff, the contents of
.I filename
is immediately copied through to the output regardless of whether
there is a current diversion; this behaviour is so anomalous that it
must be considered a bug.

In compatibility mode, these requests behaves similar to
.BR .de1 ,
.BR .am1 ,
.BR .ds1 ,
and
.BR .as1 ,
respectively: A `compatibility save' token is inserted at the
beginning, and a `compatibility restore' token at the end, with
compatibility mode switched on during execution.
.
.TP
.BI .ev\  xx
If
.I xx
is not a number, this switches to a named environment called
.IR xx .
The environment should be popped with a matching
.B ev
request without any arguments, just as for numbered environments.
.
There is no limit on the number of named environments; they are
created the first time that they are referenced.
.
.TP
.BI .ss\  m\ n
When two arguments are given to the
.B ss
request, the second argument gives the
.IR "sentence space size" .
If the second argument is not given, the sentence space size
is the same as the word space size.
.
Like the word space size, the sentence space is in units of
one twelfth of the spacewidth parameter for the current font.
.
Initially both the word space size and the sentence
space size are\~12.
.
Contrary to UNIX troff, GNU troff handles this request in nroff mode
also; a given value is then rounded down to the nearest multiple
of\~12.
.
The sentence space size is used in two circumstances.
.
If the end of a sentence occurs at the end of a line in fill mode,
then both an inter-word space and a sentence space are added; if
two spaces follow the end of a sentence in the middle of a line, then
the second space is a sentence space.
.
Note that the behaviour of UNIX troff are exactly that exhibited
by GNU troff if a second argument is never given to the
.B ss
request.
.
In GNU troff, as in UNIX troff, you should always follow a sentence
with either a newline or two spaces.
.

.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS Miscellaneous
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
.B troff
predefines a single (read/write) string-based register,
.BR \[rs]*[.T] ,
which contains the argument given to the
.B \-T
command line option, namely the current output device (for example,
.I latin1
or
.IR ascii ).
Note that this is not the same as the (read-only) number register
.B \[rs]n[.T]
which is defined to be\~1 if
.B troff
is called with the
.B \-T
command line option, and zero otherwise.
.
This behaviour is different to UNIX troff.
.
.P
Fonts not listed in the
.SM DESC
file are automatically mounted on the next available font position
when they are referenced.
.
If a font is to be mounted explicitly with the
.B fp
request on an unused font position, it should be mounted on the first
unused font position, which can be found in the
.B \[rs]n[.fp]
register; although
.B troff
does not enforce this strictly, it does not allow a font to be mounted
at a position whose number is much greater than that of any currently
used position.
.
.P
Interpolating a string does not hide existing macro arguments.
.
Thus in a macro, a more efficient way of doing
.
.IP
.BI . xx\  \[rs]\[rs]$@
.P
is
.
.IP
.BI \[rs]\[rs]*[ xx ]\[rs]\[rs]  
.
.P
If the font description file contains pairwise kerning information,
glyphs from that font are kerned.
.
Kerning between two glyphs can be inhibited by placing a
.B \[rs]&
between them.
.
.P
In a string comparison in a condition, characters that appear at
different input levels to the first delimiter character are not
recognized as the second or third delimiters.
.
This applies also to the
.B tl
request.
.
In a
.B \[rs]w
escape sequence, a character that appears at a different input level
to the starting delimiter character is not recognized as the
closing delimiter character.
.
The same is true for
.BR \[rs]A ,
.BR \[rs]b ,
.BR \[rs]B ,
.BR \[rs]C ,
.BR \[rs]l ,
.BR \[rs]L ,
.BR \[rs]o ,
.BR \[rs]X ,
and
.BR \[rs]Z .
.
When decoding a macro or string argument that is delimited by double
quotes, a character that appears at a different input level to the starting
delimiter character is not recognized as the closing delimiter
character.
.
The implementation of
.B \[rs]$@
ensures that the double quotes surrounding an argument appear at the
same input level, which is different to the input level of the
argument itself.
.
In a long escape name
.B ]
is not recognized as a closing delimiter except when it occurs at
the same input level as the opening\~\c
.BR ] .
.
In compatibility mode, no attention is paid to the input-level.
.
.P
There are some new types of condition:
.
.TP
.BI .if\ r xxx
True if there is a number register named

True if there is a color named

.I ch
is either an
.SM ASCII
character or a glyph (special character)
.BI \[rs]N' xxx '\f[R],
.BI \[rs]( xx
or
.BI \[rs][ xxx ]\f[R];
the condition is also true if
.I ch
has been defined by the
.B char
request.
.
.TP
.BI .if\ F f
True if font\~\c
.I f
exists.
.
.BR f \~\c
is handled as if it was opened with the
.B ft
request (this is, font translation and styles are applied), without
actually mounting it.
.
.TP
.BI .if\ S s
True if style\~\c
.I s
has been registered.
.
Font translation is applied.
.
.P
The
.B tr
request can now map characters onto
.BR \[rs]~ .
.
.P
The space width emitted by the
.B \[rs]|
and
.B \[rs]^
escape sequences can be controlled on a per-font basis.
If there is a glyph named
.B \[rs]|
or
.BR \[rs]^ ,
respectively (note the leading backslash), defined in the current font file,
use this glyph's width instead of the default value.
.
.P
It is now possible to have whitespace between the first and second dot

If the

line is present in the DESC file, troff uses the following two
commands.
.
.TP
.BI t xxx
.I xxx
is any sequence of characters terminated by a space or a newline (to
be more precise, it is a sequence of glyphs which are accessed with
the corresponding characters); the first character should be printed at
the current position, the current horizontal position should be increased
by the width of the first character, and so on for each character.
.
The width of the glyph is that given in the font file,
appropriately scaled for the current point size, and rounded so that
it is a multiple of the horizontal resolution.
.
Special characters cannot be printed using this command.
.
.TP
.BI u n\ xxx
This is same as the
.BR t \~\c
command except that after printing each character, the current
horizontal position is increased by the sum of the width of that
character and\~\c
.IR n .
.
.P
Note that single characters can have the eighth bit set, as can the
names of fonts and special characters.
.
.P
The names of glyphs and fonts can be of arbitrary length; drivers
should not assume that they are only two characters long.
.
.P
When a glyph is to be printed, that glyph is always
in the current font.
.
Unlike device-independent troff, it is not necessary for drivers to
search special fonts to find a glyph.

option is given.
.
.TP
\f[B]Df \f[I]n\f[R]\*[ic]\[rs]n
Set the shade of gray to be used for filling solid objects to
.IR n ;
.I n
must be an integer between 0 and 1000, where 0 corresponds solid white
and 1000 to solid black, and values in between correspond to
intermediate shades of gray.
.
This applies only to solid circles, solid ellipses and solid
polygons.
.
By default, a level of 1000 is used.
.
Whatever color a solid object has, it should completely obscure
everything beneath it.
.
A value greater than 1000 or less than\~0 can also be used: this means
fill with the shade of gray that is currently being used for lines and
text.
.
Normally this is black, but some drivers may provide a way of
changing this.
.
.IP
The corresponding
.BI \[rs]D'f .\|.\|. '
command shouldn't be used since its argument is always rounded to an
integer multiple of the horizontal resolution which can lead to
surprising results.
.
.TP
\f[B]DC \f[I]d\f[R]\*[ic]\[rs]n
Draw a solid circle with a diameter of
.I d
with the leftmost point at the current position.
.
.TP
\f[B]DE \f[I]dx dy\f[R]\*[ic]\[rs]n
Draw a solid ellipse with a horizontal diameter of
.I dx
and a vertical diameter of
.I dy
with the leftmost point at the current position.
.EQ
delim $$
.EN
.
.TP
\f[B]Dp\f[R] $dx sub 1$ $dy sub 1$ $dx sub 2$ $dy sub 2$ $...$ $dx sub n$ $dy sub n$\[rs]n
Draw a polygon with, for $i = 1 ,..., n+1$, the
.IR i -th
vertex at the current position 
.
$+ sum from j=1 to i-1 ( dx sub j , dy sub j )$.
.
At the moment, GNU pic only uses this command to generate triangles
and rectangles.
.
.TP
\f[B]DP\f[R] $dx sub 1$ $dy sub 1$ $dx sub 2$ $dy sub 2$ $...$ $dx sub n$ $dy sub n$\[rs]n
.
Like
.B Dp
but draw a solid rather than outlined polygon.
.
.TP
\f[B]Dt \f[I]n\f[R]\*[ic]\[rs]n
Set the current line thickness to
.IR n \~\c
machine units.
.
Traditionally Unix troff drivers use a line thickness proportional to
the current point size; drivers should continue to do this if no
.B Dt
command has been given, or if a
.B Dt
command has been given with a negative value of\~\c
.IR n .
A zero value of\~\c
.I n
selects the smallest available line thickness.
.
.P
A difficulty arises in how the current position should be changed after
the execution of these commands.
.
This is not of great importance since the code generated by GNU pic
does not depend on this.
.
Given a drawing command of the form
.IP
\f[B]\[rs]D'\f[I]c\f[R] $x sub 1$ $y sub 1$ $x sub 2$ $y sub 2$ $...$ $x sub n$ $y sub n$\f[B]'\f[R]
.
.P
where
.I c
is not one of
.BR c ,
.BR e ,
.BR l ,
.BR a ,
or\~\c
.BR ~ ,
Unix troff treats each of the $x sub i$ as a horizontal quantity,
and each of the $y sub i$ as a vertical quantity and assumes that
the width of the drawn object is $sum from i=1 to n x sub i$,
and that the height is $sum from i=1 to n y sub i$.
.
(The assumption about the height can be seen by examining the
.B st
and
.B sb
registers after using such a
.BR D \~\c
command in a
.B \[rs]w
escape sequence).
.
This rule also holds for all the original drawing commands with the
exception of
.BR De .
For the sake of compatibility GNU troff also follows this rule, even
though it produces an ugly result in the case of the
.B Dt
and
.BR Df ,
and, to a lesser extent,
.B DE
commands.
.
Thus after executing a
.BR D \~\c
command of the form
.IP
\f[B]D\f[I]c\f[R] $x sub 1$ $y sub 1$ $x sub 2$ $y sub 2$ $...$ $x sub n$ $y sub n$\[rs]n
.
.P
the current position should be increased by
.
$( sum from i=1 to n x sub i , sum from i=1 to n y sub i )$.
.
.P
Another set of extensions is
.
.TP
\f[B]DFc \f[I]cyan magenta yellow\f[R]\*[ic]\[rs]n
.TQ
\f[B]DFd\f[R]\*[ic]\[rs]n
.TQ
\f[B]DFg \f[I]gray\f[R]\*[ic]\[rs]n
.TQ
\f[B]DFk \f[I]cyan magenta yellow black\f[R]\*[ic]\[rs]n
.TQ
\f[B]DFr \f[I]red green blue\f[R]\*[ic]\[rs]n
Set the color components of the filling color similar to the
.BR m \~\c
commands above.
.
.P
The current position isn't changed by those colour commands (contrary to
.BR Df ).
.
.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS "Device Control Commands"
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
There is a continuation convention which permits the argument to the
.B x\ X
command to contain newlines: when outputting the argument to the
.B x\ X
command, GNU troff follows each newline in the argument with a
.B +
character (as usual, it terminates the entire argument with a
newline); thus if the line after the line containing the
.B x\ X
command starts with
.BR + ,
then the newline ending the line containing the
.B x\ X
command should be treated as part of the argument to the
.B x\ X
command, the
.B +
should be ignored, and the part of the line following the
.B +
should be treated like the part of the line following the
.B x\ X
command.
.
.P
The first three output commands are guaranteed to be:
.IP
.BI x\ T\  device
.br
.BI x\ res\  n\ h\ v
.br
.B x init

.SH INCOMPATIBILITIES
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
In spite of the many extensions, groff has retained compatibility to
classical troff to a large degree.
.
For the cases where the extensions lead to collisions, a special
compatibility mode with the restricted, old functionality was created
for groff.
.
.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS "Groff Language"
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
.I groff
provides a
.B compatibility mode
that allows to process roff code written for classical
.B troff
or for other implementations of roff in a consistent way.
.
.P
Compatibility mode can be turned on with the
.B \-C
command line option, and turned on or off with the
.B .cp
request.
.
The number register
.B \[rs]n(.C
is\~1 if compatibility mode is on, 0\~otherwise.
.
.P
This became necessary because the GNU concept for long names causes
some incompatibilities.
.I Classical troff
interprets
.IP
.B .dsabcd
.
.P
as defining a string
.B ab
with contents
.BR cd .
In
.IR groff
mode, this is considered as a call of a macro named
.BR dsabcd .
.
.P
Also
.I classical troff
interprets
.B \[rs]*[
or
.B \[rs]n[
as references to a string or number register called\~\c
.B [
while
.I groff
takes this as the start of a long name.
.
.P
In
.IR "compatibility mode" ,
groff interprets these things in the traditional way; so long
names are not recognized.
.
.P
On the other hand, groff in
.I GNU native mode
does not allow to use the single-character escapes
.B \[rs]\[rs]
(backslash),
.B \[rs]|
(vertical bar),
.B \[rs]^
(caret),
.B \[rs]&
(ampersand),
.B \[rs]{
(opening brace),
.B \[rs]}
(closing brace),
.RB ` \[rs]\  '
(space),
.B \[rs]'
(single quote),
.B \[rs]`
(backquote),
.B \[rs]\-
(minus),
.B \[rs]_
(underline),
.B \[rs]!\&
(bang),
.B \[rs]%
(percent),
and
.B \[rs]c
(character\~c) in names of strings, macros, diversions, number
registers, fonts or environments, whereas
.I classical troff
does.
.
.P
The
.B \[rs]A
escape sequence can be helpful in avoiding these escape sequences in
names.
.
.P
Fractional point sizes cause one noteworthy incompatibility.
.
In
.I classical
.IR troff ,
the
.B ps
request ignores scale indicators and so
.RS
.P
.B .ps\~10u
.RE
.
.P
sets the point size to 10\~points, whereas in groff native mode the
point size is set to 10\~scaled points.
.
.P
In
.IR groff ,
there is a fundamental difference between unformatted input
characters, and formatted output characters (glyphs).
.
Everything that affects how a glyph is output is
stored with the glyph; once a glyph has been
constructed it is unaffected by any subsequent requests that are
executed, including the
.BR bd ,
.BR cs ,
.BR tkf ,
.BR tr ,
or
.B fp
requests.
.
.P
Normally glyphs are constructed from input characters at
the moment immediately before the glyph is added to the current
output line.
.
Macros, diversions and strings are all, in fact, the same type of
object; they contain lists of input characters and glyphs
in any combination.
.
.P
Special characters can be both; before being added to the output, they
act as input entities, afterwards they denote glyphs.
.
.P
A glyph does not behave like an input character for the
purposes of macro processing; it does not inherit any of the special
properties that the input character from which it was constructed
might have had.
.
The following example makes things clearer.
.
.P
.RS
.EX
\&.di x
\[rs]\[rs]\[rs]\[rs]
\&.br
\&.di
\&.x
.EE
.RE
.
.P
With
.I GNU troff
this is printed as
.BR \[rs]\[rs] .
So each pair of input backslashes
\&`\[rs]\[rs]'
is turned into a single output backslash glyph
\&`\[rs]'
and the resulting output backslashes are not interpreted as escape
characters when they are reread.
.
.P
.I Classical troff
would interpret them as escape characters when they were reread and
would end up printing a single backslash `\[rs]'.
.
.P
In GNU, the correct way to get a printable version of the backslash
character `\[rs]'
is the
.B \[rs](rs
escape sequence, but classical troff does not provide a clean feature
for getting a non-syntactical backslash.
.
A close method is the printable version of the current escape
character using the
.B \[rs]e
escape sequence; this works if the current escape character is not
redefined.
.
It works in both GNU mode and compatibility mode, while dirty tricks
like specifying a sequence of multiple backslashes do not work
reliably; for the different handling in diversions, macro definitions,
or text mode quickly leads to a confusion about the necessary number of
backslashes.
.
.P
To store an escape sequence in a diversion that is interpreted
when the diversion is reread, either the traditional
.B \[rs]!\&
transparent output facility or the
new
.B \[rs]?\&
escape sequence can be used.
.
.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS "Intermediate Output"
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
The groff intermediate output format is in a state of evolution.
.
So far it has some incompatibilities, but it is intended to establish
a full compatibility to the classical troff output format.
.
Actually the following incompatibilities exist:
.
.IP \[bu] 2m
The positioning after the drawing of the polygons conflicts with the
classical definition.
.
.IP \[bu] 2m
The intermediate output cannot be rescaled to other devices as
classical `device-independent' troff did.
