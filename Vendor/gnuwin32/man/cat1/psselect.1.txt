NAME
       psselect - select pages from a PostScript file

SYNOPSIS
       psselect [ -q ] [ -e ] [ -o ] [ -r ] [ -ppages ] [ pages
       ] [ infile [ outfile ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Psselect selects pages from a PostScript document,  cre-
       ating  a  new PostScript file. The input PostScript file
       should follow the  Adobe  Document  Structuring  Conven-
       tions.

       The  -e  option selects all of the even pages; it may be
       used  in  conjunction  with  the  other  page  selection
       options  to select the even pages from a range of pages.

       The -o option selects all of the odd pages;  it  may  be
       used  in  conjunction  with  the  other  page  selection
       options.

       The -ppages option specifies the pages which are  to  be
       selected.   Pages  is  a  comma  separated  list of page
       ranges, each of which may be a page number,  or  a  page
       range  of  the form first-last. If first is omitted, the
       first page is assumed, and if last is omitted, the  last
       page is assumed.

       The  prefix character `_' indicates that the page number
       is relative to the end of the document,  counting  back-
       wards.  If  just  this  character with no page number is
       used, a blank page will be inserted.

       The -r option causes psselect  to  output  the  selected
       pages in reverse order.

       Psselect  normally  prints the page numbers of the pages
       rearranged; the -q option suppresses this.

       If any of the -r, -e, or -o options are  specified,  the
       page range must be given with the -p option. This is for
       backwards compatibility with previous versions.


NOTES
       The page number given to psselect is the number  of  the
       page  counting from the start or end of the file, start-
       ing at one. The actual page number in the  document  may
       be different.
