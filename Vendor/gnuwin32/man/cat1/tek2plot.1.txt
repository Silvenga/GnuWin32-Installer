TEK2PLOT(1)          GNU Plotting Utilities         TEK2PLOT(1)





NAME
       tek2plot  -  translate Tektronix files to other graphics
       formats

SYNOPSIS
       tek2plot [ options ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       tek2plot translates Tektronix graphics  files  to  other
       formats, or displays them on an X Window System display.
       The output format or display type is specified with  the
       -T  option.   The  possible  output  formats and display
       types are the  same  as  those  supported  by  graph(1),
       plot(1),  pic2plot(1),  and  plotfont(1).   If an output
       file is produced, it is written to standard output.

       Options and file names may be interspersed on  the  com-
       mand line, but the options are processed before the file
       names are read.  If -- is seen, it is interpreted as the
       end  of the options.  If no file names are specified, or
       the file name - is encountered, the  standard  input  is
       read.

OPTIONS
   General Options
       -T type
       --display-type type
              Select type as the output format or display type.
              It may be "X", "png", "pnm", "gif", "svg",  "ai",
              "ps",   "cgm",  "fig",  "pcl",  "hpgl",  "regis",
              "tek", or  "meta"  (the  default).   These  refer
              respectively  to the X Window System, PNG (Porta-
              ble Network  Graphics)  format,  portable  anymap
              format  (PBM/PGM/PPM),  a  pseudo-GIF format that
              does not use  LZW  encoding,  the  new  XML-based
              Scalable  Vector Graphics format, the format used
              by Adobe Illustrator, Postscript or  Encapsulated
              Postscript   (EPS)   that   can  be  edited  with
              idraw(1), CGM format (by default,  confirming  to
              the  WebCGM  profile),  the  format  used  by the
              xfig(1) drawing editor, the Hewlett-Packard PCL 5
              printer  language,  the  Hewlett-Packard Graphics
              Language, ReGIS graphics  format  (which  can  be
              displayed  by  the dxterm(1) terminal emulator or
              by a VT330 or VT340 terminal),  Tektronix  format
              itself,  and device-independent GNU metafile for-
              mat.  Unless type is "X", an output file is  pro-
              duced and written to standard output.

              Omitting  the -T option is equivalent to specify-
              ing -T meta.  GNU metafile format may  be  trans-
              lated to other formats with plot(1).

       -p n
       --page-number n
              Output  only  page number n, within the Tektronix
              file or sequence of Tektronix files that is being
              translated.   n  must  be a non-negative integer,
              since a Tektronix file may consist of one or more
              pages, numbered beginning with zero.

              The default behavior if the -p option is not used
              is to output all nonempty  pages  in  succession.
              For   example,   tek2plot   -T  X  displays  each
              Tektronix page in its own X window.   If  the  -T
              png,  -T  pnm, -T gif, -T ai, or -T fig option is
              used, the default behavior is to output only  the
              first  nonempty  Tektronix  page,  since files in
              those output formats contain only a  single  page
              of graphics.

              Most  Tektronix  files consist of either one page
              (page #0) or two pages (an  empty  page  #0,  and
              page  #1).   Tektronix  files produced by the GNU
              plotting utilities (e.g., by graph  -T  tek)  are
              normally of the latter sort.

       -F name
       --font-name name
              Use  the  font name for rendering the native Tex-
              tronix fonts, if it is  available.   The  default
              font  is  "Courier"  except  for tek2plot -T png,
              tek2plot -T pnm, tek2plot  -T  gif,  tek2plot  -T
              hpgl, tek2plot -T regis, and tek2plot -T tek, for
              which it is "HersheySerif".  A list of  available
              fonts  can  be  obtained  with  the  --help-fonts
              option  (see  below).   If  a  font  outside  the
              Courier  family  is  used,  the  --position-chars
              option (see below) should probably be  specified.

              The  -F  option is useful only if you have a Tek-
              tronix file that draws  text  using  native  Tek-
              tronix  fonts.   Tektronix  files produced by the
              GNU plotting utilities (e.g., by graph -T tek) do
              not  use native Tektronix fonts: they use Hershey
              vector fonts instead.

       -W line_width
       --line-width line_width
              Set the width of lines,  as  a  fraction  of  the
              width  of the display, to be line_width.  A nega-
              tive value means that a default value  should  be
              used.    This  value  is  format-dependent.   The
              interpretation of zero line width is also format-
              dependent  (in  some output formats, a zero-width
              line is the thinnest line that can be  drawn;  in
              others, a zero-width line is invisible).

       --bg-color name
              Set the color used for the background to be name.
              This is relevant only to tek2plot -T X,  tek2plot
              -T   png,  tek2plot  -T  pnm,  tek2plot  -T  gif,
              tek2plot -T svg, tek2plot -T cgm, and tek2plot -T
              regis.   An  unrecognized  name sets the color to
              the default, which is "white".   The  environment
              variable  BG_COLOR  can  equally  well be used to
              specify the background color.  If the -T  svg  or
              -T  cgm  option is used, an output file without a
              background may be produced by setting  the  back-
              ground color to "none".

              If  the -T png or -T gif option is used, a trans-
              parent PNG  file  or  a  transparent  pseudo-GIF,
              respectively,  may  be  produced  by  setting the
              TRANSPARENT_COLOR  environment  variable  to  the
              name of the background color.

       --bitmap-size bitmap_size
              Set the size of the graphics display in which the
              plot will be drawn, in terms  of  pixels,  to  be
              bitmap_size.   The default is "570x570".  This is
              relevant only to plot -T X, plot -T png, plot  -T
              pnm,  and plot -T gif.  If you choose a rectangu-
              lar (non-square) window size, the  fonts  in  the
              plot  will  be  scaled  anisotropically, i.e., by
              different factors in the horizontal and  vertical
              directions.   For  plot  -T  X,  this requires an
              X11R6 display.  Any font that cannot be scaled in
              this  way  will be replaced by a default scalable
              font, such as the vector font "HersheySerif".

              The environment variable BITMAPSIZE  can  equally
              well  be  used  to  specify the window size.  For
              backward   compatibility,    the    X    resource
              Xplot.geometry may be used instead.

       --emulate-color option
              If  option is yes, replace each color in the out-
              put by an appropriate shade  of  gray.   This  is
              seldom  useful,  except  when using ` tek2plot -T
              pcl to prepare output for a PCL 5 device.   (Many
              monochrome  PCL  5  devices,  such  as monochrome
              LaserJets, do a poor job of  emulating  color  on
              their  own.)   You may equally well request color
              emulation by  setting  the  environment  variable
              EMULATE_COLOR to "yes".

       --max-line-length max_line_length
              Set the maximum number of points that a polygonal
              line may contain, before it is flushed out, to be
              max_line_length.   If  this  flushing occurs, the
              polygonal line will be split  into  two  or  more
              sub-lines,  though  the  splitting  should not be
              noticeable.  The default value of max_line_length
              is 500.

              The  reason for splitting long polygonal lines is
              that some display devices (e.g.,  old  Postscript
              printers  and  HP-GL  pen  plotters) have limited
              buffer   sizes.    The    environment    variable
              MAX_LINE_LENGTH  can  also be used to specify the
              maximum line length.

       --page-size pagesize
              Set the size of the page on which the  plot  will
              be positioned.  This is relevant only to tek2plot
              -T svg, tek2plot -T ai, tek2plot -T ps,  tek2plot
              -T  cgm,  tek2plot  -T  fig, tek2plot -T pcl, and
              tek2plot -T hpgl.  The default is "letter", which
              means  an 8.5 inch by 11 inch page.  Any ISO page
              size in the range "a0"..."a4" or ANSI  page  size
              in the range "a"..."e" may be specified ("letter"
              is an alias for "a" and "tabloid" is an alias for
              "b").   "legal"  and "ledger" are recognized page
              sizes also.  The  environment  variable  PAGESIZE
              can  equally  well  be  used  to specify the page
              size.

              The graphics display in which the plot  is  drawn
              will  be a square region that would occupy nearly
              the full width of the specified page.  An  alter-
              native size for the graphics display can be spec-
              ified.  For example, the page size could be spec-
              ified    as    "letter,xsize=4in,ysize=6in",   or
              "a4,xsize=5.0cm,ysize=100mm".   For  all  of  the
              above  except tek2plot -T hpgl, the graphics dis-
              play will, by default, be centered on  the  page.
              For  all  of the above except tek2plot -T svg and
              tek2plot -T cgm,  the  graphics  display  may  be
              repositioned manually, by specifying the location
              of its lower left corner, relative to  the  lower
              left  corner  of the page.  For example, the page
              size  could   be   specified   as   "letter,xori-
              gin=2in,yorigin=3in",                          or
              "a4,xorigin=0.5cm,yorigin=0.5cm".   It  is   also
              possible  to specify an offset vector.  For exam-
              ple, the page size could be  specified  as  "let-
              ter,xoffset=1in",   or  "letter,xoffset=1in,yoff-
              set=1.2in", or "a4,yoffset=-1cm".  In SVG  format
              and  WebCGM  format it is possible to specify the
              size of the graphics display, but not  its  posi-
              tion.

       --pen-color name
              Set  the  pen  color to be name.  An unrecognized
              name sets the pen color to the default, which  is
              "black".

       --position-chars
              Position the characters in each text string indi-
              vidually.  If the text font is not  a  member  of
              the Courier family, and especially if it is not a
              fixed-width font, this option is recommended.  It
              will  improve  the appearance of text strings, at
              the price of making it difficult to edit the out-
              put  file with xfig(1), idraw(1), or Illustrator.

       --rotation angle
              Rotate the graphics  display  by  angle  degrees.
              Recognized  values  are  "0",  "90",  "180",  and
              "270".  "no" and "yes" are equivalent to "0"  and
              "90",  respectively.   The  environment  variable
              ROTATION can also be used to specify  a  rotation
              angle.

       --use-tek-fonts
              Use the bitmap fonts that were used on the origi-
              nal Tektronix 4010/4014 terminal.  This option is
              relevant  only  to tek2plot -T X.  The four rele-
              vant bitmap fonts are distributed with most  ver-
              sions  of  the  GNU plotting utilities, under the
              names "tekfont0"..."tekfont3".  They  can  easily
              be  installed  on any modern X Window System dis-
              play.  For this option to work properly, you must
              also  select  a  window size of 1024x1024 pixels,
              either  by  using  the  --bitmap-size   1024x1024
              option or by setting the value of the Xplot.geom-
              etry resource.  This  is  because  bitmap  fonts,
              unlike  the scalable fonts that tek2plot normally
              uses, cannot be rescaled.

              This option is useful only if you have a file  in
              Tektronix  format  that  draws  text using native
              Tektronix fonts.  Tektronix files produced by the
              GNU plotting utilities (e.g., by graph -T tek) do
              not use native Tektronix fonts: they use  Hershey
              vector fonts instead.

   Options for Metafile Output
       The  following  option is relevant only if the -T option
       is omitted or if -T meta is used.  In this case tek2plot
       outputs  a  GNU  graphics metafile, which must be trans-
       lated to other formats with plot(1).

       -O
       --portable-output
              Output the portable (human-readable)  version  of
              GNU metafile format, rather than a binary version
              (the default).  The format of the binary  version
              is machine-dependent.

   Informational Options
       --help Print a list of command-line options, and exit.

       --help-fonts
              Print  a table of available fonts, and exit.  The
              table will depend on which output format or  dis-
              play  type  is  specified  with  the  -T  option.
              tek2plot -T X, tek2plot -T svg, tek2plot  -T  ai,
              tek2plot  -T ps, tek2plot -T cgm, and tek2plot -T
              fig  each  support  the  35  standard  Postscript
              fonts.   tek2plot  -T  svg,  tek2plot -T pcl, and
              tek2plot -T hpgl support the 45  standard  PCL  5
              fonts,  and  the  latter  two support a number of
              Hewlett-Packard vector fonts.  All seven  support
              a  set of 22 Hershey vector fonts, as do tek2plot
              -T  png,  tek2plot  -T  pnm,  tek2plot  -T   gif,
              tek2plot -T regis, and tek2plot -T tek.  tek2plot
              without a -T option in principle supports any  of
              these  fonts, since its output must be translated
              to other formats with plot(1).

              The plotfont(1) utility may be used to  obtain  a
              character map of any supported font.

       --list-fonts
              Like  --help-fonts, but lists the fonts in a sin-
              gle column to facilitate  piping  to  other  pro-
              grams.  If no output format is specified with the
              -T option, the full set  of  supported  fonts  is
              listed.

       --version
              Print  the  version  number  of  tek2plot and the
              plotting utilities package, and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       The   environment   variables   BITMAPSIZE,    PAGESIZE,
       BG_COLOR,  EMULATE_COLOR,  MAX_LINE_LENGTH  and ROTATION
       serve  as  backups  for   the   options   --bitmap-size,
       --page-size,         --bg-color,        --emulate-color,
       --max-line-length, and  --rotation,  respectively.   The
       remaining environment variables are specific to individ-
       ual output formats.

       tek2plot -T X, which pops up a window  on  an  X  Window
       System display and draws graphics in it, checks the DIS-
       PLAY environment variable.   Its  value  determines  the
       display that will be used.

       tek2plot  -T png and tek2plot -T gif, which produce out-
       put in PNG format and  pseudo-GIF  format  respectively,
       are  affected by the INTERLACE environment variable.  If
       its value is  "yes",  the  output  will  be  interlaced.
       Also,  if  the TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment variable is
       set to the name of a color, that color will  be  treated
       as transparent in the output.

       tek2plot  -T  pnm,  which  produces  output  in portable
       anymap (PBM/PGM/PPM) format, is affected by the PNM_POR-
       TABLE  environment variable.  If its value is "yes", the
       output will be in a human-readable  format  rather  than
       binary (the default).

       tek2plot  -T cgm, which produces output in CGM (Computer
       Graphics  Metafile)   format,   is   affected   by   the
       CGM_MAX_VERSION  and CGM_ENCODING environment variables.
       By default, it produces a binary-encoded version of  CGM
       version  3 format.  For backward compatibility, the ver-
       sion number may be reduced by setting CGM_MAX_VERSION to
       "2"  or  "1".   Irrespective  of version, the output CGM
       file will use the human-readable clear text encoding  if
       CGM_ENCODING  is  set  to  "clear_text".   However, only
       binary-encoded CGM files conform to the WebCGM  profile.

       tek2plot  -T  pcl,  which  produces  PCL  5  output  for
       Hewlett-Packard printers and plotters,  is  affected  by
       the  environment  variable PCL_ASSIGN_COLORS.  It should
       be set to "yes" when producing PCL 5 output for a  color
       printer  or  other color device.  This will ensure accu-
       rate color reproduction by giving the output device com-
       plete  freedom  in  assigning colors, internally, to its
       "logical pens".  If it is "no" then the device will  use
       a fixed set of colored pens, and will emulate other col-
       ors by shading.  The default is "no" because  monochrome
       PCL  5  devices, which are much more common than colored
       ones, must use shading to emulate color.

       tek2plot -T hpgl, which produces Hewlett-Packard  Graph-
       ics  Language output, is affected by several environment
       variables.  The most important  is  HPGL_VERSION,  which
       may  be  set  to  "1", "1.5", or "2" (the default).  "1"
       means that the output should  be  generic  HP-GL,  "1.5"
       means that the output should be suitable for the HP7550A
       graphics plotter and the  HP758x,  HP7595A  and  HP7596A
       drafting  plotters (HP-GL with some HP-GL/2 extensions),
       and "2" means that the output should be modern  HP-GL/2.
       If  the  version is "1" or "1.5" then the only available
       fonts will be vector fonts, and all lines will be  drawn
       with a default width (the -W option will not work).

       The position of the tek2plot -T hpgl graphics display on
       the page can be rotated 90 degrees  counterclockwise  by
       setting  the  HPGL_ROTATE environment variable to "yes".
       This is not the same as the rotation obtained  with  the
       --rotation  option,  since  it both rotates the graphics
       display and repositions its  lower  left  corner  toward
       another  corner  of  the  page.  Besides "no" and "yes",
       recognized values for HPGL_ROTATE are "0", "90",  "180",
       and  "270".   "no"  and  "yes" are equivalent to "0" and
       "90", respectively.  "180" and "270" are supported  only
       if HPGL_VERSION is "2" (the default).

       By  default, tek2plot -T hpgl will draw with a fixed set
       of pens.  Which pens are present  may  be  specified  by
       setting   the   HPGL_PENS   environment   variable.   If
       HPGL_VERSION is "1", the default value of  HPGL_PENS  is
       "1=black";  if HPGL_VERSION is "1.5" or "2", the default
       value  of  HPGL_PENS  is   "1=black:2=red:3=green:4=yel-
       low:5=blue:6=magenta:7=cyan".    The  format  should  be
       self-explanatory.  By setting HPGL_PENS you may  specify
       a  color  for  any pen in the range #1...#31.  All color
       names recognized by the X Window  System  may  be  used.
       Pen  #1  must  always  be present, though it need not be
       black.  Any other pen in the range #1...#31 may be omit-
       ted.

       If  HPGL_VERSION  is "2" then tek2plot -T hpgl will also
       be affected by the environment variable HPGL_ASSIGN_COL-
       ORS.   If its value is "yes", then tek2plot -T hpgl will
       not be restricted to the palette specified in HPGL_PENS:
       it  will  assign  colors  to "logical pens" in the range
       #1...#31, as needed.  The default value is "no"  because
       other  than  color LaserJet printers and DesignJet plot-
       ters, not many HP-GL/2 devices allow the  assignment  of
       colors to logical pens.

       The  drawing of visible white lines is supported only if
       HPGL_VERSION  is  "2"  and  the   environment   variable
       HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE  is  "yes" (the default).  If its value
       is "no" then white lines (if any),  which  are  normally
       drawn  with  pen #0, will not be drawn.  This feature is
       to accommodate older HP-GL/2 devices.  HP-GL/2 pen plot-
       ters,  for  example, do not support the use of pen #0 to
       draw visible white lines.  Some  older  HP-GL/2  devices
       may,  in  fact,  malfunction  if  asked  to  draw opaque
       objects.
