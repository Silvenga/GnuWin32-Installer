DEFAULTS
       Save path information in archive
       Save long filenames
       Save/restore extended attributes
       Save/restore file date-time created and accessed in Win95 and OS/2
       Save timestamps in the UNIX format under UNIX-like operating systems
       Don't save drive and root in path information
       Display comment ANSI sequences with built-in display handler
       Prompt before overwriting output files
       Use method 1 compression
       Use binary mode
       Use ! as list file symbol
       The "ac" command is an abbreviation for "u -u2 -jb"
       The "cc" command is an abbreviation for "y -jb"
       The "dc" command is an abbreviation for "d -jb"

       Under  Win32,  arj  uses  OEM  codepage by default.  The
       "-hy" option sets arj to use the ANSI codepage which  is
       the  Windows  graphical  environment default.  arj/Win32
       self-extracting archives should be built using the "-hy"
       option.

       To  ensure  compatibility with previous versions of arj,
       the "-2d" parameter has to be specified  when  archiving
       under UNIX.
