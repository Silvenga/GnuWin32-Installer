NAME
       ppmrough  - create PPM image of two colors with a ragged
       border between them

SYNOPSIS
       ppmrough

       [-left pixels]

       [-right pixels]

       [-top pixels]

       [-bottom pixels]

       [-width pixels]

       [-height pixels]

       [-bg rgb:##/##/##]

       [-fg rgb:##/##/##]

       [-var pixels]

       [-init seed]

       [-verbose]

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest  unique
       prefix.   You  may  use two hyphens instead of one.  You
       may separate an option name and  its  value  with  white
       space instead of an equals sign.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmrough  generates  a PPM image of the specified width,
       height, and colors.  ppmrough tiles the image into semi-
       rectangular  regions with a ragged borders between them.
       It calculates the fluctuations with the rand()  standard
       C library function.

       ppmrough writes the PPM image to Standard Output.

       The  maxval  of  the output image is 255 (You can change
       this with pnmdepth).

       Use the options -left or -right, respectively,  to  make
       vertical  borders, and -top or -bottom, respectively, to
       generate horizontal borders inside the image.   Each  of
       these  options needs an integer value pixels that deter-
       mines the average distance of the interior border to the
       related  edge  of the image.  You may combine the -left,
       -right, -top, and -bottom options to generate  an  image
       with  more  than one border.  The algorithm ensures that
       you can concatenate two images produced  with  the  same
       (i.e. -left) value without dislocations.

       You  specify  the dimensions of the generated image with
       the -width and -height options.

       Use the -bg and -fg options to set the background  (mar-
       gin)  color and the foreground (interior) color, respec-
       tively.  If you don't specify any of the -left,  -right,
       -top,  and  -bottom options, all pixels are set to fore-
       ground color.  The defaults  are  white  foreground  and
       black background.

       Use  the  -var option to control the 'raggedness' of the
       border.  The less its value is the smoother  the  border
       is.  You can initialize the pseudo-random generator with
       the -init option.

       You could use ppmrough with ppmtopgm  to  create  a  PGM
       alpha mask and use it to roughen up the edges of another
       image.


OPTIONS
       -left pixels
               Specifies the mean distance of the  border  from
              the left margin (default: no border).


       -right pixels
              Specifies  the  mean  distance of the border from
              the right margin (default: no border).


       -top pixels
              Specifies the mean distance of  the  border  from
              the top margin (default: no border).


       -bottom pixels
              Specifies  the  mean  distance of the border from
              the bottom margin (default: no border).


       -width pixels
              Specifies the width of the image (default:  100).


       -height pixels
              Specifies the height of the image (default: 100).


       -bg color
              Background color.  Specify this the same way  you
              specify a color with
                   ppmmake.  Default is black.


       -fg color
              Foreground  color.  Specify this the same way you
              specify a color with
                   ppmmake.  Default is white.


       -var pixels
               Specifies the  variance  of  the  ragged  border
              (default:  10).  Must be a positive integer.  Set
              pixels to 1 to get a straight border.


       -init seed
              Use this option to initialize  the  pseudo-random
              number  generator  (the Standard C library rand()
              function) with seed.


       -verbose
              Run ppmrough in verbose  mode.   It  reports  all
              parameters on Standard Error.
