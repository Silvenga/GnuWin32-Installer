NAME
       rpl (RePLace) - replace strings in multiple files

VERSION
       1.4.0

SYNOPSIS
       rpl   [-iwRspfdtx  [-q|-v]]  <old_str>  <new_str>  <tar-
       get_file(s)>

DESCRIPTION
       rpl replaces old_str with new_str in all  target  files.
       It  returns  the  number of strings replaced or a system
       error code (non-zero) if there is an error.

       Note that you should put strings  in  single  quotes  if
       they  contain  spaces.  You  must  also escape all shell
       meta-characters. It's a good idea to put ALL strings  in
       single quotes.

       rpl  will  attempt to maintain the owner, group and per-
       missions of your original files. For safety, rpl creates
       a temporary file and makes changes to that file. It then
       moves the temporary file over the  original  file.   rpl
       sets  the  owner, group, and permissions of the new file
       to match those of the original file.   In  some  circum-
       stances  rpl will not be able to do this (such as when a
       file is owned by the superuser but you have group  write
       permission).   In these cases rpl will warn you that the
       owner/group or permissions cannot be set and  that  file
       will  be  skipped, unless you use the force (-f) option.
       Note that the use of temp files in  predictable,  world-
       writeable  locations could lead to symlink attacks. Ide-
       ally you should set the $TMPDIR environment variable  to
       a  private directory readable and writeable only by you.
       This is especially important if running rpl as root. You
       have been warned!

       Normally,  rpl  will change the modification time of all
       files it processes like any other program. However,  you
       may instruct rpl to keep the original modification times
       using the -d (Don't alter mod-times) option.

       You can specify file suffixes to be searched  using  the
       -x  option.  Any  files  that do not match the specified
       suffixes will not be searched or modified. The -x option
       may  be  used more than once to tell rpl to search files
       with varying suffixes. For instance, say you  wanted  to
       search all of your ".html", ".htm", and ".php" files you
       would add

       " -x'.html' -x'.htm' -x'.php' "

       to your command line.  rpl would  then  skip  any  files
       that  did  not  end  with these suffixes. This is mainly
       useful when doing recursive searching (-R option).

OPTIONS
       -i     Ignore case of old_str
              rpl will match the old_str in the  searched  file
              regardless  of the case. The case of new_str will
              not be altered.

       -w     Whole words (old_str bounded by  white  space  in
              file)
              rpl  will  only match old_str if it is bounded by
              the start of a line, a space, a tab, or  the  end
              of a line.

       -q     Quiet mode (no output at all)
              Good for shell scripts, etc.

       -v     Verbose mode (lots of output)
              rpl  will  list  the name of each file and direc-
              tory, and the line numbers that contain  matches.

       -R     Search directories recursively
              rpl  will  scan  every  file  and every directory
              recursively. Without this option directories will
              be skipped.

       -x     Specify  file  suffixes to search. (e.g. ".html",
              ".c", etc.) May be used multiple times. See above
              for details.

       -p     Prompt for each file
              rpl will prompt you before scanning each file. If
              you respond 'N' or 'n' rpl will  skip  that  file
              and  move on to the next file. The default action
              if you press enter is to process the file.

       -s     Simulation mode
              rpl will scan all of the files and list the names
              of files that it would modify if a replace opera-
              tion was executed. If you  turn  on  the  verbose
              (-v)  option  as well rpl will list the line num-
              bers where the string is matched.

       -e     Honor Escapes
              rpl will honor escape sequences in old_string and
              new_string.   S"a(carriagecreturn)caresprocessed,
              "0 (newline), "
              as  well as any octal or hexidecimal ASCII codes.
              Octal ASCII codes start with a '´  and  are  com-
              prised  of  three digits [0-7] (e.g. ' 15'). Hex-
              idecimal ASCII codes start with ' x' followed  by
              two  characters  [0-f] (e.g. ' x0d'). The 'x' and
              the [a-f] may be upper or lowercase. When you use
              this  switch  you  must escape all backslash ('´)
              characters with another backslash (e.g. '\').

       -f     Force mode
              rpl will  overwrite  files  even  if  the  owner,
              group,  or  permissions  of the new file will not
              match the original. Obviously, rpl  cannot  over-
              write  files if the user does not have write per-
              mission.

       -d     Don't change modification times
              rpl will process files, but keep  their  original
              modification times.

       -t     Use $TMPDIR for temporary files
              Causes rpl to write temporary files to the direc-
              tory  specified  by  the   environment   variable
              $TMPDIR  instead of writing the temp files to the
              original file dir. (See note above about  symlink
              attacks and temp files.)

       -L     Display the software license
              This displays the software license that you agree
              to by using rpl.

       -h     Display a brief summary of options
