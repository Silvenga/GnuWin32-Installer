NAME
       pgmtopgm - copy PGM image


SYNOPSIS
       pgmtopgm


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pgmtopgm  simply  copies a PGM image from Standard Input
       to Standard Output.  This may seem an unnecessary dupli-
       cation  of cat, but remember that a PGM program can read
       a PBM image as if it were PGM.   So  pgmtopgm  can  read
       either  a  PBM  or  PGM image and produce a PGM image as
       output.

       Even that is of limited usefulness because of  the  fact
       that  almost  any  program  to  which you would feed the
       resulting PGM image could also just  take  the  original
       image  directly.   However,  sometimes you really need a
       true PGM image.

       When you know you have a PBM image and want a PGM image,
       pbmtopgm is a more general way to do that conversion.
