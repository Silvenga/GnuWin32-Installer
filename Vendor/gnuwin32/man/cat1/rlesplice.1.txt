NAME
       rlesplice  -  Splice two RLE files together horizontally
       or vertically.

SYNOPSIS
       rlesplice -{hv} [ -c ] [ -o outfile ] infile1 infile2

DESCRIPTION
       rlesplice splices two RLE images together either  verti-
       cally  or  horizontally.   If one image is smaller, then
       its background value or black is used to pad that  image
       to  equal  the larger dimension in the other image.  The
       -c flag is used to specify  whether  the  smaller  image
       should   be  centered  when  put  next  to  the  larger.
       Presently the two images must have the  same  number  of
       color  channels,  the same presence of an alpha channel,
       and the same colormap size  and  length.   The  colormap
       from the first image is used for the resultant image.
