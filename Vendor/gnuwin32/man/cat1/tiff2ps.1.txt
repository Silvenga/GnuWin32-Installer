TIFF2PS(1)                                           TIFF2PS(1)





NAME
       tiff2ps - convert a TIFF image to

SYNOPSIS
       tiff2ps [ options ] input.tif ...

DESCRIPTION
       tiff2ps  reads  TIFF  images and writes  or Encapsulated
       (EPS) on  the  standard  output.   By  default,  tiff2ps
       writes  Encapsulated   for the first image in the speci-
       fied TIFF image file.

       By default, tiff2ps will generate  that fills a  printed
       area  specified  by the TIFF tags in the input file.  If
       the file does not  contain  XResolution  or  YResolution
       tags,  then  the  printed  area  is set according to the
       image dimensions.  The -w and -h options (see below) can
       be  used  to  set  the dimensions of the printed area in
       inches; overriding any relevant TIFF tags.

       The  generated for RGB, palette, and  CMYK  images  uses
       the  colorimage  operator.  The  generated for greyscale
       and bilevel images uses the image  operator.   When  the
       colorimage operator is used,  code to emulate this oper-
       ator on older  printers is also  generated.   Note  that
       this emulation code can be very slow.

       Color  images  with associated alpha data are composited
       over a white background.

OPTIONS
       -1     Generate  Level 1 (the default).

       -2     Generate  Level 2.

       -3     Generate  Level 3. It basically allows one to use
              the  /flateDecode  filter for ZIP compressed TIFF
              images.

       -a     Generate output for all IFDs (pages) in the input
              file.

       -b     Specify  the  bottom  margin  for  the output (in
              inches). This does not affect the height  of  the
              printed image.

       -c     Center  the image in the output. This option only
              shows an effect if both the -w and the -h  option
              are given.

       -d     Set  the  initial TIFF directory to the specified
              directory number.  (NB: directories are  numbered
              starting  at  zero.)   This  option is useful for
              selecting individual pages in a multi-page  (e.g.
              facsimile) file.

       -e     Force  the  generation  of Encapsulated  (implies
              -z).

       -h     Specify the vertical size of the printed area (in
              inches).

       -H     Specify  the maximum height of image (in inches).
              Images with larger sizes will be split in several
              pages.  Option -L may be used for specifying size
              of split images overlapping.

       -i     Enable/disable pixel interpolation.  This  option
              requires  a single numeric value: zero to disable
              pixel interpolation and non-zero to enable.   The
              default is enabled.

       -L     Specify  the size of overlapping for split images
              (in inches). Used in conjunction with -H  option.

       -l     Specify  the  left  margin  for  the  output  (in
              inches). This does not affect the  width  of  the
              printed image.

       -m     Where possible render using the imagemask
               operator  instead  of  the image operator.  When
              this option is specified tiff2ps will use  image-
              mask  for  rendering  1 bit deep images.  If this
              option is not specified or if the image depth  is
              greater than 1 then the image operator is used.

       -o     Set  the initial TIFF directory to the IFD at the
              specified file offset.  This option is useful for
              selecting thumbnail images and the like which are
              hidden using the SubIFD tag.

       -p     Force the generation of (non-Encapsulated) .

       -r     Rotate image by 180 degrees.

       -s     Generate output for a single IFD  (page)  in  the
              input file.

       -w     Specify  the  horizontal size of the printed area
              (in inches).

       -x     Override resolution units specified in  the  TIFF
              as centimeters.

       -y     Override  resolution  units specified in the TIFF
              as inches.

       -z     When generating  Level 2, data is scaled so  that
              it  does  not  image  into the deadzone on a page
              (the outer margin that  the  printing  device  is
              unable  to  mark).   This  option suppresses this
              behavior.  When  Level 1 is  generated,  data  is
              imaged to the entire printed page and this option
              has no affect.

EXAMPLES
       The following generates  Level 2 for all pages of a fac-
       simile:
              tiff2ps -a2 fax.tif | lpr
       Note  also  that  if  you have version 2.6.1 or newer of
       Ghostscript then you can efficiently  preview  facsimile
       generated with the above command.

       To generate Encapsulated  for a the image at directory 2
       of an image use:
              tiff2ps -d 1 foo.tif
       (notice that directories are numbered starting at zero.)

       If  you  have  a  long image, it may be split in several
       pages:
              tiff2ps -h11 -w8.5 -H14 -L.5 foo.tif > foo.ps
       The page size is set to 8.5x11 by -w and -h options.  We
       will  accept  a small amount of vertical compression, so
       -H set to 14. Any pages between 11 and 14 inches will be
       fit  onto one page.  Pages longer than 14 inches are cut
       off at 11 and continued  on  the  next  page.  The  -L.5
       option  says  to repeat a half inch on the next page (to
       improve readability).

BUGS
       Because  does not support  the  notion  of  a  colormap,
       8-bit  palette images produce 24-bit  images.  This con-
       version results in output that is six times bigger  than
       the  original  image and which takes a long time to send
       to a printer over a serial line.  Matters are even worse
       for 4-, 2-, and 1-bit palette images.

BUGS
       Does  not handle tiled images when generating PS Level I
       output.
