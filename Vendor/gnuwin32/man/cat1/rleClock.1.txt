RLECLOCK(1)                                         RLECLOCK(1)





NAME
       rleClock - Generate a clock face in RLE format

SYNOPSIS
       rleClock [ options ] [ -o outfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  generates  an analog clock face in RLE(5)
       file format and writes it to outfile or standard output.
       The picture is a standard clock face with optional digi-
       tal representation above.  The user has control over the
       colors  of the portions of the clock face, the text, and
       the text background.  The user also has control over the
       clock  configuration:  number of ticks, scale of the big
       and little hands, the  values  of  the  big  and  little
       hands,  and the format used to generate the digital por-
       tion.

       By default, rleClock generates a standard  analog  clock
       face  displaying  the  current  time and with no digital
       portion.  This default face is transparent, that is, the
       alpha  channel  is  only  defined for the clock outline,
       tick marks, and the hands.

       On those options that expect colors, three numbers  must
       be  given after the option switch.  These are values for
       red, green, and blue on a scale  of  zero  through  255.
       Those  color  options  that are capitalized indicate the
       colors for the filled regions (optional  for  the  clock
       face  and  text  but default for the hands).  Those that
       are not capitalized are for lines that either outline or
       constitute  the  feature (the clock face is default, but
       they're optional for the hands).

OPTIONS
       -help  Prints a synopsis of the options.

       The options that control  the  value  displayed  by  the
       clock are

       -ls FLOAT
              This  specifies  the  full scale (360 degrees) of
              the little hand.  Default is 12.

       -lv FLOAT
              This specifies the  value  of  the  little  hand,
              expressed in units of the little hand full scale.
              Default is the current hour  time  on  a  12-hour
              scale.

       -bs FLOAT
              This  specifies  the  full scale (360 degrees) of
              the big hand.  Default is 60.

       -bv FLOAT
              This  specifies  the  value  of  the  big   hand,
              expressed  in  units  of the big hand full scale.
              Default is the current minute time.

       The following options manage the  display  configuration
       of the clock:

       -x INT The  INT specifies the width of the clock in pix-
              els.  Default is 128.

       -cy INT
              The INT specifies the height of  the  clock  face
              (minus  text  portion) in pixels.  The default is
              128.

       -ty INT
              The INT specifies the height  in  pixels  of  the
              text  portion of the display.  If it is zero (the
              default), no text portion is displayed.

       -t INT This specifies the number of tick marks to  place
              around the clock.  The default is 12.

       -lw INT
              This  specifies  the  line width in pixels of the
              clock face, the tick  marks,  the  optional  hand
              borders,  and  the text.  The default is one, but
              two or three give better looking clocks.

       -tf STR
              The string describes how to show the digital por-
              tion of the clock.  The rules for forming STR are
              the same as for printf format strings, that is, a
              percent  sign, optionally followed by field width
              values, followed by a key letter.  In this  case,
              the  key letter may be b, l, B, or L.  Lower case
              b means to insert the integer value  of  the  big
              hand  and upper case B means to insert the float-
              ing point value of the big hand.   Lower  case  l
              means  to  insert the integer value of the little
              hand and upper case L means to insert the  float-
              ing point value of the little hand.

       -fc R G B
              This specifies the color in red, green, and blue,
              of the clock face.

       -Fc R G B
              This specifies the color to fill  in  inside  the
              clock  face,  under the hands.  If this option is
              not supplied, the  clock  is  generated  with  no
              inside-face background (by use of the alpha chan-
              nel).

       -Hc R G B
              This specifies the color to  draw  in  the  hands
              with.

       -hc R G B
              This  specifies the color to draw the outlines of
              the hands.  If it is not given, no  outlines  are
              drawn on the edges of the hands.

       -tc R G B
              This  specifies  the  color of the text above the
              clock.  It only has effect if a text height (-ty)
              is supplied.

       -Tc R G B
              This specifies the color of a background field to
              place behind the text.  If omitted, no background
              (zero alpha channel) is drawn.

EXAMPLES
       rleClock
              Generates  a  transparent  clock face showing the
              current time and no digital representation.

       rleClock -ty 32
              Generates a current-time clock with digital  rep-
              resentation above.

       rleClock  -Fc 255 0 0 -Hc 0 0 255 -lw 3 -ty 96 -tc 0 255
       0 -Tc 128 128 128
              Generates  a clock with a red inside, white face,
              blue hands, wide lines, tall  text  field,  green
              test, and grey text background.

       rleClock  -ty  32  -bs  10 -bv 4.51 -ls 100 -lv 45.1 -tf
       "%2l.%2.2B"
              Generates  a clock with the scale of the big hand
              set to 10 and it's value at 4.51, the  scale  and
              value of the little hand as 100 and 45.1, and the
              format  for  the  digital  portion  formatted  as
              %2d.%2.2f  to print the integer little hand value
              (two spaces) and  the  floating  point  big  hand
              value.
