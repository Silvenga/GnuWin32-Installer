NAME
       into - copy into a file without destroying it

SYNOPSIS
       into [ -f ] outfile

DESCRIPTION
       Into  copies  its standard input into the specified out-
       file, but doesn't actually modify the file until it gets
       EOF.   This  is  useful  in a pipeline for putting stuff
       back in the "same place."  The outfile is not  overwrit-
       ten  if  that  would  make it zero length, unless the -f
       option is given.  That option also forces overwriting of
       the outfile even if it is not directly writable (as long
       as the directory is writable).

SEE ALSO
       pipe(2)

BUGS
       For efficiency reasons,  the  directory  containing  the
       outfile must be writable by the invoker.
       The original outfile's owner is not preserved.
