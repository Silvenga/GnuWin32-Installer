GRI_MERGE(1)                                       GRI_MERGE(1)





NAME
       gri_merge  - merge multiple Gri output files into a sin-
       gle PostScript file.

USAGE (style 1):
              gri_merge  [OPTIONS]  CxR   a.ps   b.ps   ...   >
              merged_file.ps

       Merges  the  files onto one page, in 'C' columns and 'R'
       rows.  The CxR files are given in the order of words  on
       a page.  The page is presumed to be 8.5x11in in size, as
       are all the input files, and the input files  are  sized
       to fit, and kept in natural scale.

USAGE (style 2):
              gri_merge  [OPTIONS]  xcm  ycm enlarge a.ps [b.ps
              ...] > merged_file.ps

       Where `enlarge' is a scale factor applied after  offset-
       ting `xcm' to the right and `ycm' upward.

   EXAMPLE (style 2):
              The following

       gri_merge 2 12 .5 a.ps \

              12 12 .5 b.ps \

              2 2 .5 c.ps \

              12 2 .5 d.ps > all.ps

       produces  4 panels from gri plots done using margins and
       sizes as specified in the following lines in a gri  com-
       mandfile

              set x margin 2

              set x size 15

              set y margin 2

              set y size 15

       The  OPTIONS,  available  if  your  'perl' has 'getopts'
       library, are:

       -u graylevel -- set graylevel for underlay beneath  pan-
              els, by default 0.75.

              Values   range  from  0  (black)  to  1  (white),
              although a value of precisely 1 means do NOT draw
              underlay.

       -b  graylevel -- Set value for background under individ-
              ual panels, again 0

              for black to 1 for white, with 1 meaning no draw-
              ing.

       -h     -- Print this help message and quit.
