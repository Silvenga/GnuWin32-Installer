SYNOPSIS
       file ...  -h | --help -v | --version [option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfroff is a wrapper program for the GNU text processing
       system, groff.  It transparently handles  the  mechanics
       of multiple pass groff processing, when applied to suit-
       ably marked up groff source files, such that  tables  of
       contents and body text are formatted separately, and are
       subsequently combined in the correct  order,  for  final
       publication   as  a  single  PDF  document.   A  further
       optional "style  sheet"  capability  is  provided;  this
       allows  for  the definition of content which is required
       to precede the table of contents, in the published docu-
       ment.

       For  each invocation of pdfroff, the ultimate groff out-
       put stream is post-processed by the  GhostScript  inter-
       preter, to produce a finished PDF document.

       pdfroff  makes  no  assumptions  about,  and  imposes no
       restrictions on, the use of  any  groff  macro  packages
       which the user may choose to employ, in order to achieve
       a desired document format; however, it does include spe-
       cific  built  in  support for the pdfmark macro package,
       should the user choose to employ it.   Specifically,  if
       the  pdfhref macro, defined in the pdfmark.tmac package,
       is used to define public  reference  marks,  or  dynamic
       links  to such reference marks, then pdfroff performs as
       many preformatting groff passes as  required,  up  to  a
       maximum  limit  of  four, in order to compile a document
       reference dictionary,  to  resolve  references,  and  to
       expand the dynamically defined content of links.

USAGE
       The command line is parsed in accordance with normal GNU
       conventions, but with one exception --  when  specifying
       any  short  form option (i.e., a single character option
       introduced by a  single  hyphen),  and  if  that  option
       expects  an argument, then it must be specified indepen-
       dently (i.e., it may not be appended  to  any  group  of
       other single character short form options).

       Long form option names (i.e., those introduced by a dou-
       ble hyphen) may be abbreviated to their  minimum  length
       unambiguous initial substring.

       Otherwise,  pdfroff  usage closely mirrors that of groff
       itself.  Indeed, with the exception of the -h,  -v,  and
       -T dev  short  form  options, and all long form options,
       which are parsed internally by pdfroff, all options  and
       file  name  arguments  specified on the command line are
       passed on to groff, to control the formatting of the PDF
       document.  Consequently, pdfroff accepts all options and
       arguments, as specified in groff(1), which may  also  be
       considered  as the definitive reference for all standard
       pdfroff options and argument usage.

OPTIONS
       pdfroff accepts all of the  short  form  options  (i.e.,
       those  introduced  by a single hyphen), which are avail-
       able with groff itself.  In most cases, these are simply
       passed  transparently  to groff; the following, however,
       are handled specially by pdfroff.

       -h     Same as --help; see below.

       -i     Process standard input, after all other specified
              input  files.   This  is  passed transparently to
              groff, but, if grouped  with  other  options,  it
              must be the first in the group.  Hiding it within
              a group breaks standard input processing, in  the
              multiple   pass   groff   processing  context  of
              pdfroff.

       -T dev Only -T ps is supported by  pdfroff.   Attempting
              to  specify  any  other  device causes pdfroff to
              abort.

       -v     Same as --version; see below.

       See groff(1) for a description of all other  short  form
       options,  which are transparently passed through pdfroff
       to groff.

       All long form options (i.e., those introduced by a  dou-
       ble hyphen) are interpreted locally by pdfroff; they are
       not passed on to groff, unless otherwise stated below.

       --help Causes pdfroff to display a summary  of  the  its
              usage  syntax,  and  supported  options, and then
              exit.

       --emit-ps
              Suppresses  the  final  output  conversion  step,
              causing pdfroff to emit PostScript output instead
              of PDF.  This may be useful, to capture  interme-
              diate PostScript output, when using a specialised
              postprocessor, such as gpresent for  example,  in
              place of the default GhostScript PDF writer.

       --keep-temporary-files
              Suppresses the deletion of temporary files, which
              normally occurs after pdfroff has  completed  PDF
              document  formatting;  this  may  be useful, when
              debugging formatting problems.

              See section FILES, for a description of the  tem-
              porary files used by pdfroff.

       --no-pdf-output
              May  be used with the --reference-dictionary=name
              option (described below) to eliminate  the  over-
              head  of  PDF formatting, when running pdfroff to
              create a reference dictionary, for use in a  dif-
              ferent document.

       --no-reference-dictionary
              May be used to eliminate the overhead of creating
              a reference dictionary, when it is known that the
              target  PDF  document  contains  no public refer-
              ences, created by the pdfhref macro.

       --no-toc-relocation
              May be used to eliminate the extra groff process-
              ing  pass,  which is required to generate a table
              of contents, and relocate it to the start of  the
              PDF  document, when processing any document which
              lacks an automatically generated  table  of  con-
              tents.

       --no-kill-null-pages
              While preparing for simulation of the manual col-
              lation step, which is traditionally  required  to
              relocate of a table of contents to the start of a
              document, pdfroff accumulates a number  of  empty
              page  descriptions  into  the  intermediate Post-
              Script output stream.  During the final collation
              step,  these  empty  pages are normally discarded
              from the finished document;  this  option  forces
              pdfroff to leave them in place.

       --pdf-output=name
              Specifies  the  name to be used for the resultant
              PDF document; if unspecified, the PDF  output  is
              written  to standard output.  A future version of
              pdfroff may use this option, to encode the  docu-
              ment name in a generated reference dictionary.

       --reference-dictionary=name
              Specifies  the  name to be used for the generated
              reference dictionary file;  if  unspecified,  the
              reference  dictionary  is  created in a temporary
              file, which is  deleted  when  pdfroff  completes
              processing  of the current document.  This option
              must be specified, if it is desired to  save  the
              reference   dictionary,  for  use  in  references
              placed in other PDF documents.

       --report-progress
              Causes pdfroff to display an  informational  mes-
              sage  on  standard  error,  at  the start of each
              groff processing pass.

       --stylesheet=name
              Specifies the name of an input file, to  be  used
              as a style sheet for formatting of content, which
              is to be placed before the table of contents,  in
              the formatted PDF document.

       --version
              Causes  pdfroff  to display a version identifica-
              tion message.  The entire command  line  is  then
              passed  transparently  to  groff,  in  a one pass
              operation only, in order to display  the  associ-
              ated groff version information, before exiting.

ENVIRONMENT
       The  following  environment  variables  may  be set, and
       exported, to modify the behaviour of pdfroff.

       PDFROFF_COLLATE
              Specifies the program to be used for collation of
              the finshed PDF document.

              This  collation  step  may  be  required  to move
              tables of contents to the start of  the  finished
              PDF  document,  when  formatting with traditional
              macro packages, which  print  them  at  the  end.
              However,  users should not normally need to spec-
              ify PDFROFF_COLLATE, (and indeed, are not encour-
              aged  to  do  so).   If unspecified, pdfroff uses
              sed(1) by default, which normally suffices.

              If PDFROFF_COLLATE is specified, then it must act
              as  a filter, accepting a list of file name argu-
              ments, and write its output to the stdout stream,
              whence      it      is      piped      to     the
              PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND,  to  produce   the
              finished PDF output.

              When  specifying  PDFROFF_COLLATE, it is normally
              necessary         to         also         specify
              PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES.

              PDFROFF_COLLATE is ignored, if pdfroff is invoked
              with the --no-kill-null-pages option.

       PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES
              Specifies   options   to   be   passed   to   the
              PDFROFF_COLLATE program.

              It  should  not  normally be necessary to specify
              PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES.  The internal default is
              a sed(1) script, which is intended to remove com-
              pletely blank  pages  from  the  collated  output
              stream,  and  which should be appropriate in most
              applications of pdfroff.  However, if any  alter-
              native     to    sed(1)    is    specified    for
              PDFROFF_COLLATE, then it is likely that a  corre-
              sponding     alternative     specification    for
              PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES is required.

              As    in    the    case    of    PDFROFF_COLLATE,
              PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES is ignored, if pdfroff is
              invoked with the --no-kill-null-pages option.

       PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND
              Specifies the command to be used  for  the  final
              document  conversion from PostScript intermediate
              output to PDF.  It must behave as a filter, writ-
              ing  its  output  to  the stdout stream, and must
              accept an arbitrary number  of  files  ...  argu-
              ments,  with  the  special case of - representing
              the stdin stream.

              If   unspecified,   PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND
              defaults to

                gs -dBATCH -dQUIET -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite
                -sOutputFile=-

       GROFF_TMPDIR
              Identifies the directory in which pdfroff  should
              create  temporary  files.  If GROFF_TMPDIR is not
              specified, then the  variables  TMPDIR,  TMP  and
              TEMP  are  considered in turn, as possible tempo-
              rary file repositories.  If  none  of  these  are
              set, then temporary files are created in the cur-
              rent directory.

       GROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER
              Specifies the program to be invoked, when pdfroff
              converts  groff  PostScript  output  to  PDF.  If
              PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND is specified,  then
              the  command  name it specifies is implicitly as-
              signed to GROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER, overrid-
              ing  any  explicit setting specified in the envi-
              ronment.  If GROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER is not
              specified,  then  pdfroff  searches  the  process
              PATH, looking for a program with any of the  well
              known  names  for the GhostScript interpreter; if
              no GhostScript interpreter can be found,  pdfroff
              aborts.

       GROFF_AWK_INTERPRETER
              Specifies the program to be invoked, when pdfroff
              is extracting reference dictionary entries from a
              groff    intermediate    message    stream.    If
              GROFF_AWK_INTERPRETER  is  not  specified,   then
              pdfroff  searches  the  process PATH, looking for
              any of the preferred  programs,  `gawk',  `mawk',
              `nawk' and `awk', in this order; if none of these
              are found, pdfroff issues a warning message,  and
              continue  processing;  however,  in this case, no
              reference dictionary is created.

       OSTYPE Typically defined automatically by the  operating
              system,  OSTYPE is used on Microsoft Win32/MS-DOS
              platforms   only,   to    infer    the    default
              PATH_SEPARATOR  character,  which  is  used  when
              parsing the process PATH to search  for  external
              helper programs.

       PATH_SEPARATOR
              If set, PATH_SEPARATOR overrides the default sep-
              arator character, (`:' on POSIX/UNIX systems, in-
              ferred  from  OSTYPE  on Microsoft Win32/MS-DOS),
              which is used when parsing the  process  PATH  to
              search for external helper programs.

       SHOW_PROGRESS
              If this is set to a non-empty value, then pdfroff
              always behaves as if the --report-progress option
              is specified, on the command line.

FILES
       Input  and output files for pdfroff may be named accord-
       ing to any convention of the user's choice.   Typically,
       input  files may be named according to the choice of the
       principal formatting macro package, e.g., file.ms  might
       be  an  input  file  for  formatting using the ms macros
       (s.tmac); normally, the  final  output  file  should  be
       named file.pdf.

       Temporary  files,  created by pdfroff, are placed in the
       directory specified by environment variables  (see  sec-
       tion ENVIRONMENT), and named according to the convention
       pdf$$.*, where $$ is the standard shell variable  repre-
       senting  the  process  ID of the pdfroff process itself,
       and * represents any of the extensions used  by  pdfroff
       to  identify  the  following  temporary and intermediate
       files.

       pdf$$.tmp
              A scratch pad file, used to capture reference da-
              ta emitted by groff, during the reference dictio-
              nary compilation phase.

       pdf$$.ref
              The reference dictionary, as compiled in the last
              but one pass of the reference dictionary compila-
              tion phase; (at the start of the first pass, this
              file  is  created empty; in successive passes, it
              contains the  reference  dictionary  entries,  as
              collected in the preceding pass).

              If   the  --reference-dictionary=name  option  is
              specified, this intermediate file becomes  perma-
              nent, and is named name, rather than pdf$$.ref.

       pdf$$.cmp
              Used to collect reference dictionary entries dur-
              ing the active pass of the  reference  dictionary
              compilation  phase.  At the end of any pass, when
              the content of pdf$$.cmp compares as identical to
              pdf$$.ref,  (or  the  corresponding file named by
              the  --reference-dictionary=name  option),   then
              reference  dictionary  compilation is terminated,
              and the document reference  map  is  appended  to
              this  intermediate file, for inclusion in the fi-
              nal formatting passes.

       pdf$$.tc
              An intermediate PostScript file, in which  "Table
              of Contents" entries are collected, to facilitate
              relocation before the body text, on ultimate out-
              put to the GhostScript postprocessor.

       pdf$$.ps
              An  intermediate  PostScript  file,  in which the
              body text is collected prior to  ultimate  output
              to  the  GhostScript postprocessor, in the proper
              sequence, after pdf$$.tc.

SEE ALSO
       See groff(1) for the definitive  reference  to  document
       formatting  with groff.  Since pdfroff provides a super-
       set of all groff capabilities, groff(1) may also be con-
       sidered  to  be the definitive reference to all standard
       capabilities of pdfroff, with  this  document  providing
       the reference to pdfroff's extended features.

       While  pdfroff  imposes  neither any restriction on, nor
       any requirement for, the use of any specific groff macro
       package,  a  number  of  supplied macro packages, and in
       particular   those   associated   with    the    package
       pdfmark.tmac,  are  best  suited for use with pdfroff as
       the preferred formatter.  Detailed documentation on  the
       use  of  these  packages may be found, in PDF format, in
       the reference guide "Portable Document Format Publishing
       with GNU Troff", included in the installed documentation
