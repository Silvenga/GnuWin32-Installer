       ppmimgvquant  -  palette quantifier for Pilot Image Viewer
       pgm files, version 2.0.

SYNOPSIS
       ppmimgvquant [-4] [-h] [-v] [ppmquant options]

DESCRIPTION
       ppmimgvquant just calls ppmquant(1) with the following map
       file:
            P3
            4 1
            255
              0   0   0
             85  85  85
            170 170 170
            255 255 255
       If you specify -4, then we use this map file:
            P3
            16 1
            255
              0   0   0
             17  17  17
             34  34  34
             51  51  51
             68  68  68
             85  85  85
            102 102 102
            119 119 119
            136 136 136
            153 153 153
            170 170 170
            187 187 187

            221 221 221
            238 238 238
            255 255 255
       The  ppmquant(1) output is also passed through ppmtopgm(1)
       to ensure a graymap output file.
