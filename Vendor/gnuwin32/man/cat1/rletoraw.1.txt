NAME
       rletoraw - Convert RLE file to raw RGB form.

SYNOPSIS
       rletoraw [ -a ] [ -[Ns] ] [ -r ] [ -f header-size ] [ -t
       trailer-size ] [ -l left-scanline-pad ] [  -p  scanline-
       pad [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program converts an RLE(5) image to a raw RGB form.
       The  output  file  is  normally  a  stream   of   pixels
       (RGBRGB...), in left-to-right, bottom-to-top order (this
       can be changed with the -N or -s flags).  The width  and
       height  of  the input image will be printed on the stan-
       dard error stream.

OPTIONS
       -a     If specified, an alpha channel will be written to
              the  output  file.  This is the last output chan-
              nel, unless -r is specified,  in  which  case  it
              will be the first.

       -N     If  specified,  the  output  will be written in a
              non-interleaved order.  I.e., all the red  pixels
              will be written first, then all the green pixels,
              etc.

       -s     If specified, the output will  be  written  in  a
              scanline-interleaved  order.   I.e.,  all the red
              pixels for a scanline will be  written,  followed
              by  all  the  green pixels for the scanline, etc.
              The options -N and -s are mutually exclusive.

       -r     Reverse the order of the channels in the  output.
              I.e.,  output  will  be  written  ABGR instead of
              RGBA.

       -f header-size
              A header of this many zero bytes will be  written
              to the output file.

       -t trailer-size
              A trailer of this many zero bytes will be written
              after the output file.

       -l left-scanline-pad
              The left (beginning) of  each  scanline  will  be
              padded with this many zero bytes.

       -p left-scanline-pad
              The  right  (end) of each scanline will be padded
              with this many zero bytes.

       -o outfile
              If specified, the output will be written to  this
              file.   If outfile is "-", or if it is not speci-
              fied, the output will be written to the  standard
              output stream.

       infile The input will be read from this file.  If infile
              is "-" or is not specified,  the  input  will  be
              read from the standard input stream.

BUGS
       Basically handles input files with 1 or 3 channels (plus
       alpha).  Only the first channel of  a  2  channel  image
       will be written.

       The  header,  trailer,  and  pad  options are of dubious
       utility.
