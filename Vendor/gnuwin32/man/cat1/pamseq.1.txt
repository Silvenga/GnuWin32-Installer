NAME
       pamseq  -  generate PAM image of all possible tuple val-
       ues, in sequence


SYNOPSIS
       pamseq [-tupletype tupletype] depth maxval

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest  unique
       prefix.   You may use two hyphens instead of one to des-
       ignate an option.  You may use either white space or  an
       equals sign between an option name and its value.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamseq  generates  a  PAM image of a specified depth and
       specified maxval that consists of a single row.  The row
       consists of one tuple of every possible value, in order.

       For a depth of one, the order is simple: From 0 to  max-
       val,  going  from left to right.  For higher depths, the
       highest numbered plane goes from 0 to maxval (going left
       to right) while all the other planes have value 0.  Then
       the sequence repeats except with the next highest  plane
       set to a value of 1, then 2, etc.


OPTIONS
       -tupletype
              This  is  the value of the "tuple_type" attribute
              of the created PAM image.  It can be  any  string
              up to 255 characters.




USAGE
       To  create a simple ramp of the values 0..255, for input
       to various matrix calculations, try
         pamseq 1 255
       (Before pamseq existed, pgmramp was often  pressed  into
       service for this).

       To  create  a  PPM  color map of all the possible colors
       representable with a maxval of 5, do
         pamseq 3 5 -tupletype=RGB | pamtopnm

       Again,  with  a  modern  program  based  on  the  Netpbm
       library,  you  don't need the pamtopnm because a PAM RGB
       image is equivalent to a PPM image.

       You can use such a  color  map  with  pnmremap(1)toquan-
       tizethecolorsinan  image.  With the maxval of 5 given in
       the example, you get a color map  of  the  set  of  "web
       safe"  colors as defined by Netscape.  Most web browsers
       guarantee that they can produce at least these 216  col-
       ors (215 plus black).
