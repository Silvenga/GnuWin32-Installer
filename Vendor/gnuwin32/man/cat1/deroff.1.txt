DEROFF(1)                User commands                DEROFF(1)



NAME
       deroff - remove roff, tbl, eqn, refer and pic constructs
       from documents

SYNOPSIS
       deroff [-w] [-s] [-ml] [-ms] [-mm] [-p] [file...  ]
       deroff [--word-list] [--skip-headers] [--skip-lists]
       [--pretty-print] [file...  ]
       deroff -h|--help
       deroff --version

DESCRIPTION
       deroff  reads  roff  documents and removes all nroff(1),
       troff(1),  refer(1),  tbl(1),  eqn(1)  and  pic(1)  con-
       structs.   The  resulting  text will be sent to standard
       output.   .so  and  .nx  requests  are  processed,   but
       repeated  requests  to process an already read file will
       be ignored.

OPTIONS
       -w, --word-list
              Output a word list, one word per line.

       -s, --skip-headers
              Do not output headers.  This  is  useful  if  you
              want to run text analysis tools on the output.

       -ml, --suppress-lists
              Suppress  lists.   This option is useful with -s,
              if there are many incomplete sentences in  lists.

       -ms, -mm
              These options are accepted for compatibility, but
              they are being ignored.

       -i     Ignore .so and .nx requests.

       -p, --pretty-print
              Format the output more  pretty  by  omitting  and
              adding newline characters at certain places.

       -h, --help
              Print a short usage message.

       --version
              Print the version.

EXAMPLE
       The  following  example  does  a simple spell check of a
       document:

       deroff -w document.mm | sort -u |
       comm -23 - /usr/share/words/en

RESTRICTIONS
       deroff is not a complete roff parser, so it can be  con-
       fused  by complicated constructs.  Often too much output
       is done in these cases.
