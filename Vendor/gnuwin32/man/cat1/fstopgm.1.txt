NAME
       fstopgm - convert a Usenix FaceSaver(tm) file into a PGM
       image



SYNOPSIS
       fstopgm [fsfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       fstopgm reads a Usenix FaceSaver(tm) file as  input  and
       produces a PGM image as output.

       FaceSaver(tm)  files  sometimes have rectangular pixels.
       While fstopgm won't re-scale them into square pixels for
       you,  it will give you the precise pamscale command that
       will do the job.   Because  of  this,  reading  a  Face-
       Saver(tm) image is a two-step process.  First you do:

         fstopgm > /dev/null

       This will tell you whether you need to use pamscale.

       Then use one of the following pipelines:
         fstopgm | pgmnorm
         fstopgm | pamscale -whatever | pgmnorm

       To go to PBM, you want something more like one of these:
         fstopgm | pnmenlarge 3 | pgmnorm | pamditherbw
         fstopgm | pnmenlarge 3 | pamscale <whatever> | pgmnorm | pamditherbw

       You want to enlarge when going to a bitmap because  oth-
       erwise  you lose information; but enlarging by more than
       3 does not look good.
