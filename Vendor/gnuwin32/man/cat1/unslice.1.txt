NAME
       unslice - Quickly assemble image slices

SYNOPSIS
       unslice  [  -f  ctlfile  ]  [  -y  ymax ] [ -o outfile ]
       infiles ...

DESCRIPTION
       Unslice quickly assembles a number of  horizontal  image
       strips  into  a  single output image.  A typical use for
       unslice  is  to  put  together  portions  of  an   image
       ("slices")  computed  independently into a single output
       picture.  Because unslice uses  the  "raw"  RLE  library
       calls  to read and write the images, it runs much faster
       than doing the equivalent operations with crop and comp.

       unslice  has  two  modes  of operation.  If given the -f
       flag, unslice reads a control file  telling  it  how  to
       assemble the images.  This is a text file with two deci-
       mal numbers on each line, one line for each slice to  be
       assembled  into  the  output image.  Each line gives the
       starting and stopping  scanlines  (inclusive)  for  each
       slice.   These must be in ascending order.  This is use-
       ful if the slices have excess image area that should  be
       cropped away.

       If  no control file is given, the -y flag is used.  This
       tells unslice what the maximum Y  value  of  the  output
       image  is.   Unslice reads the files in order, using the
       RLE headers to determine where to place the slices.   If
       two  slices overlap, the first scanlines from the second
       slice are thrown away.  In both cases, the  slices  must
       be in ascending order, and are expected to be of uniform
       width.

BUGS
       Unslice has really been superceded by rlepatch(1).
