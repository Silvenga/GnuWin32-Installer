EXTRACTRES(1)                                     EXTRACTRES(1)





NAME
       extractres  -  filter  to extract resources from a Post-
       Script document

SYNOPSIS
       extractres [ -m ] < document.ps > output.ps

DESCRIPTION
       Extractres extracts  resources  (fonts,  procsets,  pat-
       terns,  files,  etc) appearing in a PostScript document,
       and puts appropriate %%IncludeResource comments  in  the
       document  prologue.  The extracted resources are written
       to files with the same name  as  the  resource,  and  an
       appropriate extension. The pipeline

               extractres file.ps | includeres >out.ps

       will  move  all resources appearing in a document to the
       document prologue, removing redundant copies. The output
       file can then be put through page re-arrangement filters
       such as psnup or pstops safely.

       The -m option combines the resources of  the  same  name
       into one file; this must be used for some programs which
       download fonts a bit at a time.
