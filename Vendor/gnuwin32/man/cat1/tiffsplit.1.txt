TIFFSPLIT(1)                                       TIFFSPLIT(1)





NAME
       tiffsplit  -  split a multi-image TIFF into single-image
       TIFF files

SYNOPSIS
       tiffsplit src.tif [ prefix ]

DESCRIPTION
       tiffsplit takes a multi-directory (page) TIFF  file  and
       creates  one  or more single-directory (page) TIFF files
       from it.  The output files are given  names  created  by
       concatenating  a  prefix,  a lexically ordered suffix in
       the range [aaa-zzz], the suffix  .tif  (e.g.   xaaa.tif,
       xaab.tif,  xzzz.tif).   If  a prefix is not specified on
       the command line, the default prefix of x is used.

OPTIONS
       None.

BUGS
       Only a select set  of  ``known  tags''  is  copied  when
       splitting.
