NAME
       psidtopgm  -  convert  PostScript  'image' data to a PGM
       image


SYNOPSIS
       psidtopgm

       width height bits/sample

       [imagedata]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       psidtopgm reads the 'image' data from a PostScript  file
       as input and produces a PGM image as output.

       This program is obsoleted by pstopnm.

       What follows was written before pstopnm  existed.

       This  is  a very simple and limited program, and is here
       only because so many people have asked for it.   To  use
       it  you  have to manually extract the readhexstring data
       portion from your PostScript file,  and  then  give  the
       width,  height,  and  bits/sample  on  the command line.
       Before you attempt this, you should at  least  read  the
       description  of  the  'image' operator in the PostScript
       Language Reference Manual.

       It would probably not be too hard to write a script that
       uses  this  filter  to  read a specific variety of Post-
       Script image, but the variation is too great to  make  a
       general-purpose  reader.  Unless, of course, you want to
       write a full-fledged PostScript interpreter...
