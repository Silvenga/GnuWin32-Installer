PPM2TIFF(1)                                         PPM2TIFF(1)





NAME
       ppm2tiff  -  create  a  TIFF  file from PPM, PGM and PBM
       image files

SYNOPSIS
       ppm2tiff [ options ] [ input.ppm ] output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       ppm2tiff converts a file in the PPM, PGM and  PBM  image
       formats  to TIFF.  By default, the TIFF image is created
       with data samples packed  (PlanarConfiguration=1),  com-
       pressed with the Packbits algorithm (Compression=32773),
       and with each strip no  more  than  8  kilobytes.  These
       characteristics  can be overridden, or explicitly speci-
       fied with the options described below

       If the PPM file contains greyscale data, then the Photo-
       metricInterpretation  tag  is  set  to 1 (min-is-black),
       otherwise it is set to 2 (RGB).

       If no  PPM  file  is  specified  on  the  command  line,
       ppm2tiff will read from the standard input.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify  a compression scheme to use when writing
              image data: none for no compression, packbits for
              PackBits  compression  (will be used by default),
              lzw for Lempel-Ziv & Welch compression, jpeg  for
              baseline  JPEG  compression, zip for Deflate com-
              pression, g3 for CCITT Group 3 (T.4) compression,
              and g4 for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) compression.

       -r     Write  data  with  a specified number of rows per
              strip; by default the  number  of  rows/strip  is
              selected  so  that  each strip is approximately 8
              kilobytes.

       -R     Mark the resultant image to have the specified  X
              and Y resolution (in dots/inch).
