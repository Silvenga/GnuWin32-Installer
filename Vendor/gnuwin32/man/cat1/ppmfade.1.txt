NAME
       ppmfade  - generate a transition between two image files
       using special effects


SYNOPSIS
       ppmfade      [-f      first.ppm]      [-l      last.ppm]
       [-mix|-spread|-shift|          -relief|-oil|-edge|-bent-
       ley|-block] [-base name]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmfadegenerates a transition between either  two  input
       images  or  between  one input image and black.  You can
       use the 30  intermediate  images  generated  to  show  a
       smooth  transition  between  segments  of  a movie.  The
       input and output images are in the PPM format.   If  you
       specify  both input images, they should both be the same
       size.  If you want to fade from black to an image, spec-
       ify  only  the  last image.  If you want to fade from an
       image to black, specify only the first  image.   ppmfade
       names  the  resulting  image  files base.nnnn.ppm, where
       nnnn is a number varying between 0001 and 0030 and  base
       is  what  you specify with via the -base option (default
       fade).

       Another way to  convert  by  steps  from  one  image  to
       another is morphing.  You can use xmorph to do that.


OPTIONS
       -f first.ppm
              This is the image file (PPM format) to be used at
              the beginning of the transition.   If  you  don't
              specify this, the fade will start from black.


       -l last.ppm
              This is the image file (PPM format) to be used at
              the ending of the transition.  If you don't spec-
              ify this, the fade will end with black.


       -mix   The  two images are superimposed with the bright-
              ness of the first image decreasing from  full  to
              none  and  the  brightness  of  the  final  image
              increasing from none to full.  The transition  is
              quadratic in brightness with faster transition in
              the beginning and slower at the end.


       -spread
              The pixels in  the  first  image  will  be  moved
              (spread)  further and further from their original
              location and then moved into the proper  location
              in  the final image.  This is the default transi-
              tion.


       -shift The pixels in the first  image  will  be  shifted
              further   and  further  horizontally  from  their
              original location and then moved into the  proper
              location in the final image.


       -relief
              The  first  image  is faded to a Laplacian relief
              filtered version of the  first  image.   This  is
              then faded to a Laplacian relief filtered version
              of the second image  and  finally  faded  to  the
              final image.


       -oil   The  first  image  is  faded to an 'oil transfer'
              version of the first image.  This is  then  faded
              to  an 'oil transfer' version of the second image
              and finally faded to the final image.


       -edge  The first image is faded to an edge detected ver-
              sion  of  the first image.  This is then faded to
              an edge detected version of the second image  and
              finally faded to the final image.


       -bentley
               The  first  image is faded to a 'Bentley Effect'
              version of the first image.  This is  then  faded
              to a 'Bentley Effect' version of the second image
              and finally faded to the final image.


       -block The first image is  defocused  to  small  blocks.
              The  small  blocks are converted to match a defo-
              cused version of the last image.  The block  ver-
              sion  of  the  last  image is then focused to the
              final image.


       -base name
              This forms  part  of  the  output  filenames,  as
              described above.




EXAMPLES
       ppmfade -f teapot.ppm -l pyr.ppm

       Fade from teapot.ppm to pyr.ppm generating fade.0001.ppm
       to fade.0030.ppm using the 'spread' transition.

       ppmfade -l teapot.ppm

       Fade from black to teapot.ppm  generating  fade.0001.ppm
       to fade.0030.ppm.

       ppmfade -f teapot.ppm -base end

       Fade from teapot.ppm to black generating end.0001.ppm to
       end.0030.ppm.
