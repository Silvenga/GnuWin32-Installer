NAME
       imgvtopnm  -  Pilot Image Viewer pdb to PGM/PBM converter,
       version 2.0.

SYNOPSIS
       imgvtopnm [-h] [-v] [-{p|r}] [-n notefile] [in [out]]

DESCRIPTION
       Imgvtopnm is a filter for converting  Pilot  Image  Viewer
       pdb  files  to  Portable  Graymaps  or  Portable  Bitmaps;
       grayscale pdb files will be converted  to  PGM  files  and
       monochrome  pdb  files  will  be  converted  to PBM files.
       Notes attached to images may, optionally, be extracted  as
       well.   Both  compressed  and uncompressed images are sup-
       ported.

       If you want to know what  kind  of  image  (monochrome  or
       grayscale) a pdb file holds, use imgvinfo(1).

OPTIONS
       -h     Display a short usage message and exit.

       -v     Display the version and exit.

       -p     Produce a plain (or text) format output file.

       -r     Produce a raw (or binary) format output file.

       -n notefile

              age note is ignored by default.

       in     The input file.  The standard input is read by  de-

       out    The output file.  The standard output is written by
              default.
