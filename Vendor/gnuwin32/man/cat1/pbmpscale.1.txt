NAME
       pbmpscale - enlarge a PBM image with edge smoothing


SYNOPSIS
       pbmpscale N [pbmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmpscale  reads a PBM image as input, and outputs a PBM
       image enlarged N times.  pbmpscale does this enlargement
       by  pixel replication, with some additional smoothing of
       corners and edges.

NOTES
       pbmpscale works best for enlargements of 2. Enlargements
       greater than 2 should be done by as many enlargements of
       2 as possible, followed by an enlargement by the remain-
       ing factor.
