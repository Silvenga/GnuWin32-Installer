TIFF2RGBA(1)                                       TIFF2RGBA(1)





NAME
       tiff2rgba - convert a TIFF image to RGBA color space

SYNOPSIS
       tiff2rgba [ options ] input.tif output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       Tiff2rgba converts a wide variety of TIFF images into an
       RGBA TIFF image.  This includes the ability to translate
       different  color  spaces  and photometric interpretation
       into RGBA, support for alpha blending,  and  translation
       of many different bit depths into a 32bit RGBA image.

       Internally  this  program is implemented using the TIFF-
       ReadRGBAImage() function, and it suffers any limitations
       of  that  image.   This includes limited support for > 8
       BitsPerSample images, and flaws with some esoteric  com-
       binations  of BitsPerSample, photometric interpretation,
       block organization and planar configuration.

       The generated images are stripped images with four  sam-
       ples per pixel (red, green, blue and alpha) or if the -n
       flag is used, three samples per pixel (red,  green,  and
       blue).   The resulting images are always planar configu-
       ration contiguous.  For this reason, this program  is  a
       useful  utility  for  transform exotic TIFF files into a
       form ingestible by almost any TIFF supporting  software.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify  a compression scheme to use when writing
              image data:  -c  none  for  no  compression  (the
              default),  -c  packbits for the PackBits compres-
              sion algorithm, -c zip for the  Deflate  compres-
              sion  algorithm, -c jpeg for the JPEG compression
              algorithm, and -c lzw for Lempel-Ziv & Welch.

       -r     Write data with a specified number  of  rows  per
              strip;  by  default  the  number of rows/strip is
              selected so that each strip  is  approximately  8
              kilobytes.

       -b     Process  the  image  one  block (strip/tile) at a
              time instead of by reading the whole  image  into
              memory  at  once.  This may be necessary for very
              large images on systems with limited RAM.

       -n     Drop the alpha component from  the  output  file,
              producing  a  pure RGB file.  Currently this does
              not work if the -b flag is also in effect.
