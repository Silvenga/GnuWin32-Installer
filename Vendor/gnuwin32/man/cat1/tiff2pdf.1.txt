NAME
       tiff2pdf - convert a TIFF image to a PDF document

SYNOPSIS
       tiff2pdf [ options ] input.tiff

DESCRIPTION
       tiff2pdf opens a TIFF image and writes a PDF document to
       standard output.

       The program converts one TIFF  file  to  one  PDF  file,
       including  multiple  page  TIFF files, tiled TIFF files,
       black and white. grayscale, and color  TIFF  files  that
       contain  data  of  TIFF  photometric  interpretations of
       bilevel, grayscale, RGB, YCbCr, CMYK separation, and ICC
       L*a*b* as supported by libtiff and PDF.

       If  you have multiple TIFF files to convert into one PDF
       file then use tiffcp or other program to concatenate the
       files into a multiple page TIFF file.  If the input TIFF
       file is of huge dimensions (greater  than  10000  pixels
       height or width) convert the input image to a tiled TIFF
       if it is not already.

       The standard output is standard output.  Set the  output
       file name with the -ooutput.pdf option.

       All  black  and white files are compressed into a single
       strip CCITT G4 Fax compressed PDF, unless  tiled,  where
       tiled  black  and white images are compressed into tiled
       CCITT G4 Fax compressed PDF, libtiff  CCITT  support  is
       assumed.

       Color  and grayscale data can be compressed using either
       JPEG compression, ITU-T T.81, or Zip/Deflate  LZ77  com-
       pression.   Set  the compression type using the -j or -z
       options.  JPEG compression support requires that libtiff
       be  configured  with  JPEG support, and Zip/Deflate com-
       pression support requires  that  libtiff  be  configured
       with  Zip  support,  in tiffconf.h.  Use only one or the
       other of -j and -z.

       If the input TIFF contains single  strip  CCITT  G4  Fax
       compressed  information, then that is written to the PDF
       file without transcoding, unless the options of no  com-
       pression and no passthrough are set, -d and -n.

       If   the  input  TIFF  contains  JPEG  or  single  strip
       Zip/Deflate compressed information, and they are config-
       ured,  then  that  is  written  to  the PDF file without
       transcoding, unless the options of no compression and no
       passthrough are set.

       The  default  page  size  upon  which  the TIFF image is
       placed is determined by the resolution and extent of the
       image  data.   Default values for the TIFF image resolu-
       tion can be set using the -x and -y options.   The  page
       size  can  be set using the -p option for paper size, or
       -w and -l for paper width and length, then each page  of
       the  TIFF  image  is centered on its page.  The distance
       unit for default resolution and page  width  and  length
       can be set by the -u option, the default unit is inch.

       Various  items of the output document information can be
       set with the -e, -c, -a, -t, -s, and -k  options.   Set-
       ting  the  argument  of  the option to "" for these tags
       causes the relevant document information field to be not
       written.  Some of the document information values other-
       wise get their information from the  input  TIFF  image,
       the  software, author, document name, and image descrip-
       tion.

       from input.tiff.

              tiff2pdf -o output.pdf input.tiff

       The following example would  generate  PDF  output  from
       input.tiff and write it to standard output.

              tiff2pdf input.tiff

       The following example would generate the file output.pdf
