DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmtosgi  reads a PNM image as input and produces an SGI
       image file as output.  The SGI image  will  be  2-dimen-
       sional  (1  channel) for PBM and PGM input, and 3-dimen-
       sional (3 channels) for PPM.


OPTIONS
       -verbatim
              Write an uncompressed file.

       -rle (default)
              Write a compressed (run length encoded) file.

       -imagename name
              Write the string 'name' into the imagename  field
              of  the header.  The name string is limited to 79
              characters.  If no name is given, pnmtosgi writes
              'no name' into this field.
