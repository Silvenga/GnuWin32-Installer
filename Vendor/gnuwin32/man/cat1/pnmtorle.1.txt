NAME
       pnmtorle - convert a Netpbm image file into an RLE image
       file.

SYNOPSIS
       pnmtorle

       [-h] [-v] [-a] [-o outfile] [pnmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       This program converts Netpbm image files into  Utah  RLE
       image  files.   You  can  include an alpha mask.  If the
       input is a multiple image file, the output  consists  of
       several concatenated RLE images.

       The  RLE  file will contain either a three channel color
       image (24 bits) or a single channel grayscale  image  (8
       bits) depending upon the pnm file depth.  If a converted
       ppm is displayed on an 8 bit display, the image must  be
       dithered.   In  order  to produce a better looking image
       (on 8 bit displays), it is recommended that the image be
       quantizing (to 8 bit mapped color) prior to its display.
       This may be done by piping the output  of  this  program
       into  the  Utah  mcut or rlequant utilities.  We show an
       example of this later.


OPTIONS
       -v     This option will cause  pnmtorle  to  operate  in
              verbose  mode.  The header information is written
              to 'stderr'.  Actually, there is not much  header
              information  stored  in  a  Netpbm  file, so this
              information is minimal.

       -h     This option allows the header of the Netpbm image
              to  be  dumped to 'stderr' without converting the
              file.  It is equivalent to using  the  -v  option
              except that no file conversion takes place.

       -a     This  option  causes pnmtorle to include an alpha
              channel in the output image.  The  alpha  channel
              is  based  on  the  image:   Wherever  a pixel is
              black, the corresponding alpha value is transpar-
              ent.   Everywhere  else, the alpha value is fully
              opaque.


       -o outfile
              If you specify this option, pnmtorle  writes  the
              output  to  this  file.   If  outfile is - or you
              don't specify -o, pnmtorle writes the  output  to
              Standard Output.


       pnmfile
              The name of the Netpbm image data file to be con-
              verted.  If  not  specified,  standard  input  is
              assumed.



EXAMPLES
          pnmtorle -v file.ppm -o file.rle

       While  running  in verbose mode, convert file.ppm to RLE
       format and store resulting data in file.rle.

          pnmtorle -h file.pgm

       Dump the header information of the  Netpbm  file  called
       file.pgm.
