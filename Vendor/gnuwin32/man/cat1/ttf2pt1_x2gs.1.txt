NAME
       ttf2pt1_x2gs - font installer for Ghostscript

SYNOPSIS
       ttf2pt1_x2gs [config-file]

DESCRIPTION
       The fonts generated with ttf2pt1 work fine with
       Ghostscript by themselves. The script `x2gs' (or
       `ttf2pt1_x2gs' when installed into a public directory,
       to avoid name conflicts with other programs) links the
       font files from the X11 direcotry into the Ghostscript
       directory and automatically creates the description file
       (Fontmap) in Ghostscript format.

       If the configuration file is not specified as an
       argument then the file `convert.cfg' in the current
       directory is used, just like the `convert' script does.
       Indeed, this configuration file is used for both
       scripts.

       The Ghostscript-related parameters in the configuration
       file are:

       DSTDIR - the X11 font directory used by `x2gs' as the
       source of the fonts. This parameter is common with the
       X11 configuration.

       GSDIR - the base directory of Ghostsript. If this
       parameter is set to an empty string then `convert' won't
       call `x2gs'. So if you want to get only the X11 fonts
       installed then set this parameter to an empty string.
       This directory may vary on various system, so please
       check your system and set this value accordingly before
       running the script.

       GSFONTDIR - the font directory of Ghostscript. In the
       standard Ghostscript installation it's a subdirectory of
       GSDIR but some systems may use completely different
       directories.

       GSCONFDIR - the configuration subdirectory of
       Ghostscript that contains the Fontmap file.

       INSTALLFONTMAP - if the value is set to YES then install
       the entries for the new fonts right into the main
       Fontmap file. Otherwise just leave the file Fontmap.ttf
       in the Ghostscript configuration directory.

       After preparing the configuration file run the script.
       It symbolicaly links all the font files and creates the
       description file Fontmap.ttf in GSCONDFIR. After that
       there are two choices.

       If the option INSTALLFONTMAP was set to YES then the
       font descriptions are also automatically installed into
       the master Fontmap file. The script is clever enough to
       detect if it was run multiple times with the same
       directories and if so it replaces the old Fontmap
       entries with the new ones instead of just accumulating
       all of them. You may also run it multiple times for
       multiple X11 directories and all the results will be
       properly collected in the Fontmap.  But it's your
       responsibility to watch that the names of the font files
       don't overlap. If the X11 font directory gets renamed
       then you have to remove its font entries from the
       Fontmap and only after that re-run `x2gs' for the new
       directory.

       On the other hand if the option INSTALLFONTMAP was set
       to NO then go to the GSCONFDIR directory and insert the
       contents of Fontmap.ttf into the Fontmap file manually.
       This step may be left manual to make the installation a
       little bit more safe.

       After that you may also want to redefine some of the
       aliases in Fontmap to refer to the newly installed
       fonts.  But the redefinition of the aliases may be
       dangerous if the width of characters in the new font
       will be different from the old font.  Alas, there is no
       visible solution of this problem yet.
