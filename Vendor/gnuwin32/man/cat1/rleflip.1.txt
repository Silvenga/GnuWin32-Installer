RLEFLIP(1)                                           RLEFLIP(1)





NAME
       rleflip - Invert, reflect or rotate an image.

SYNOPSIS
       rleflip -{rlhv} [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rleflip  inverts,  reflects an image; or rotates left or
       right by 90 degrees.  The picture's origin  remains  the
       same.   If no input file is specified, the image is read
       from standard input.  For rotations  of  other  than  90
       degrees, use fant(1).

OPTIONS
       Exactly one of the following flags must be given:

       -r     Rotate the image 90 degrees to the right

       -l     Rotate the image 90 degrees to the left

       -h     Reflect the image horizontally

       -v     Flip the image vertically

       -o outfile
              If  specified, the output will be written to this
              file.  If outfile is "-", or if it is not  speci-
              fied,  the output will be written to the standard
              output stream.
