NAME
       psmandup - print duplex on non duplex printers

SYNOPSIS
       psmandup FILE

DESCRIPTION
       Tries  to  produce  a  version of the PostScript FILE to
       print in manual Duplex.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -v, --version
              display version information and exit

       -q, --quiet
              don't print informational messages

       -o, --output=FILE
              save result in FILE.  If FILE  is  `-',  send  to
              stdout

       -n, --no-fix
              don't call fixps to fix PS problems in FILE

       -f, --front
              output  only the front pages (recto) on the regu-
              lar tray

       -b, --back
              output only the back pages (verso) on the  manual
              feed tray

       Produced  output  is meant for PS level 2 printers which
       don't support Duplex printing, but support Manual  Feed.
       Once the first set of pages is printed (odd pages), man-
       ual feed is asked: introduce the odd pages to print  the
       even pages on the other side.

       Because  there  is usually a short time out for manually
       fed jobs, you should really be next to the printer.   If
       ever  the  time  out  expired, use the option -b to send
       only the missing part.

       Environment variables  FIXPS,  PSSELECT  and  PSSET,  if
       defined, are used to find the tools.
