NAME
       rlehdr - Prints the header of an RLE file

SYNOPSIS
       rlehdr [ -b ] [ -ccomment-names ] [ -d ] [ -m ] [ -v ] [
       files ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program prints the header  of  RLE(5)  files  in  a
       human  readable form.  If the optional files argument is
       not supplied, input is read from standard input.

OPTIONS
       -b     Print the information in a "brief" one-line form.
              The form of the output line is
              name: [l,b]+[xs,ys]xnc+A, BG=color, map=NxL, (C)
              Where  [l,b]  is  the  position of the lower-left
              corner of the image, [xs,ys] is the size  of  the
              image  in  pixels,  nc  is the number of channels
              saved, +A is  present  if  an  alpha  channel  is
              saved.   BG=  or  OV=  indicate that a background
              color was saved;  OV=  means  that  the  existing
              background is not cleared to the background color
              before the image is read (this  was  used  for  a
              cheap form of compositing, but is basically obso-
              lete now).  color is the saved background  color.
              The  map=  entry  will be present only if a color
              map was saved; N is the number of channels in the
              color  map  and  L  is  the  length  of  the map.
              Finally (C) is appended  if  there  are  comments
              present.

       -c comment-names
              If  a  comment  identified by any of the words in
              the comma-separated list comment-names is present
              in  the  input  file,  its  first  line  will  be
              printed.  Each name is tried, in turn,  and  only
              the  first  match  is  printed.   If  no match is
              found, but comments  are  present,  (C)  will  be
              printed.  The -c flag implies -b.

       -d     Dump a very verbose version of the image contents
              as text to the standard error output stream.

       -m     Print out the color map information.   -v  Prints
              the  raster  toolkit version and patch level.  No
              input files will be processed if this  option  is
              given.

EXAMPLES
       rlehdr image.rle
              Print  the  header  information for all images in
              the file image.rle.

       rlehdr -m image.rle
              Also print the color  map  contents,  if  one  is
              present.

       rlehdr -b *.rle
              Print one line summaries of all the images in the
              directory.

       rlehdr -c title,TITLE *.rle
              Print one line summaries of all the  images,  and
              print the title of any that have a title comment.
