PAINTTORLE(1)                                     PAINTTORLE(1)





NAME
       painttorle - Convert MacPaint images to RLE format.

SYNOPSIS
       painttorle [ -c [ red ] [ green ] [ blue ] [ alpha ] ] [
       -r ] [ -o outfile.rle ] [ infile.paint ]

DESCRIPTION
       Painttorle converts a file from MacPaint format into RLE
       format.   Because MacPaint and RLE disagree on which end
       is up, the output should be sent through rleflip to pre-
       serve orientation.

OPTIONS
       -c[red] [green] [blue] [alpha]
              Allows  the  color  values  to  be specified (the
              default is 255).

       -r     Invert the color of the MacPaint pixels  (reverse
              video).

       infile.paint
              The input paint data will be read from this file,
              otherwise, input will be taken from stdin.

       -o outfile.rle
              If specified, output  will  be  written  to  this
              file, otherwise it will go to stdout.
