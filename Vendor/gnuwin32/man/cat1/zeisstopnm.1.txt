NAME
       zeisstopnm - convert a Zeiss confocal file to PNM


SYNOPSIS
       zeisstopnm

       [-pgm | -ppm]

       [zeissfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       zeisstopnm reads a Zeiss confocal file as input and pro-
       duces a PNM image as output.

       By default, the exact type of the output depends on  the
       input  file:  If it's grayscale a PGM image; otherwise a
       PPM.  The program tells you which type  it  is  writing.
       You  can  override  the  default  with the -pgm and -ppm
       options.


OPTIONS
       -pgm   Force the output to be in PGM format.


       -ppm   Force the output to be in PPM format.
