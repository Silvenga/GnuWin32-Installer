NAME
       ngettext - translate message and choose plural form

SYNOPSIS
       ngettext [OPTION] [TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID MSGID-PLURAL COUNT

DESCRIPTION
       The  ngettext program translates a natural language mes-
       sage into the user's language, by looking up the  trans-
       lation in a message catalog, and chooses the appropriate
       plural form, which depends on the number COUNT  and  the
       language  of  the  message catalog where the translation
       was found.

       Display native language translation of a textual message
       whose grammatical form depends on a number.

       -d, --domain=TEXTDOMAIN
              retrieve translated message from TEXTDOMAIN

       -e     enable expansion of some escape sequences

       -E     (ignored for compatibility)

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              display version information and exit

       [TEXTDOMAIN]
              retrieve translated message from TEXTDOMAIN

       MSGID MSGID-PLURAL
              translate  MSGID  (singular) / MSGID-PLURAL (plu-
              ral)

       COUNT  choose singular/plural form based on this value

       If the TEXTDOMAIN parameter is not given, the domain  is
       determined from the environment variable TEXTDOMAIN.  If
       the message catalog is not found in the  regular  direc-
       tory,  another  location can be specified with the envi-
       ronment variable TEXTDOMAINDIR.  Standard search  direc-
       tory: c:/progra~1/Gettext/share/locale
