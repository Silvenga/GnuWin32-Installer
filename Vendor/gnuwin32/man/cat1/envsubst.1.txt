NAME
       envsubst  -  substitutes  environment variables in shell
       format strings

SYNOPSIS
       envsubst [OPTION] [SHELL-FORMAT]

DESCRIPTION
       Substitutes the values of environment variables.

   Operation mode:
       -v, --variables
              output the variables occurring in SHELL-FORMAT

   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit

       In normal operation mode, standard input  is  copied  to
       standard  output,  with  references to environment vari-
       ables  of  the  form  $VARIABLE  or  ${VARIABLE}   being
       replaced with the corresponding values.  If a SHELL-FOR-
       MAT is given, only those environment variables that  are
       referenced  in  SHELL-FORMAT  are substituted; otherwise
       all environment variables references occurring in  stan-
       dard input are substituted.

       When --variables is used, standard input is ignored, and
       the output consists of the  environment  variables  that
       are referenced in SHELL-FORMAT, one per line.
