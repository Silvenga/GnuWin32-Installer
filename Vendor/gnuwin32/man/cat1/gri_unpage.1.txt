NAME
       gri_unpage  -  split  a  multi-page Gri output file into
       separate files.

DESCRIPTION
       gri_unpage is used to split a multi-page Gri output file
       (in  which  the new page command was used) into separate
       PostScript files, one for each page.

USAGE
       # gri_unpage name.ps

              Creates files name-1.ps, name-2.ps, etc, one  for
              each page of name.ps.


       OPTIONS:
              The   OPTIONS,   available  if  your  'perl'  has
              'getopts' library, are:

       -l -- sets the bounding box to letter page size.

              By default, the bounding box  size  is  extracted
              from the original file, and is used for all newly
              created files.



       BUGS:

       1. Bounding box is always the same  size  (grabbed  from
       the original).

       2.  Assumes  that  all  Gri  fonts are used even if they
       aren't.
