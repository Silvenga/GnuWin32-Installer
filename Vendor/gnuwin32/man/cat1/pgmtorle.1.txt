PGMTORLE(1)                                         PGMTORLE(1)





NAME
       pgmtorle  - convert a pbmplus/pgm image file into an RLE
       image file.

SYNOPSIS
       pgmtorle [ -h ] [ -v ] [ -a ] [ -o outfile ] [  filename
       ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  converts  PBMPLUS  grayscale  (pgm) image
       files into Utah RLE(5) image files.   PBMPLUS/pgm  image
       files contain the image dimensions and 8-bit pixels with
       no matte or alpha data.  When converting to an RLE file,
       the  alpha  channel may optionally be computed.  The RLE
       file will contain a "grayscale" image (8 bits)  with  no
       colormap.  The origins of PBMPLUS and Utah RLE files are
       in the upper left and lower left  corners  respectively,
       so  this program automatically "flips" the image.  These
       RLE files may then be viewed using any RLE image viewer.


OPTIONS
       -v     This  option  will  cause  pgmtorle to operate in
              verbose mode.  The header information is  written
              to  "stderr".  Actually, there is not much header
              information stored in  a  PBMPLUS  file  so  this
              information is minimal.

       -h     This  option  allows  the  header  of the PBMPLUS
              image to be dumped to "stderr" without converting
              the  file.   It  is  equivalent  to  using the -v
              option  except  that  no  file  conversion  takes
              place.

       -a     This  option  will  cause  pgmtorle  to  use  the
              grayscale data to compute an alpha channel in the
              resulting  RLE  file.  For any non-zero grayscale
              data, the alpha channel will contain a  value  of
              255.   The  resulting RLE image file will contain
              one color channel and one alpha channel.

       -o outfile
              If specified, the output will be written to  this
              file.   If outfile is "-", or if it is not speci-
              fied, the output will be written to the  standard
              output stream.

       infile.pgm
              The  name  of  the  PBMPLUS image data file to be
              converted.  This file must end in  ".pgm".   How-
              ever,  it  is  not necessary to supply the ".pgm"
              extension as it will be  added  to  the  supplied
              name if not already there.

EXAMPLES
       pgmtorle -v test.pgm -o test.rle
              While  running  in verbose mode, convert test.pgm
              to  RLE  format  and  store  resulting  data   in
              test.rle.

       pgmtorle -h test
              Dump  the  header information of the PBMPLUS file
              called test.pgm.
