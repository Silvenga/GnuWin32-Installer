NAME
       repos - reposition an RLE image

SYNOPSIS
       repos [ -p xpos ypos ] [ -P xinc yinc ] [ -o outfile ] [
       infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       repos repositions an RLE image.  Repos just changes  the
       coordinates  stored  in  the RLE header (see RLE(5)), no
       modification is made to the image itself.

OPTIONS
       If neither of the following flags are specified, -p 0  0
       is assumed.

       -p xpos ypos
              Reposition  the image to the absolute coordinates
              xpos ypos.

       -P xinc yinc
              Move the image by xinc yinc pixels from where  it
              currently is (relative movement).

       infile The input will be read from this file, otherwise,
              input will be taken from stdin.

       -o outfile
              If specified, output  will  be  written  to  this
              file, otherwise it will go to stdout.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Repos  does  not allow the image origin to have negative
       coordinates.
