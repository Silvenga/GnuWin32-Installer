NAME
       pamoil - turn a PAM image into an oil painting


SYNOPSIS
       pamoil

       [-n N]

       [pamfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamoil  reads  a  Netpbm image as input and does an 'oil
       transfer', and writes the same type of Netpbm  image  as
       output.

       The oil transfer is described in 'Beyond Photography' by
       Holzmann, chapter 4, photo 7.  It's a sort of  localized
       smearing.

       The  smearing works like this: First, assume a grayscale
       image.  For each pixel in the image, pamoil looks  at  a
       square  neighborhood  around it.  pamoil determines what
       is the most common pixel intensity in the  neighborhood,
       and  puts  a  pixel of that intensity into the output in
       the same position as the input pixel.

       For color images, or any arbitrary multi-channel  image,
       pamoil computes each channel (e.g. red, green, and blue)
       separately the same way as the grayscale case above.

       At the edges of the image, where the  regular  neighbor-
       hood  would run off the edge of the image, pamoil uses a
       clipped neighborhood.


OPTIONS
       -n size
              This is the size of the neighborhood used in  the
              smearing.   The  neighborhood is this many pixels
              in all four directions.

              The default is 3.
