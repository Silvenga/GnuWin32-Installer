NAME
       lpr - Spool files to a printer

SYNOPSIS
       lpr [-D] [-d device ] [-h] [-l] [-P device ]

DESCRIPTION
       lpr  spools  a  file to the specified printer device. No
       formatting is done -- data is sent "raw". This  is  use-
       ful,  for  example,  for  sending  Postscript  data to a
       Postscript printer.

OPTIONS
       -D     enables some debugging output.

       -d device
              specifies the device to which to send the output.

       -h     does  nothing  and  is accepted for compatibility
              only.

       -l     disables CR/LF translation. Normally,  files  are
              converted   to   DOS/Windows-style  line  endings
              (CR+LF) during the spooling process. Some drivers
              appear  to  require  this translation, while most
              don't seem to care. Including this option on  the
              lpr  command line disables any such translations.

       -P device
              an alias for -d.

DEVICES
       A    device    name    may     be     a     UNC     path
       (\\server_name\printer_name), a reserved DOS device name
       (e.g., prn, lpt1), or a local port name that  is  mapped
       to  a  printer  share.  Note that forward slashes may be
       used     in     a     UNC     path      also      (e.g.,
       //server_name/printer_name).

ENVIRONMENT
       A  default  device  name may be specified in the PRINTER
       environment variable. Specifying a device via a -d or -P
       will override the environment variable setting.

NOTES
       Make sure that the default paper size setting is correct
       for the program that is formatting the page.  For  exam-
       ple, for enscript, make sure the DefaultMedia setting is
       correct in /etc/enscript.cfg. If this setting is  incor-
       rect,  it is possible that no output at all will be pro-
       duced by the printer. This is not an lpr issue.
