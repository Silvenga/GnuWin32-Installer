NAME
       pbmtoepsi - convert a PBM image to an encapsulated Post-
       Script style preview bitmap


SYNOPSIS
       pbmtoepsi [-dpi=N[xN]] [-bbonly] [pbmfile]

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest  unique
       prefix.   You  may  use two hyphens instead of one.  You
       may separate an option name and  its  value  with  white
       space instead of an equals sign.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       Reads  a  PBM  image as input.  Produces an encapsulated
       Postscript style bitmap as output.  The output is not  a
       stand  alone  postscript file, it is only a preview bit-
       map, which can be included in an encapsulated PostScript
       file.

       pbmtoepsi assumes the PBM input describes a whole output
       page, with one pixel on the page  corresponding  to  one
       PBM  pixel.   It  detects white borders in the image and
       generates Postscript output that contains a Bounding Box
       statement  to  describe  the  location  of the principal
       image (the image excluding the  white  borders)  on  the
       page and thus does not include the borders in the raster
       part of the Postscript output.

       There is no epsitopbm tool - this transformation is  one
       way.


OPTIONS
       -dpi=N[xN]

              This  option specifies the resolution in dots per
              inch of the
                   ultimate output device.   You  must  specify
              this because the
                   Bounding  Box statement defines the bounding
              box in absolute
                   distances, not in pixels.  pbmtoepsi assumes
              in
                   calculating  the  bounding box that each PBM
              pixel will become one
                   dot on the output device, and  applies  your
              dpi
                   specification  to  calculate  the  size  and
              location on the page of
                   the bounding box.

              If you specify NxN, the first number is the
                   horizontal resolution and the second  number
              is the vertical
                   resolution.   If  you  specify just a single
              number N, that is the
                   resolution in both directions.

              The  default  is  72  dots  per  inch   in   both
              directions.

              This  option  was new In Netpbm 10.3 (June 2002).
              Before that,
                   pbmtoepsi always assumed 72 dots per inch in
              both directions.


       -bbonly
              Only  create  a  boundary box, don't fill it with
              the image.
