NAME
       fax2tiff  -  create a TIFF Class F fax file from raw fax
       data

SYNOPSIS
       fax2tiff [ options ] [ -o output.tif ] input.raw

DESCRIPTION
       Fax2tiff creates a TIFF file containing CCITT Group 3 or
       Group  4  encoded data from one or more files containing
       ``raw'' Group 3  or  Group  4  encoded  data  (typically
       obtained  directly  from a fax modem).  By default, each
       row of data in the resultant TIFF file  is  1-dimension-
       ally  encoded and padded or truncated to 1728 pixels, as
       needed.  The resultant image is a set of low  resolution
       (98  lines/inch)  or  medium resolution (196 lines/inch)
       pages, each of which is a single  strip  of  data.   The
       generated file conforms to the TIFF Class F (FAX) speci-
       fication for storing facsimile  data.   This  means,  in
       particular,  that each page of the data does not include
       the trailing return to control (RTC) code;  as  required
       for  transmission  by  the CCITT Group 3 specifications.
       The old, ``classic'', format is created if the -c option
       is used.  (The Class F format can also be requested with
       the -f option.)

       The default name of the output image  is  fax.tif;  this
       can  be  changed with the -o option.  Each input file is
       assumed to be a separate page of facsimile data from the
       same document.  The order in which input files are spec-
       ified on the command line is  the  order  in  which  the
       resultant pages appear in the output file.

OPTIONS
       Options  that  affect  the  interpretation of input data
       are:

       -3     Assume  input  data  is  CCITT  Group  3  encoded
              (default).

       -4     Assume input data is CCITT Group 4 encoded.

       -U     Assume  input  data  is  uncompressed (Group 3 or
              Group 4).

       -1     Assume input data is encoded  with  the  1-dimen-
              sional  version  of  the  CCITT  Group  3 Huffman
              encoding algorithm (default).

       -2     Assume input data is 2-dimensional version of the
              CCITT Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm.

       -P     Assume  input  data is not EOL-aligned (default).
              This option has effect with Group 3 encoded input
              only.

       -A     Assume input data is EOL-aligned. This option has
              effect with Group 3 encoded input only.

       -M     Treat input data as having bits filled from  most
              significant bit (MSB) to most least bit (LSB).

       -L     Treat input data as having bits filled from least
              significant bit (LSB)  to  most  significant  bit
              (MSB) (default).

       -B     Assume input data was encoded with black as 0 and
              white as 1.

       -W     Assume input data was encoded with black as 1 and
              white as 0 (default).

       -R     Specify  the  vertical resolution, in lines/inch,
              of  the  input  images.   By  default  input  are
              assumed  to  have  a  vertical  resolution of 196
              lines/inch.  If images are low resolution facsim-
              ile,  a  value  of 98 lines/inch should be speci-
              fied.

       -X     Specify  the  width,  in  pixels,  of  the  input
              images.   By  default input are assumed to have a
              width of 1728 pixels.

       Options that affect the output file format are:

       -o     Specify the name of the output file.

       -7     Force output to  be  compressed  with  the  CCITT
              Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm (default).

       -8     Force  output  to  be  compressed  with the CCITT
              Group 4 Huffman encoding.

       -u     Force output to be uncompressed (Group 3 or Group
              4).

       -5     Force output to be encoded with the 1-dimensional
              version of the CCITT  Group  3  Huffman  encoding
              algorithm.

       -6     Force output to be encoded with the 2-dimensional
              version of the CCITT  Group  3  Huffman  encoding
              algorithm (default).

       -a     Force the last bit of each End Of Line (EOL) code
              to land on a byte boundary (default). This ``zero
              padding''  will  be  reflected in the contents of
              the Group3Options tag of the resultant TIFF file.
              This  option has effect with Group 3 encoded out-
              put only.

       -p     Do not EOL-align output. This option  has  effect
              with Group 3 encoded output only.

       -c     Generate "classic" Group 3 TIFF format.

       -f     Generate  TIFF Class F (TIFF/F) format (default).

       -m     Force output data to have bits filled  from  most
              significant bit (MSB) to most least bit (LSB).

       -l     Force  output data to have bits filled from least
              significant bit (LSB)  to  most  significant  bit
              (MSB) (default).

       -r     Specify  the  number  of rows (scanlines) in each
              strip of data written to  the  output  file.   By
              default  (or  when  value 0 is specified), tiffcp
              attempts to set the rows/strip that no more  than
              8  kilobytes  of  data  appear  in  a strip (with
              except of  G3/G4  compression  schemes).  If  you
              specify special value -1 it will results in infi-
              nite number of the rows  per  strip.  The  entire
              image will be the one strip in that case. This is
              default  in  case  of  G3/G4  output  compression
              schemes.

       -s     Stretch  the  input  image  vertically by writing
              each input row of data twice to the output  file.

       -v     Force  fax2tiff  to  print  the number of rows of
              data it retrieved from the input file.

       -z     Force output to be compressed with the LZW encod-
              ing.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The following warnings and errors come from the decoding
       routines in the library.

       Warning, %s: Premature EOL at  scanline  %d  (x  %d).\n.
       The  input  data  had  a  row  that was shorter than the
       expected width.  The row is padded with white.

       %s: Premature EOF at scanline %d (x %d).\n.  The decoder
       ran out of data in the middle of a scanline.  The resul-
       tant row is padded with white.

       %s: Bad code word at row %d, x %d\n.  An invalid Group 3
       code was encountered while decoding the input file.  The
       row  number  and  horizontal  position  is  given.   The
       remainder  of the input row is discarded, while the cor-
       responding output row is padded with white.

       %s: Bad 2D code word  at  scanline  %d.\n.   An  invalid
       Group  4 or 2D Group 3 code was encountered while decod-
       ing the input file.  The row number and horizontal posi-
       tion  is  given.  The remainder of the input row is dis-
       carded, while the corresponding  output  row  is  padded
       with white.

BUGS
       Input data are assumed to have a a ``top left'' orienta-
       tion; it should be possible to override this  assumption
       from the command line.
