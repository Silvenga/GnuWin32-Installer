RLEADDCOM(1)                                       RLEADDCOM(1)





NAME
       rleaddcom - add picture comments to an RLE file.

SYNOPSIS
       rleaddcom [ -d ] [ -i ] [ -o outfile ] infile comments

DESCRIPTION
       The  rleaddcom  program will add one or more comments to
       an RLE(5) file.  If infile is "-", it will read from the
       standard  input.  The modified RLE(5) file is written to
       the standard output if the  -o  outfile  option  is  not
       given.   All remaining arguments on the command line are
       taken as comments.  Comments are nominally of  the  form
       name=value  or  name.   Any  comment already in the file
       with the same name will be replaced.

OPTIONS
       -d     Will cause matching comments to  be  deleted,  no
              comments will be added in this case.

       -i     "In  place."   The  input  file will be rewritten
              with the added comments.  This argument  requires
              write  permission  to  the  directory  containing
              infile, but does not require write permission for
              infile.  Of the special file name cases described
              in urt(1), only compressed files may  be  updated
              in  place.   (It doesn't make sense to update the
              output of a pipe "in place", does it?)

              If -o outfile is specified together with -i, then
              outfile  will not be modified until rleaddcom has
              finished (this is similar to the way that into(1)
              works).
