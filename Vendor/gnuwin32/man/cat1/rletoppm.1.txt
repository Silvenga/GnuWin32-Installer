RLETOPPM(1)                                         RLETOPPM(1)





NAME
       rletoppm  -  convert  a  Utah RLE image file into a PBM-
       PLUS/ppm image file.

SYNOPSIS
       rletoppm [ -h ] [ -v ] [ -p ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program converts Utah RLE(5) image files into  PBM-
       PLUS full-color (ppm) image files.  Rletoppm will handle
       four types of RLE files: Grayscale (8 bit data, no color
       map),  Pseudocolor  (8 bit data with a color map), True-
       color (24 bit data with color map), and Directcolor  (24
       bit  data,  no color map).  Since the orgins for the RLE
       and PBMPLUS image file formats are  in  different  loca-
       tions, this program automatically "flips" the image when
       converting.

OPTIONS
       -v     This option will cause  rletoppm  to  operate  in
              verbose  mode.   Header information is printed to
              "stderr".

       -h     This option allows the header of the RLE file  to
              be  dumped  to  "stderr"  without  converting the
              file.  It is equivalent to using  the  -v  option
              except that no file conversion takes place.

       -p     This  option  will  output  the  ppm  data in the
              "plain" format (P3), instead of the default  "raw
              bits"  format  (P6).   The  plain  format is more
              readable, but takes up more space.

       infile The input will be read from this file.  If infile
              is  "-"  or  is  not specified, the input will be
              read from the standard input stream.  The result-
              ing PBMPLUS/ppm data will be sent to "stdout".

EXAMPLES
       rletoppm -v lenna.rle >lenna.ppm
              While  running in verbose mode, convert lenna.rle
              to PBMPLUS/ppm format and store resulting data in
              lenna.ppm.

       rletoppm -h test.rle
              Dump  the  header  information  of  the  RLE file
              called test.rle.

       rletoppm -p test.rle >lenna.ppm
              Convert lenna.rle to PBMPLUS/ppm plain (P3)  for-
              mat and store in lenna.ppm.
