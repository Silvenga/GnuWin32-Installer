APPLYMAP(1)                                         APPLYMAP(1)





NAME
       applymap  -  Apply  the  color map in an RLE file to the
       pixel data

SYNOPSIS
       applymap [ -l ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program takes the color map in an RLE(5)  file  and
       modifies  the  pixel values by applying the color map to
       them.  If there is more than one color  channel  in  the
       input  file, the color map in the input file should have
       the same number of channels.  If the input  file  has  a
       single color channel, the output file will have the same
       number of color channels as the color map.

       Each pixel in the input file is mapped as follows:   For
       a  multi-channel  input  file,  a  pixel in channel i is
       mapped as map[i][pixel] >> 8, producing a pixel in  out-
       put  channel  i.  The right shift takes the 16 bit color
       map value to an 8 bit pixel value.  For a single channel
       input  file,  to  produce a pixel in output channel i is
       produced from the corresponding  input  pixel  value  as
       map[i][pixel] >> 8.

OPTIONS
       -l     This  option will cause a linear (identity) color
              map to be loaded into the  output  file.   Other-
              wise, the output file will have no color map.

       infile The input will be read from this file, otherwise,
              input will be taken from stdin.

       -o outfile
              If specified, output  will  be  written  to  this
              file, otherwise it will go to stdout.

BUGS
       If  the  image  data and color map channels in the input
       file do not conform  to  the  restriction  stated  above
       (N->N or 1->N) the program will most likely core dump.
