NAME
       rletoabA62  - Convert from RLE Format to Abekas A62 Dump
       Format

SYNOPSIS
       rletoabA62 [ -N ] [ -f n ] [ -n n ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       RletoabA62 converts a raster file  in  the  Utah  Raster
       Toolkit RLE format into a format suitable for writing to
       an Abekas A62 dump tape and subsequent loading onto  the
       Abekas disk.  The generated image is 768 pixels wide and
       512 pixels high.  If the input is larger,  it  is  trun-
       cated.   If  it  is smaller, it is padded on the top and
       right with black.  The output is written to stdout,  and
       should  be  written to a tape in 24K byte blocks with dd
       as in the following:

            dd of=/dev/rmt8 obs=24k

       Normally, the output is processed with a simple  digital
       filter;  this  feature may be turned off with an option.
       RletoabA62 normally writes two consecutive frames,  nor-
       mally starting at frame 1.

       Input is taken from stdin unless a file name is given on
       the command line.  Only a single file may be given,  and
       so  if  multiple invocations of rletoabA62 are performed
       in a script, care must be taken to tell the  program  to
       convert  the  data  for  the  proper Abekas frame number
       (1-4).  Otherwise, the colors will  appear  wrong;  they
       will be rotated on a vector scope diagram.

EXAMPLE
       The  following example converts all files ending in .rle
       in the current directory and writes them to a tape.  Two
       frames  are  written  per  image and the frame number is
       incremented accordingly.

                 frame=1
                 number=2
                 for file in *.rle
                 do
                      rletoabA62 -f $frame $file
                      frame=`expr \( \( $frame - 1 \) + $number
                 \) % 4 + 1`
                 done |
                 dd of=/dev/rmt8 obs=24k

OPTIONS
       Options are parsed by getopt(3).

       -N     Do not apply digital filtering.

       -f n   Create  the first frame as Abekas frame number n,
              having a value from  one  to  four.   Consecutive
              frames  increment  this  number modulo four.  The
              default is one.

       -n n   Write n frames of output, incrementing the  frame
              number each time.  The default is two.

BUGS
       This  program  does not preserve the aspect ratio of the
       input.
