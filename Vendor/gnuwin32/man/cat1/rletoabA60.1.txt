NAME
       rletoabA60 - convert RLE images to Abekas yuv format

SYNOPSIS
       rletoabA60  [ -c ] [ -{pP} x y ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile
       ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program converts an RLE(5) file to a yuv byte  file
       suitable  for  display  on an Abekas A60.  Typically the
       yuv file is then rcp'd to the Abekas  for  display.   By
       default  rletoabA60  will  attempt  to  place  the image
       according to the placement values in the  image  header.
       If  the  image  is  to large to fit in the Abekas format
       (720x486), the portion of the image  extending  off  the
       edge will be cropped.

OPTIONS
       -c     Center the image on a black background.

       -p x y Position the lower left corner of the image at (x
              y).

       -P x y Increment the position of the image by (x y).

       At most one of -c, -p, or -P can be specified.

       infile The input will be read from this file, otherwise,
              input will be taken from stdin.

       -o outfile
              If  specified,  output  will  be  written to this
              file, otherwise it will go to stdout.
