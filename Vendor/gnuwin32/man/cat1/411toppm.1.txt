NAME
       411toppm - convert Sony Mavica .411 image to PPM

SYNOPSIS
       411toppm [-width width] [-height height] [411file]

       All  options  may  be abbreviated to the shortest unique
       prefix.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

        411toppm reads a .411 file, such as from a  Sony  Mavic
       camera, and converts it to a PPM image as output.

       Output is to Standard Output.

       The  originator  of  this  program and decipherer of the
       .411 format, Steve Allen  <sla@alumni.caltech.edu>,  has
       this  to say about the utility of this program: 'There's
       so little image in a 64x48  thumbnail  (especially  when
       you  have the full size JPG file) that the only point in
       doing this was to answer the implicit challenge posed by
       the  manual  stating  that only the camera can use these
       files.'


OPTIONS
       -width The width (number of columns) of the input image.
              Default is 64.

       -height
              The  height  (number of rows) of the input image.
              Default is 48.
