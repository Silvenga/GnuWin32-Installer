DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmdither  reads  a  PPM  image  as  input,  and applies
       dithering to it to reduce the number of colors used down
       to the specified number of shades for each primary.  The
       default number of shades is red=5, green=9, blue=5,  for
       a total of 225 colors.  To convert the image to a binary
       rgb format suitable  for  color  printers,  use  -red  2
       -green 2 -blue 2.


OPTIONS
       -dim power
               The size of the dithering matrix.  The dithering
              matrix is a square whose dimension is a power  of
              2.   power is that power of 2.  The default is 4,
              for a 16 by 16 matrix.


       -red shades
              The number of red shades to  be  used,  including
              black; minimum of 2.


       -green shades
              The  number of green shades to be used, including
              black; minimum of 2.


       -blue shades
              The number of blue shades to be  used,  including
              black; minimum of 2.
