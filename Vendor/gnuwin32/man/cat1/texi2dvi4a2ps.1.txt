NAME
       texi2dvi4a2ps  -  Compile Texinfo and LaTeX files to DVI
       or PDF

SYNOPSIS
       texi2dvi4a2ps [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Run each Texinfo or LaTeX FILE through TeX in turn until
       all cross-references are resolved, building all indices.
       The directory  containing  each  FILE  is  searched  for
       included files.  The suffix of FILE is used to determine
       its language (LaTeX or Texinfo).

       Makeinfo is used  to  perform  Texinfo  macro  expansion
       before running TeX when needed.

   Operation modes:
       -b, --batch
              no interaction

       -c, --clean
              remove all auxiliary files

       -D, --debug
              turn on shell debugging (set -x)

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit successfully

       -o, --output=OFILE
              leave output in OFILE (implies --clean); Only one
              input FILE may be specified in this case

       -q, --quiet
              no output unless errors (implies --batch)

       -s, --silent
              same as --quiet

       -v, --version
              display version information and exit successfully

       -V, --verbose
              report on what is done

   TeX tuning:
       -@     use  @input instead of \input; for preloaded Tex-
              info

       -e, --expand
              force macro expansion using makeinfo

       -I DIR search DIR for Texinfo files

       -l, --language=LANG
              specify the LANG of FILE (LaTeX or Texinfo)

       -p, --pdf
              use pdftex or pdflatex for processing

       -t, --texinfo=CMD
              insert CMD after @setfilename in  copy  of  input
              file multiple values accumulate

       The   values   of   the  BIBTEX,  LATEX  (or  PDFLATEX),
       MAKEINDEX, MAKEINFO, TEX (or PDFTEX), and TEXINDEX envi-
       ronment  variables  are  used  to run those commands, if
       they are set.

SEE ALSO
       texi2dvi4a2ps is exactly the same  script  as  texi2dvi,
       part  of  the  package  GNU Texinfo.  It is used by a2ps
       when delegating LaTeX and  Texinfo  files.   Instead  of
       checking  whether  the  version  of  texi2dvi  which  is
       installed is recent enough, it is  more  convenient  for
       the  users  that  a2ps  is  shipped  with the version of
       texi2dvi  it  requires.   a2ps(1),  card(1),   fixps(1),
       pdiff(1), psset(1), texi2dvi4a2ps(1).

       The  full  documentation for texi2dvi is maintained as a
       Texinfo manual.  If the info and texi2dvi  programs  are
       properly installed at your site, the command

              info texi2dvi

       should give you access to the complete manual.
