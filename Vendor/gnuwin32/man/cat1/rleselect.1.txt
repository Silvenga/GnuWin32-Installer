NAME
       rleselect - Select images from an RLE file.

SYNOPSIS
       rleselect  [  -i infile ] [ -o outfile ] [ -v ] [ image-
       numbers ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program selects images from an RLE(5) file contain-
       ing  multiple  concatenated images.  The selected images
       are specified by number; the first image in the file  is
       number  1.   A negative number in the image-numbers list
       means that all images from the previous  number  in  the
       list  to  the  absolute  value  of this number should be
       included.  A zero in the list is taken  as  '-infinity',
       so  that all images from the previous number to the last
       image in the file will be included.  To try  to  clarify
       this, some examples are included below.

OPTIONS
       -i infile
              The input will be read from this file.  If infile
              is "-" or is not specified,  the  input  will  be
              read from the standard input stream.

       -o outfile
              If  specified, the output will be written to this
              file.  If outfile is "-", or if it is not  speci-
              fied,  the output will be written to the standard
              output stream.

       -v     Verbose output.

EXAMPLES
       rleselect 1 4 5
              Selects image 1, 4, and 5.

       rleselect 4 1 5
              Also selects image 1, 4, and 5.

       rleselect 1 -4 5
              Selects images 1 through 4 and 5 (i.e., 1 through
              5).

       rleselect 3 0
              Selects images 3 through the last.

       rleselect -4
              Selects images 1 through 4.
