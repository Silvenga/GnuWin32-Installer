NAME
       pnmmontage - create a montage of PNM images


SYNOPSIS
       pnmmontage

       [-header=headerfile]

       [-quality=n]

       [-prefix=prefix]

       [-0|-1|-2|...|-9]

       pnmfile...


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmmontage  packs images of differing sizes into a mini-
       mum-area  composite  image,  optionally  producing  a  C
       header  file  with the locations of the subimages within
       the composite image.


OPTIONS
       -header
              Tells pnmmontage to write a C header file of  the
              locations  of  the  original  images  within  the
              packed image.  Each original image generates four
              #defines  within  the  packed  file:  xxxX, xxxY,
              xxxSZX, and xxxSZY, where xxx is the name of  the
              file, converted to all uppercase.  The ouput also
              includes #defines OVERALLX  and  OVERALLY,  which
              specifies the total size of the montage image.


       -prefix
              Tells  pnmmontage  to use the specified prefix on
              all of the #defines it generates.


       -quality
              Before attempting to place the subimages, pnmmon-
              tage  will  calculate a minimum possible area for
              the montage; this is  either  the  total  of  the
              areas  of  all the subimages, or the width of the
              widest subimage times the height of  the  tallest
              subimage,  whichever is greater.  pnmmontage then
              initiates a problem-space search to find the best
              packing;  if  it  finds  a  solution  that is (at
              least) as good as  the  minimum  area  times  the
              quality  as  a  percent, it will break out of the
              search.  Thus, -q 100 will find the best possible
              solution;  however,  it may take a very long time
              to do so.  The default is -q 200.


       -0, -1, ... -9
              These options control the  quality  at  a  higher
              level than -q; -0 is the worst quality (literally
              pick the first solution found), while -9  is  the
              best  quality  (perform  an  exhaustive search of
              problem space for  the  absolute  best  packing).
              The  higher  the  number, the slower the computa-
              tion.  The default is -5.



NOTES
       Using -9 is excessively slow on  all  but  the  smallest
       image sets.  If the anymaps differ in maxvals, then pnm-
       montage will pick the smallest maxval  which  is  evenly
       divisible by each of the maxvals of the original images.
