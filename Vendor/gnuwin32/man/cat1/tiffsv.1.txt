NAME
       tiffsv  -  save  an image from the framebuffer in a TIFF
       file (Silicon Graphics version)

SYNOPSIS
       tiffsv [ options ] output.tif [ x1 x2 y1 y2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       tiffsv saves all or part of the framebuffer  in  a  file
       using  the  Tag  Image  File  Format,  Revision 6.0.  By
       default, the image is saved  with  data  samples  packed
       (PlanarConfiguration=1),  compressed with the Lempel-Ziv
       & Welch algorithm (Compression=5), and with  each  strip
       no  more than 8 kilobytes.  These characteristics can be
       overridden, or explicitly  specified  with  the  options
       described below.

OPTIONS
       -b     Save the image as a greyscale image as if it were
              processed by tiff2bw(1).  This option is included
              for  compatibility  with the standard scrsave(6D)
              program.

       -c     Specify the compression to use for  data  written
              to  the  output  file:  none  for no compression,
              packbits for PackBits compression, jpeg for base-
              line  JPEG  compression, zip for Deflate compres-
              sion, and lzw for Lempel-Ziv & Welch  compression
              (default).

              LZW  compression can be specified together with a
              predictor value.  A predictor value of  2  causes
              each scanline of the output image to undergo hor-
              izontal differencing  before  it  is  encoded;  a
              value  of  1  forces  each scanline to be encoded
              without differencing.  LZW-specific  options  are
              specified  by appending a ``:''-separated list to
              the ``lzw'' option; e.g.  -c lzw:2 for  LZW  com-
              pression with horizontal differencing.

       -p     Specify  the planar configuration to use in writ-
              ing image data.  By default, tiffsv will create a
              new  file  with  the data samples packed contigu-
              ously.  Specifying -p contig will force  data  to
              be   written   with   multi-sample   data  packed
              together, while -p separate will force samples to
              be written in separate planes.

       -r     Specify  the  number  of rows (scanlines) in each
              strip of data written to  the  output  file.   By
              default,  tiffsv  attempts  to set the rows/strip
              that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a
              strip.

NOTE
       Except  for  the use of TIFF, this program is equivalent
       to the standard scrsave program.  This means, for  exam-
       ple,  that  you can use it in conjunction with the stan-
       dard icut program simply by creating a link called  scr-
       save,  or by creating a shell script called scrsave that
       invokes tiffgt with the appropriate options.

BUGS
       If data are saved compressed  and  in  separate  planes,
       then  the  rows  in each strip is silently set to one to
       avoid limitations in the libtiff(3TIFF) library.
