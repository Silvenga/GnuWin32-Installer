GROFF(1)                                               GROFF(1)



NAME
       groff - front-end for the groff document formatting sys-
       tem

SYNOPSIS
       [file ...]  -h | --help -v | --version [option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes  the  groff  program,  the  main
       front-end for the groff document formatting system.  The
       groff program and macro suite is the implementation of a
       roff(7)  system  within the free software collection GNU
       The groff system has all features of the classical roff,
       but adds many extensions.

       The groff program allows to control the whole groff sys-
       tem by command line options.  This is a great  simplifi-
       cation  in  comparison to the classical case (which uses
       pipes only).

OPTIONS
       The command line is parsed according to  the  usual  GNU
       convention.   The  whitespace  between  a  command  line
       option and its argument is  optional.   Options  can  be
       grouped  behind a single `-' (minus character).  A file-
       name of - (minus character) denotes the standard  input.

       As  groff  is  a wrapper program for troff both programs
       share a set of options.  But the groff program has  some
       additional,  native  options  and gives a new meaning to
       some troff options.  On the other hand,  not  all  troff
       options can be fed into groff.

   Native groff Options
       The  following  options either do not exist for troff or
       are differently interpreted by groff.

       -D arg Set default input encoding  used  by  preconv  to
              arg.  Implies -k.

       -e     Preprocess with eqn.

       -g     Preprocess with grn.

       -G     Preprocess with grap.

       -h     --help Print a help message.

       -I dir This option may be used to specify a directory to
              search for files (both those on the command  line
              and  those  named  in .psbb and .so requests, and
              \X'ps: import' and \X'ps:  file'  escapes).   The
              current directory is always searched first.  This
              option may  be  specified  more  than  once;  the
              directories  are searched in the order specified.
              No directory search is performed for files speci-
              fied using an absolute path.  This option implies
              the -s option.

       -k     Preprocess with preconv.  This is run before  any
              other  preprocessor.   Please  refer to preconv's
              manual page for its behaviour if no  -K  (or  -D)
              option is specified.

       -K arg Set  input  encoding  used  by  preconv  to  arg.
              Implies -k.

       -l     Send the output to a spooler program  for  print-
              ing.  The command that should be used for this is
              specified by the  print  command  in  the  device
              description  file,  see  groff_font(5).   If this
              command is not present, the output is piped  into
              the  lpr(1)  program  by default.  See options -L
              and -X.

       -L arg Pass arg to the spooler program.   Several  argu-
              ments  should be passed with a separate -L option
              each.  Note that groff does not  prepend  `-'  (a
              minus  sign)  to  arg  before  passing  it to the
              spooler program.

       -N     Don't allow newlines within eqn delimiters.  This
              is the same as the -N option in eqn.

       -p     Preprocess with pic.

       -P -option
              -P -option -P arg  Pass -option or -option arg to
              the postprocessor.  The option must be  specified
              with the necessary preceding minus sign(s) `-' or
              `--' because groff does not  prepend  any  dashes
              before  passing  it  to  the  postprocessor.  For
              example, to pass a title to the  gxditview  post-
              processor, the shell command

                     groff -X -P -title -P 'groff it' foo

              is equivalent to

                     groff  -X -Z foo | gxditview -title 'groff
                     it' -

       -R     Preprocess with refer.  No mechanism is  provided
              for passing arguments to refer because most refer
              options have equivalent  language  elements  that
              can   be  specified  within  the  document.   See
              refer(1) for more details.

       -s     Preprocess with soelim.

       -S     Safer mode.  Pass the -S option to pic  and  dis-
              able the following troff requests: .open, .opena,
              .pso, .sy, and .pi.  For security reasons,  safer
              mode is enabled by default.

       -t     Preprocess with tbl.

       -T dev Set output device to dev.  For this device, troff
              generates   the    intermediate    output;    see
              groff_out(5).   Then  groff calls a postprocessor
              to convert troff's  intermediate  output  to  its
              final format.  Real devices in groff are

                     dvi    TeX  DVI  format  (postprocessor is
                            grodvi).

                     html   xhtml HTML and XHTML  output  (pre-
                            processors     are    soelim    and
                            pre-grohtml,    postprocessor    is
                            post-grohtml).

                     lbp    Canon  CAPSL  printers  (LBP-4  and
                            LBP-8 series laser printers;  post-
                            processor is grolbp).

                     lj4    HP  LaserJet4  compatible (or other
                            PCL5 compatible) printers (postpro-
                            cessor is grolj4).

                     ps     PostScript output (postprocessor is
                            grops).

              For the following TTY output devices (postproces-
              sor  is  always  grotty),  -T  selects the output
              encoding:

                     ascii  7bit ASCII.

                     cp1047 Latin-1 character  set  for  EBCDIC
                            hosts.

                     latin1 ISO 8859-1.

                     utf8   Unicode   character  set  in  UTF-8
                            encoding.

              The following arguments select gxditview  as  the
              `postprocessor' (it is rather a viewing program):

                     X75    75dpi  resolution,  10pt   document
                            base font.

                     X75-12 75dpi   resolution,  12pt  document
                            base font.

                     X100   100dpi  resolution,  10pt  document
                            base font.

                     X100-12
                            100dpi  resolution,  12pt  document
                            base font.

              The default device is ps.

       -U     Unsafe mode.  Reverts to the (old) unsafe  behav-
              iour; see option -S.

       -v     --version Output version information of groff and
              of all programs that are run by it; that is,  the
              given  command  line  is parsed in the usual way,
              passing -v to all subprograms.

       -V     Output the pipeline that would be  run  by  groff
              (as  a  wrapper  program) on the standard output,
              but do not execute it.  If given more than  once,
              the  commands  are  both  printed on the standard
              error and run.

       -X     Use gxditview instead of using the usual postpro-
              cessor  to  (pre)view  a  document.  The printing
              spooler behavior as outlined with options -l  and
              -L is carried over to gxditview(1) by determining
              an  argument  for  the  -printCommand  option  of
              gxditview(1).  This sets the default Print action
              and the corresponding menu entry to  that  value.
              -X  only  produces good results with -Tps, -TX75,
              -TX75-12, -TX100,  and  -TX100-12.   The  default
              resolution  for  previewing -Tps output is 75dpi;
              this can be changed by  passing  the  -resolution
              option to gxditview, for example

                     groff -X -P-resolution -P100 -man foo.1

       -z     Suppress  output  generated by troff.  Only error
              messages are printed.

       -Z     Do not automatically postprocess groff intermedi-
              ate  output in the usual manner.  This will cause
              the troff output to appear  on  standard  output,
              replacing  the  usual  postprocessor  output; see
              groff_out(5).

   Transparent Options
       The following options are transparently handed  over  to
       the formatter program troff that is called by groff sub-
       sequently.  These options are described in  more  detail
       in troff(1).

       -a     ASCII approximation of output.

       -b     Backtrace on error or warning.

       -c     Disable   color   output.    Please  consult  the
              grotty(1) man page for more details.

       -C     Enable compatibility mode.

       -d cs  -d name=s Define string.

       -E     Disable troff error messages.

       -f fam Set default font family.

       -F dir Set path for font DESC files.

       -i     Process standard input after the specified  input
              files.

       -m name
              Include  macro file name.tmac (or tmac.name); see
              also groff_tmac(5).

       -M dir Path for macro files.

       -n num Number the first page num.

       -o list
              Output only pages in list.

       -r cn  -r name=n Set number register.

       -w name
              Enable warning name.

       -W name
              disable warning name.

USING GROFF
       The groff system implements the infrastructure of  clas-
       sical  roff; see roff(7) for a survey on how a roff sys-
       tem works in general.  Due  to  the  front-end  programs
       available  within  the groff system, using groff is much
       easier than classical roff.  This section gives an over-
       view  of the parts that constitute the groff system.  It
       complements roff(7) with groff-specific features.   This
       section  can be regarded as a guide to the documentation
       around the groff system.

   Paper Size
       The virtual paper size used by troff to format the input
       is  controlled  globally with the requests .po, .pl, and
       .ll.  See groff_tmac(5) for the `papersize' macro  pack-
       age which provides a convenient interface.

       The physical paper size, giving the actual dimensions of
       the paper sheets, is controlled by output  devices  like
       grops  with  the  command  line  options -p and -l.  See
       groff_font(5) and the man pages of  the  output  devices
       for more details.  groff uses the command line option -P
       to pass options to output devices; for example, the fol-
       lowing selects A4 paper in landscape orientation for the
       PS device:

              groff -Tps -P-pa4 -P-l ...

   Front-ends
       The groff program is a wrapper around the troff(1)  pro-
       gram.  It allows to specify the preprocessors by command
       line options and automatically  runs  the  postprocessor
       that  is appropriate for the selected device.  Doing so,
       the sometimes  tedious  piping  mechanism  of  classical
       roff(7) can be avoided.

       The grog(1) program can be used for guessing the correct
       groff command line to format a file.

       The groffer(1) program is an allround-viewer  for  groff
       files and man pages.

   Preprocessors
       The  groff  preprocessors  are  reimplementations of the
       classical preprocessors with moderate  extensions.   The
       standard  preprocessors distributed with the groff pack-
       age are

       eqn(1) for mathematical formulæ,

       grn(1) for including gremlin(1) pictures,

       pic(1) for drawing diagrams,

       chem(1)
              for chemical structure diagrams,

       refer(1)
              for bibliographic references,

       soelim(1)
              for including macro  files  from  standard  loca-
              tions,

       and

       tbl(1) for tables.

       A  new  preprocessor not available in classical troff is
       preconv(1) which converts  various  input  encodings  to
       something  groff can understand.  It is always run first
       before any other preprocessor.

       Besides these, there  are  some  internal  preprocessors
       that  are  automatically  run  with some devices.  These
       aren't visible to the user.

   Macro Packages
       Macro packages can be included by option -m.  The  groff
       system  implements and extends all classical macro pack-
       ages in a compatible way and adds some packages  of  its
       own.   Actually,  the following macro packages come with
       groff:

       man    The   traditional   man    page    format;    see
              groff_man(7).  It can be specified on the command
              line as -man or -m man.

       mandoc The general package for man pages;  it  automati-
              cally  recognizes  whether the documents uses the
              man or the mdoc format and branches to the corre-
              sponding  macro  package.  It can be specified on
              the command line as -mandoc or -m mandoc.

       mdoc   The BSD-style man page format; see groff_mdoc(7).
              It  can be specified on the command line as -mdoc
              or -m mdoc.

       me     The   classical   me   document    format;    see
              groff_me(7).   It can be specified on the command
              line as -me or -m me.

       mm     The   classical   mm   document    format;    see
              groff_mm(7).   It can be specified on the command
              line as -mm or -m mm.

       ms     The   classical   ms   document    format;    see
              groff_ms(7).   It can be specified on the command
              line as -ms or -m ms.

       www    HTML-like macros for inclusion in arbitrary groff
              documents; see groff_www(7).

       Details on the naming of macro files and their placement
       can be found in groff_tmac(5); this man page also  docu-
       ments  some  other,  minor  auxiliary macro packages not
       mentioned here.

   Programming Language
       General concepts common to  all  roff  programming  lan-
       guages are described in roff(7).

       The groff extensions to the classical troff language are
       documented in groff_diff(7).

       The groff language as a whole is described in the (still
       incomplete) groff info file; a short (but complete) ref-
       erence can be found in groff(7).

   Formatters
       The central roff formatter within the  groff  system  is
       troff(1).   It provides the features of both the classi-
       cal troff and nroff, as well as  the  groff  extensions.
       The  command line option -C switches troff into compati-
       bility mode which tries to  emulate  classical  roff  as
       much as possible.

       There  is  a  shell  script  nroff(1)  that emulates the
       behavior of classical nroff.  It tries to  automatically
       select the proper output encoding, according to the cur-
       rent locale.

       The formatter program generates intermediate output; see
       groff_out(7).

   Devices
       In  roff,  the  output  targets  are  called devices.  A
       device can be a piece of hardware, e.g., a printer, or a
       software  file  format.   A  device  is specified by the
       option -T.  The groff devices are as follows.

       ascii  Text output using the ascii(7) character set.

       cp1047 Text output using the EBCDIC code page IBM cp1047
              (e.g., OS/390 Unix).

       dvi    TeX DVI format.

       html   HTML output.

       latin1 Text  output  using  the ISO Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1)
              character set; see iso_8859_1(7).

       lbp    Output for Canon CAPSL printers (LBP-4 and  LBP-8
              series laser printers).

       lj4    HP  LaserJet4-compatible  (or other PCL5-compati-
              ble) printers.

       ps     PostScript output; suitable for printers and pre-
              viewers like gv(1).

       utf8   Text output using the Unicode (ISO 10646) charac-
              ter set with UTF-8 encoding; see unicode(7).

       xhtml  XHTML output.

       X75    75dpi X Window System  output  suitable  for  the
              previewers   xditview(1x)  and  gxditview(1).   A
              variant for a 12pt document base font is  X75-12.

       X100   100dpi  X  Window  System output suitable for the
              previewers  xditview(1x)  and  gxditview(1).    A
              variant for a 12pt document base font is X100-12.

       The postprocessor to be used for a device  is  specified
       by  the  postpro command in the device description file;
       see groff_font(5).  This can be overridden with  the  -X
       option.

       The default device is ps.

   Postprocessors
       groff provides 3 hardware postprocessors:

       grolbp(1)
              for some Canon printers,

       grolj4(1)
              for  printers compatible to the HP LaserJet 4 and
              PCL5,

       grotty(1)
              for text output using various encodings, e.g., on
              text-oriented terminals or line-printers.

       Today,  most  printing or drawing hardware is handled by
       the operating system, by device drivers, or by  software
       interfaces, usually accepting PostScript.  Consequently,
       there isn't an urgent  need  for  more  hardware  device
       postprocessors.

       The  groff  software  devices  for conversion into other
       document file formats are

       grodvi(1)
              for the DVI format,

       grohtml(1)
              for HTML and XHTML formats,

       grops(1)
              for PostScript.

       Combined with the many existing  free  conversion  tools
       this  should  be  sufficient to convert a troff document
       into virtually any existing data format.

       The following utility programs around groff  are  avail-
       able.

ENVIRONMENT
       Normally,  the  path separator in the following environ-
       ment variables is the colon; this may vary depending  on
       the  operating system.  For example, DOS and Windows use
       a semicolon instead.

       GROFF_BIN_PATH
              This search path, followed by $PATH, is used  for
              commands  that  are  executed by groff.  If it is
              not set then the directory where the groff  bina-
              ries were installed is prepended to PATH.

       GROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX
              When there is a need to run different roff imple-
              mentations at the same time  groff  provides  the
              facility  to prepend a prefix to most of its pro-
              grams that could provoke name  clashings  at  run
              time  (default  is  to have none).  Historically,
              this prefix was the character g, but  it  can  be
              anything.   For example, gtroff stood for groff's
              troff, gtbl for the groff  version  of  tbl.   By
              setting GROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX to different values,
              the   different   roff   installations   can   be
              addressed.   More exactly, if it is set to prefix
              xxx then groff as a  wrapper  program  internally
              calls  xxxtroff  instead  of  troff.   This  also
              applies  to  the  preprocessors  eqn,  grn,  pic,
              refer,  tbl, soelim, and to the utilities indxbib
              and lookbib.  This feature does not apply to  any
              programs  different  from  the  ones  above (most
              notably groff itself) since they  are  unique  to
              the groff package.

       GROFF_ENCODING
              The  value of this environment value is passed to
              the preconv preprocessor to select  the  encoding
              of  input  files.   Setting  this  option implies
              groff's command line option -k  (this  is,  groff
              actually always calls preconv).  If set without a
              value, groff calls preconv without arguments.  An
              explicit  -K  command  line  option overrides the
              value  of  GROFF_ENCODING.   See  preconv(1)  for
              details.

       GROFF_FONT_PATH
              A  list of directories in which to search for the
              devname directory  in  addition  to  the  default
              ones.   See  troff(1)  and groff_font(5) for more
              details.

       GROFF_TMAC_PATH
              A list of directories  in  which  to  search  for
              macro  files  in addition to the default directo-
              ries.  See troff(1) and  groff_tmac(5)  for  more
              details.

       GROFF_TMPDIR
              The  directory  in which temporary files are cre-
              ated.  If this is not  set  but  the  environment
              variable TMPDIR instead, temporary files are cre-
              ated in the directory  $TMPDIR.   On  MS-DOS  and
              Windows  32  platforms, the environment variables
              TMP and TEMP (in that order) are  searched  also,
              after GROFF_TMPDIR and TMPDIR.  Otherwise, tempo-
              rary files are created in  /tmp.   The  refer(1),
              groffer(1), grohtml(1), and grops(1) commands use
              temporary files.

       GROFF_TYPESETTER
              Preset the default device.  If this  is  not  set
              the  ps  device  is used as default.  This device
              name is overwritten by the option -T.

FILES
       There are some directories in which groff  installs  all
       of its data files.  Due to different installation habits
       on different operating systems, their locations are  not
       absolutely  fixed, but their function is clearly defined
       and coincides on all systems.

   groff Macro Directory
       This contains all information related to macro packages.
       Note  that  more than a single directory is searched for
       those files as documented  in  groff_tmac(5).   For  the
       groff installation corresponding to this document, it is
       located at c:/progra~1/groff/share/groff/1.20/tmac.  The
       following  files  contained in the groff macro directory
       have a special meaning:

       troffrc
              Initialization file for troff.   This  is  inter-
              preted by troff before reading the macro sets and
              any input.

       troffrc-end
              Final startup file for troff.  It is parsed after
              all macro sets have been read.

       name.tmac
              tmac.name Macro file for macro package name.

   groff Font Directory
       This contains all information related to output devices.
       Note that more than a single directory is  searched  for
       those  files;  see troff(1).  For the groff installation
       corresponding to this document, it is located at c:/pro-
       gra~1/groff/share/groff/1.20/font.   The following files
       contained in the groff font  directory  have  a  special
       meaning:

       devname/DESC
              Device  description  file  for  device  name, see
              groff_font(5).

       devname/F
              Font file for font F of device name.

EXAMPLES
       The following example illustrates the power of the groff
       program as a wrapper around troff.

       To  process  a roff file using the preprocessors tbl and
       pic and the me macro set,  classical  troff  had  to  be
       called by

              pic foo.me | tbl | troff -me -Tlatin1 | grotty

       Using  groff,  this pipe can be shortened to the equiva-
       lent command

              groff -p -t -me -T latin1 foo.me

       An even easier way to call this is  to  use  grog(1)  to
       guess the preprocessor and macro options and execute the
       generated command (by using backquotes to specify  shell
       command substitution)

              `grog -Tlatin1 foo.me`

       The simplest way is to view the contents in an automated
       way by calling

              groffer foo.me

BUGS
       On EBCDIC hosts  (e.g.,  OS/390  Unix),  output  devices
       ascii  and  latin1  aren't available.  Similarly, output
       for EBCDIC code page cp1047 is not  available  on  ASCII
       based operating systems.
