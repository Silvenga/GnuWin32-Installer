NAME
       pal2rgb  -  convert a palette color TIFF image to a full
       color image

SYNOPSIS
       pal2rgb [ options ] input.tif output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       Pal2rgb converts a palette color TIFF image  to  a  full
       color  image  by  applying  the  colormap of the palette
       image to each sample to generate a full color RGB image.

OPTIONS
       Options  that  affect  the  interpretation of input data
       are:

       -C     This option overrides  the  default  behavior  of
              pal2rgb  in  determining  whether or not colormap
              entries  contain  16-bit  or  8-bit  values.   By
              default  the colormap is inspected and if no col-
              ormap entry greater than 255 is found,  the  col-
              ormap  is assumed to have only 8-bit values; oth-
              erwise 16-bit values (as  required  by  the  TIFF
              specification) are assumed.  The -C option can be
              used to explicitly specify the number of bits for
              colormap  entries:  -C  8 for 8-bit values, -C 16
              for 16-bit values.

       Options that affect the output file format are:

       -p     Explicitly select the planar  configuration  used
              in  organizing  data samples in the output image:
              -p contig for samples packed contiguously, and -p
              separate   for  samples  stored  separately.   By
              default samples are packed.

       -c     Use the specific compression algorithm to encoded
              image  data  in  the output file: -c packbits for
              Macintosh  Packbits,  -c  lzw  for  Lempel-Ziv  &
              Welch,  -c  zip  for Deflate, -c none for no com-
              pression.  If no  compression-related  option  is
              specified, the input file's compression algorithm
              is used.

       -r     Explicitly specify the number  of  rows  in  each
              strip  of  the  output file.  If the -r option is
              not specified, a number  is  selected  such  that
              each  output  strip has approximately 8 kilobytes
              of data in it.

BUGS
       Only 8-bit images are handled.
