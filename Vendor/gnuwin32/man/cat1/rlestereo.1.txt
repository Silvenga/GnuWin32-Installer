NAME
       rlestereo - produce anaglyph from stereo pair

SYNOPSIS
       rlestereo  [  -l leftscale ] [ -r rightscale ] leftimage
       rightimage

DESCRIPTION
       Rlestereo reads the two named RLE files and  produces  a
       single  image suitable for viewing with red-blue or red-
       green glasses.

       The 'left' image is converted to greyscale  and  written
       on  the  red channel.  The 'right' image is converted to
       greyscale and written on the blue or green channel.  The
       intensity  of the two channels may be scaled in order to
       compensate for the relative intensities of the two  base
       colors as viewed through the glasses.

OPTIONS
       -g     The right-eye image is written to the green chan-
              nel rather than the blue.

       -l leftscale
              Scale the intensities of the  left-eye  greyscale
              image  by the given amount.  The default value is
              0.7.

       -r  rightscale
              Scale the intensities of the right-eye  greyscale
              image  by the given amount.  The default value is
              1.0.
