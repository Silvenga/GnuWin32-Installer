NAME
       rlegrid - create grids and checkerboards in rle format

SYNOPSIS
       rlegrid [ -b bg_color ] [ -c ] [ -f fg_color ] [ -o out-
       file ] [ -s xsize ysize ] [ -w width ]


DESCRIPTION
       rlegrid generates simple grid and checkboard patterns.



OPTIONS
       -b bg_color
              Specifies the  background  color  value.   Should
              between 0 and 255.  Default is 0.

       -c     Generate   checkboards.    With  the  -c  option,
              rlegrid will generate a checkboard  with  squares
              of  size width on a side.  Squares will alternate
              between the foreground and background colors.

              Without the -c option, rlegrid  will  generate  a
              grid.  Grid lines will be width apart and will be
              in the foreground color.  The  remainder  of  the
              image will be in the background color.

       -f fg_color
              Specifies  the  background  color  value.  Should
              between 0 and 255.  Default is 255.

       -o outfile
              Specifies where to  place  the  resulting  image.
              The default is to write to stdout.  If outfile is
              "-", the output will be written to  the  standard
              output stream.

       -s xsize yssize
              This is the size of the resulting image.  Default
              is 512x512.

       -w width
              The spacing  between  grid  lines  or  checkboard
              squares.  The default is 16.
