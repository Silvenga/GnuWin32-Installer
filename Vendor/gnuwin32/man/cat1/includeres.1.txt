NAME
       includeres - filter to include resources in a PostScript
       document

SYNOPSIS
       includeres < document.ps > output.ps

DESCRIPTION
       Includeres includes  resources  (fonts,  procsets,  pat-
       terns,  files,  etc)  in place of %%IncludeResource com-
       ments  in  a  PostScript  document.  The  resources  are
       searched  for  in  the  current directory and the system
       default directory under the resource name, and  with  an
       appropriate extension.  The pipeline

               extractres file.ps | includeres >out.ps

       will  move  all resources appearing in a document to the
       document prologue, removing redundant copies. The output
       file can then be put through page re-arrangement filters
       such as psnup or pstops safely.

FILES
       c:/progra~1/PsUtils/share/psutils  -   system   resource
       directory.
