NAME
       pbmtoescp2  -  convert  a  PBM image to a ESC/P2 printer
       file


SYNOPSIS
       pbmtoescp2

       [-compress=compressionmode] [-resolution=dpi]

       [pbmfile]

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest  unique
       prefix.   You may use two hyphens instead of one to des-
       ignate an option.  You may use  either  white  space  or
       equals signs between an option name and its value.

       Input  is read from file pbmfile if specified, otherwise
       from stdin. Output is written to stdout.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmtoescp2 reads a PBM image as input.  It  produces  an
       ESC/P2  raster graphic printer control stream as output.

        This program creates an output  that  is  printable  on
       Epson  printers  that understand the ESC/P2 printer con-
       trol language  (e.g.  the  Stylus  models).   For  older
       Epson  9-pin  dot  matrix  printers, which use the ESC/P
       protocol, see pbmtoepson.


OPTIONS
       -compress=compressionmode
              This determines the compression  mode  that  pbm-
              toescp2  uses  in  its  output.  Valid values for
              compressionmode are 0 and 1.  -compress=0 results
              in  a  printer  control  stream with uncompressed
              raster graphic data.  -compress=1  results  in  a
              printer control stream with RLE compressed raster
              graphic data (RLE  means  Run  Length  Encoding).
              The default is -compress=1.



       -resolution=dpi
              This  determines  the horizontal and the vertical
              print  resolution  set  in  the  printer  control
              stream.  Another way of looking at it is a decla-
              ration of what the resolution of the input  image
              is  (PBM  images don't have inherent resolution).
              Valid values for dpi are 180 and 360.  See hints
              for more information on this.

              The default is -resolution=360.







HINTS
       RLE  compresses  very  well  bitmaps  of  line drawings,
       preferably  horizontal  oriented  contents  like  texts,
       sheets  of  music,  etc.   However, bitmaps derived from
       photographs are not ideal for RLE.   In  extreme  cases,
       when  no byte repetitions occur in the input, the result
       will be even slightly bigger than the input.   To  avoid
       this, use compression mode 0 to switch off RLE.

       Each pixel in the input PBM image becomes one dot in the
       printed output.  Therefore, you must make sure the width
       and  height  of  the input are appropriate for the print
       resolution you choose and the print area you want.  E.g.
       if you print at 180 dpi and want the image to print as 8
       inches by 10, you must supply a PBM that is 1440  pixels
       wide  by  1800  pixels high.  You can adjust the size of
       the  input  with  pamscale,  pamstretch,  pbmreduce,  or
       pnmenlarge.
