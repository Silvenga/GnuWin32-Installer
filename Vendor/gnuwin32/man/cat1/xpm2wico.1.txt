xpm2wico(1)    The XPM to Windows .ico converter    xpm2wico(1)





NAME
       xpm2wico  -  a free program which converts .xpm files to
       Windows .ico files

SYNOPSIS
       xpm2wico [options] infile [outfile]

DESCRIPTION
       xpm2wico is a program that  converts  X  Pixmaps  (.xpm)
       files to Windows .ico files.

       I have written this program primarily to help free soft-
       ware programmers like me to not depend on  evil  propri-
       etary programs to write Windows icons.

       It  can  create  icons  with 256 colors or more from Xpm
       files with any type of colour scheme, both with hex- and
       literal  colour  encodings.   Support for multiple-icons
       file output will probably be added later.

       Note that xpm2wico does not scale images (yet)  and  the
       Windows  standard  ICO  format only allows dimensions of
       16x16, 32x32 or 64x64.

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command  line  syntax,
       with  long  options  starting  with two dashes (`-').  A
       summary of options are included below.

       -r, --rgb-txt
              Specify a different rgb.txt from the  compiled-in
              default.

              Display informations while processing icons.
