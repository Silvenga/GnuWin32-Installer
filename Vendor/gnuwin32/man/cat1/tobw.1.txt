TOBW(1)                                                 TOBW(1)





NAME
       tobw  -  Convert a 24 bit RLE file to eight bits of gray
       scale value.

SYNOPSIS
       tobw [ -t ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tobw converts an image with 24 bit pixel  values  (eight
       bits  each  of  red,  green  and  blue) to eight bits of
       grayscale information.  The NTSC Y  transform  is  used.
       If  the -t flag is given, then the monochrome pixel val-
       ues are replicated on all three output channels  (other-
       wise,  just  one channel of eight bit data is produced).
       If no input file is specified, tobw  reads  from  stdin.
       If  no  output  file is specified with -o, it writes the
       result to stdout.
