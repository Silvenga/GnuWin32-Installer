NAME
       imgtops2 - convert images to PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       imgtops2  [-t]  [-e] [-d] [-h] [-c xcorner,ycorner ] [-s
       xsize,ysize ] [-o outputfile ] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads an image (binary PPM, binary PGM,  JFIF/JPEG)  and
       produces a Level 2 PostScript EPS file as output.

       Level  2  PostScript contains support for more efficient
       encoding of binary data than the traditional hexadecimal
       representation.   It also natively supports of JPEG-com-
       pressed image data.  This  program  takes  advantage  of
       those features to produce PostScript files that are con-
       siderably smaller than those produced with  older  tools
       (such as pnmtops ).  The resulting files will print only
       on PostScript devices supporting Level 2  features,  but
       Level  2  has  been  around  since 1991 so virtually all
       printers today support it.

       The output of this program with no  options  will  be  a
       one-page  PostScript document with the image centered on
       the page with one-inch margins.  (The default paper size
       will be US letter or A4, depending on options given when
       the package was built.)  The file will contain  a  tight
       bounding  box for the image and other necessary DSC com-
       ments to make the output a legal Encapsulated PostScript
       (EPS) file, suitable for inclusion in other documents.

INPUT IMAGES
       For  PPM  and PGM inputs, only binary (raw format) files
       are supported, and maxval is assumed to be 255.

       If the input is a JFIF file (JPEG File Interchange  For-
       mat,  the  format  commonly known as "a JPEG file"), the
       program  will  directly  encode   the   JPEG   data   as
       PostScript, without further loss of quality.  Both color
       and grayscale JFIFs are supported.  Only  baseline  JPEG
       is  supported,  since  the  PostScript standard does not
       specify support for progressive JPEG.  If you give  img-
       tops2  a  progressive JPEG, it will print a warning mes-
       sage  but  produce  PostScript  output   anyway.    Many
       PostScript devices will choke on this output, but you're
       welcome to try it.

       rdjpgcom -verbose can be used to determine the  encoding
       process  used  for  a  particular  JFIF  file.  jpegtran
       -optimize will  losslessly  transcode  progressive  JPEG
       into  baseline  JPEG.   Both programs are available from
       the Independent JPEG Group (www.ijg.org).

       For all inputs, the output file should be  approximately
       25% larger than the input image file.

OPTIONS
       The  -h  option causes the program to print a summary of
       the command-line options to stderr and exit.

       The -o option causes output to be placed  in  the  given
       file, rather than sent to stdout.

       When  the -t flag is present, the image may be rotated a
       quarter-turn  counterclockwise  on  the  page,  if  that
       allows  the image to be scaled larger.  Whether the out-
       put is turned or not will depend on  the  dimensions  of
       the  input  image  and the size of the printable area on
       the page.  Without the -t option, the image will  always
       appear upright.

       Because  EPS bounding boxes must be specified with inte-
       gral coordinates, it might not be possible to produce  a
       bounding  box  which exactly surrounds the image once it
       is scaled to fit the page.  The  bounding  box  produced
       will  be  conservative:   the program will round so that
       the bounding box includes all of the  image,  but  might
       include  slightly  more of the page.  While the width of
       this extra border will never exceed 1/72", the -e option
       is  provided  for  the  serious purist.  This causes the
       program to ignore the page size  completely,  and  place
       the  image upright, starting at the lower left corner of
       the page, scaled to one pixel per PostScript unit.  This
       file will not be suitable for printing (few printers can
       print all the way to the edges  of  the  page,  and  the
       image  might  be larger than the physical page), but the
       bounding box will exactly contain the image.  Files pro-
       duced  with this option should only be used as EPS input
       to other programs.

       The printable area on the page can be modified with  the
       -c and -s options.  The first sets the lower left corner
       of the printable area, relative to the lower left corner
       of  the  page.   The second sets the width and height of
       the  printable  area.   All  values  are  specified   in
       PostScript  units  (equal  to  1/72"  of  an inch).  The
       default is either US letter size with one  inch  margins
       (equivalent  to  "-c  72,72 -s 468,648") or A4 size with
       one inch margins (eqivalent to "-c 72,72  -s  451,698"),
       depending  on what option was specified when the package
       was built.  Use -h to see the default.

       The -d option omits the image from the output file,  but
       draws  rectangles  indicating  the printable area (red),
       the image area and orientation (blue), and the  bounding
       box  (green).   This  may  be useful for debugging image
       placement on the page.
