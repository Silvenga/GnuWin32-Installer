NAME
       ppmtoeyuv - convert a PPM image into a Berkeley YUV file


SYNOPSIS
       ppmtoeyuv

       [ppmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmtoeyuv reads a PPM image  as  input  and  produces  a
       Berkeley  Encoder  YUV (not the same as Abekas YUV) file
       on the Standard Output file.

       With no argument,  ppmtoeyuvtakes  input  from  Standard
       Input.   Otherwise, ppmfile is the file specification of
       the input file.

       ppmtoeyuv handles multi-image PPM  input  streams,  out-
       putting consecutive eyuv images.  There must be at least
       one image, though.
