NAME
       pbmtolps - convert PBM image to PostScript


SYNOPSIS
       pbmtolps [-dpi n] [pbmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmtolps  reads  a  PBM image as input and outputs Post-
       Script.  The output Postscript uses lines instead of the
       image  operator to generate a (device dependent) picture
       which will be imaged much faster.

       The Postscript path length is  constrained  to  be  less
       that  1000  points  so that no limits are overrun on the
       Apple Laserwriter and (presumably) no other printers.
