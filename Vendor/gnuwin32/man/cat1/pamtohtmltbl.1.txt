NAME
       pamtohtmltbl  -  convert pnm/pam visual image to an HTML
       table


SYNOPSIS
       pamtohtmltbl [-transparent=color] [-verbose] [file]

       Minimum unique abbreviation  of  option  is  acceptable.
       You  may  use double hyphens instead of single hyphen to
       denote options.  You may use white space in place of the
       equals sign to separate an option name from its value.



DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamtohtmltbl  converts  a  visual image to an HTML table
       with one cell per pixel.  The cell  is  empty,  but  its
       background color is that of the pixel.

       file  is  a PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM file.  If PAM, it must
       be a standard visual image of tuple type RGB, GRAYSCALE,
       or  BLACKANDWHITE,  or  something  equivalent with extra
       higher numbered channels, but pamtohtmltbl doesn't check
       the tuple type; it just assumes.

       Note  that the more normal way to include a visual image
       in an HTML document is with a <IMG> tag.


OPTIONS
       -transparent=color
              This option indicates that pixels of  the  speci-
              fied  color are to be transparent in the HTML ta-
              ble.  The table cell for a pixel  of  this  color
              will have no background color specified.

              Specify  the  color  (color) as described for the
              argument of the ppm_parsecolor() library  routine
              .



       -verbose
              This  option  causes pamtohtmltbl to display mes-
              sages about the conversion process.

       Alexander B. Ivanov (SSH)  wrote  a  program  he  called

       libraries  and  handle  PAM  images  and  follow  Netpbm
       conventions, and named it pamtohtmltbl.
