NAME
       tiffdump - print verbatim information about TIFF files

SYNOPSIS
       tiffdump [ options ] name ...

DESCRIPTION
       tiffdump  displays directory information from files cre-
       ated according to the Tag Image  File  Format,  Revision
       6.0.   The  header of each TIFF file (magic number, ver-
       sion, and first directory offset) is displayed, followed
       by  the tag contents of each directory in the file.  For
       each tag, the name, data type, count,  and  value(s)  is
       displayed.   When  the  symbolic  name for a tag or data
       type is known, the symbolic name is  displayed  followed
       by  it's  numeric  (decimal) value.  Tag values are dis-
       played enclosed in ``<>''  characters  immediately  pre-
       ceded  by the value of the count field.  For example, an
       ImageWidth tag might be displayed as ``ImageWidth  (256)
       SHORT (3) 1<800>''.

       tiffdump  is  particularly  useful for investigating the
       contents of TIFF files that libtiff does not understand.

OPTIONS
       -h     Force  numeric  data to be printed in hexadecimal
              rather than the default decimal.

       -m  items
              Change the number of indirect data items that are
              printed. By default, this will be 24.

       -o  offset
              Dump  the contents of the IFD at the a particular
              file offset.  The file offset  may  be  specified
              using  the  usual  C-style syntax; i.e. a leading
              ``0x'' for hexadecimal and a  leading  ``0''  for
              octal.
