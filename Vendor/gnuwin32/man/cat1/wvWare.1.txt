NAME
       wvWare - convert msword documents

SYNOPSIS
       wvWare  [-c  charset] [--charset charset] [-p password] [--pass-
       word password] [-x config.xml] [--config  config.xml]  [-d  dir]
       [--dir dir] filename

DESCRIPTION
       wvWare  converts  word documents into other formats such
       as PS,PDF,HTML,LaTeX,DVI,ABW

   OPTIONS
       -c charset, --charset charset
              word 97 documents are stored in one of  two  for-
              mats,  either  in  8  bit windows codepages or in
              16bit unicode. The unicode can be converted  eas-
              ily into utf-8, and the codepages are promoted to
              unicode and converted from there, except for  the
              western  european  codepage  which is always con-
              verted to iso-5589-15 if possible.  This  is  the
              default behaviour. It in possible to convert into
              other formats or to force a conversion to a  par-
              ticular format, it is not recomended as you don't
              get a guarantee that the output will be  correct,
              for  instance  if you convert an english document
              into koi8-r encoding then it will be  wrong,  but
              if you are sure then you can override the default
              output format using  this  option.  The  charsets
              that are available depend on your system. Systems
              using the gnu libc 2 and  above  can  convert  to
              just about anything, systems that at wv configure
              time prove to be inadequate for  charset  conver-
              sion  use  wv's internal conversion formats which
              are a small subset of the  possible  conversions,
              namely utf-8 iso-5589-15 koi8-r tis-620

       -p password, --password password
              Due  to heroic work done by a great team or work-
              ers, the wv library  can  decrypt  password  pro-
              tected  word  97 and older versions of word docu-
              ments given the correct password.

       -d dir, --dir dir
              If dir is used then any created graphics will  be
              placed  in  this  directory.  The  default is the
              directory in which the word document is.

       -x config.xml, --config config.xml
              Use this to give the location of the config file,
              if  not  used  the config file is searched for by
              first checking the current directory, and then by
              looking  in  the install location, by default its
              /usr/local/lib/wv/wvHtml.xml
