NAME
       pampop9 - simulate a multi-lens camera such as the Pop9


SYNOPSIS
       pampop9 pnmfile|- xtiles ytiles xdelta ydelta


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pampop9  tiles  your  starting  image  xtiles  by ytiles
       times.  Each of these tiles is  taken  from  a  slightly
       different offset within the source, as determined by the
       xdelta and ydelta arguments.


       The top line of tiles in the output is  taken  from  the
       top  of  the  source  image,  the second starts with the
       ydelta row of  the  source  image,  the  next  with  the
       2*ydelta row, and so on.  Similarly, the first column of
       tiles in the output is taken from the left of the source
       image,  the next starts with the xdelta column, the next
       with the 2*xdelta column, and so on.



EXAMPLES
       With a 100 x 100 source image,  then  the  output  image
       from  pampop9  3  3  10 10 will appear to be a three-by-
       three grid, each tile being 80 x 80 pixels.  If the ori-
       gin is taken to be the top-left corner, then the top row
       of tiles will take start at  (0,  0)  (10,  0)  (20,  0)
       within  the  source  image, the middle row will start at
       (0, 10) (10, 10) (20, 10), and the bottom row at (0, 20)
       (10, 20) (20, 20).
