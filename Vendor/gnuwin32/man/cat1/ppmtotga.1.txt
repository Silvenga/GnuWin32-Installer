NAME
       ppmtotga - replaced by pamtotga

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmtotga was replaced in Netpbm 10.6 (July 2002) by pam-
       totga(1).

       pamtotga is backward compatible with ppmtotga, but  also
       recognizes PAM input, including that with an alpha chan-
       nel.
