NAME
       pbmtolj - convert a PBM image to HP LaserJet format


SYNOPSIS
       pbmtolj  [-resolution N] [-float] [-noreset] [-packbits]
       [-delta] [-compress] [pbmfile] [-copies N]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmtolj reads a PBM  image  as  input  and  produces  HP
       LaserJet  data  as  output.  You can send this data to a
       LaserJet or DeskJet printer (at least some of them).

       Each pixel in the input PBM image becomes one dot in the
       printed output.  Therefore, you must make sure the width
       and height of the input are appropriate  for  the  print
       resolution you choose and the print area you want.  E.g.
       if you print at 300 dpi and want the image to print as 8
       inches  by 10, you must supply a PBM that is 2400 pixels
       wide by 3000 pixels high.  You can adjust  the  size  of
       the  input  with  pamscale,  pamstretch,  pbmreduce,  or
       pnmenlarge.

       The input may be a multi-image PBM stream.   Each  input
       image becomes a page of output.  But before Netpbm 10.28
       (June 2005), images after the first one are ignored.

       Note that there is no ljtopbm tool.


OPTIONS
       -resolution
              Specifies the resolution of the output device, in
              dpi.   Another way to look at this is as a decla-
              ration of the resolution of the input image  (PBM
              images  don't have inherent resolution).  Typical
              values are 75,  100,  150,  300,  and  600.   The
              default is 75.


       -float Suppresses  positioning  commands.   By  default,
              pbmtolj places the sequence ESC & l 0  E  in  the
              output,  which  means  to force the top margin to
              zero.  With -float, pbmtolj omits that command.


       -noreset
              Prevents pbmtolj from writing the reset sequences
              to the beginning and end of the output file.


       -packbits
              Enables use of TIFF packbits compression.


       -delta Enables use of delta-between-rows compression.


       -compress
              Enables  use  of  both  TIFF packbits, and delta-
              between-rows compression.


       -copies
              Specifies the the number of copies.  The  default
              is  1.   This  option  controls  the  'number  of
              copies' printer control; pbmtolj  generates  only
              one copy of the image.



       You  can  abbreviate  any  option to its shortest unique
       prefix.
