NAME
       texi2dvi - convert Texinfo documents to PDF

SYNOPSIS
       texi2dvi [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Run  each  Texinfo  or  (La)TeX FILE through TeX in turn
       until all cross-references are  resolved,  building  all
       indices.  The directory containing each FILE is searched
       for included files.  The  suffix  of  FILE  is  used  to
       determine its language ((La)TeX or Texinfo).  To process
       (e)plain  TeX  files,  set  the   environment   variable
       LATEX=tex.

       In  order  to  make  texi2dvi  a  drop-in replacement of
       TeX/LaTeX in AUC-TeX, the FILE may also be  composed  of
       the following simple TeX commands.

       `\input{FILE}'
              the actual file to compile

       `\nonstopmode'
              same as --batch

       Makeinfo  is  used  to  perform  Texinfo macro expansion
       before running TeX when needed.

   General options:
       -b, --batch
              no interaction

       -D, --debug
              turn on shell debugging (set -x)

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit successfully

       -o, --output=OFILE
              leave output in OFILE (implies --clean); only one
              input FILE may be specified in this case

       -q, --quiet
              no output unless errors (implies --batch)

       -s, --silent
              same as --quiet

       -v, --version
              display version information and exit successfully

       -V, --verbose
              report on what is done

   TeX tuning:
       -@     use @input instead of \input for  preloaded  Tex-
              info

       --dvi  output a DVI file [default]

       --dvipdf
              output a PDF file via DVI (using dvipdf)

       -e, -E, --expand
              force macro expansion using makeinfo

       -I DIR search DIR for Texinfo files

       -l, --language=LANG
              specify LANG for FILE, either latex or texinfo

       --no-line-error
              do not pass --file-line-error to TeX

       -p, --pdf
              use pdftex or pdflatex for processing

       -r, --recode
              call recode before TeX to translate input

       --recode-from=ENC
              recode from ENC to the @documentencoding

       --src-specials
              pass --src-specials to TeX

       -t, --command=CMD
              insert CMD in copy of input file

       or --texinfo=CMD
              multiple values accumulate

       --translate-file=FILE
              use given charset translation file for TeX

   Build modes:
       --build=MODE
              specify the treatment of auxiliary files [local]

       --tidy same as --build=tidy

       -c, --clean
              same as --build=clean

       --build-dir=DIR
              specify  where the tidy compilation is performed;
              implies --tidy; defaults to TEXI2DVI_BUILD_DIREC-
              TORY [.]

       --mostly-clean
              remove  the  auxiliary  files and directories but
              not the output

       The MODE  specifies  where  the  TeX  compilation  takes
       place,  and,  as  a consequence, how auxiliary files are
       treated.  The build mode can also be set using the envi-
       ronment variable TEXI2DVI_BUILD_MODE.

   Valid MODEs are:
       `local'
              compile in the current directory, leaving all the
              auxiliary files around.  This is the  traditional
              TeX use.

       `tidy' compile  in  a  local  *.t2d directory, where the
              auxiliary  files  are  left.   Output  files  are
              copied back to the original file.

       `clean'
              same  as  `tidy', but remove the auxiliary direc-
              tory  afterwards.   Every  compilation  therefore
              requires the full cycle.

   Using the `tidy' mode brings several advantages:
       -      the  current  directory  is  not  cluttered  with
              plethora of temporary files.

       -      clutter    can    be    even    reduced     using
              --build-dir=dir:  all  the  *.t2d directories are
              stored there.

       -      clutter can  be  reduced  to  zero  using,  e.g.,
              --build-dir=/tmp/$USER.t2d                     or
              --build-dir=$HOME/.t2d.

       -      the output file is updated after every  succesful
              TeX  run, for sake of concurrent visualization of
              the output.  In a `local' build the viewer  stops
              during the whole TeX run.

       -      if  the  compilation fails, the previous state of
              the output file is preserved.

       -      PDF and DVI compilation are kept in separate sub-
              directories  preventing any possibility of auxil-
              iary file incompatibility.

       On the other  hand,  because  `tidy'  compilation  takes
       place  in  another  directory, occasionally TeX won't be
       able to find some  files  (e.g.,  when  using  \graphic-
       spath):  in  that  case use -I to specify the additional
       directories to consider.

       The values of the BIBTEX, LATEX (or  PDFLATEX),  MAKEIN-
       DEX,  MAKEINFO,  TEX (or PDFTEX), TEXINDEX, and THUMBPDF
       environment variables are used to run those commands, if
       they are set.  Any CMD strings are added after @setfile-
       name for Texinfo input, in  the  first  line  for  LaTeX
       input.
