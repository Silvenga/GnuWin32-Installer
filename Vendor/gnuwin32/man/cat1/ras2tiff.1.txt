NAME
       ras2tiff - create a TIFF file from a Sun rasterfile

SYNOPSIS
       ras2tiff [ options ] input.ras output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       ras2tiff converts a file in the Sun rasterfile format to
       TIFF.  By default, the TIFF image is created  with  data
       samples  packed (PlanarConfiguration=1), compressed with
       the Lempel-Ziv & Welch  algorithm  (Compression=5),  and
       with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.  These charac-
       teristics can overridden, or explicitly  specified  with
       the options described below.

       Any  colormap  information  in the rasterfile is carried
       over to the TIFF file by including a Colormap tag in the
       output file.  If the rasterfile has a colormap, the Pho-
       tometricInterpretation tag is set to 3 (palette); other-
       wise  it is set to 2 (RGB) if the depth is 24 or 1 (min-
       is-black) if the depth is not 24.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify a compression scheme to use when  writing
              image  data: -c none for no compression, -c pack-
              bits for the PackBits compression  algorithm,  -c
              jpeg for the baseline JPEG compression algorithm,
              -c zip for the Deflate compression algorithm, and
              -c lzw for Lempel-Ziv & Welch (the default).

       -r     Write  data  with  a specified number of rows per
              strip; by default the  number  of  rows/strip  is
              selected  so  that  each strip is approximately 8
              kilobytes.

BUGS
       Does not handle all possible rasterfiles.   In  particu-
       lar, ras2tiff does not handle run-length encoded images.
