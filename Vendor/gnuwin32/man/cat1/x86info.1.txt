NAME
       x86info -- display x86 CPU diagnostics

SYNOPSIS
       x86info  [-a]  [-c]  [-f] [fB-F]  [-m] [-mhz]  [-r]  [?]
       [--all]   [--cache]   [--flags]   [--verbose]    [--msr]
       [--mhz]  [--registers]  [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents x86info, a program which dis-
       plays a range of information about the CPUs  present  in
       an x86 system.

       In  order  to  make full use of this program you need to
       have the CPU ID and MSR device drivers  in  your  kernel
       with  accessible  device  files  /dev/cpu/<n>/cpuid  and
       /dev/cpu/<n>/msr.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line  syntax,
       with  long  options  starting  with two dashes (`-').  A
       summary of options is included below.

       ?           --help
                 Show summary of options.

       -a           --all
                 Show all information.  Equivalent to -c -f  -m
                      -r -mhz.

       -c           --cache
                 Show TLB, cache sizes and cache associativity.

       -f           --flags
                 Show CPU feature flags.

       -m           --msr
                 Dump model specific registers.   This  feature
                 is currently only supported on a few different
                 processors. Future versions will include pars-
                 ing of bits in MSRs for all processors.

       -mhz           --mhz
                 Estimate current clock rate.

       -mp            --mptable
                 Dump MP table showing CPUs BIOS knows about.

       -r           --registers
                 Show  register  values from all possible cpuid
                 calls.

       -s           --show-bluesmoke
                 Show machine check exception information.

       -v           --verbose
                 Show verbose descriptions.
