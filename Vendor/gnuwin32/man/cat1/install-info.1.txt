NAME
       install-info - update info/dir entries

SYNOPSIS
       install-info [OPTION]... [INFO-FILE [DIR-FILE]]

DESCRIPTION
       Add  or remove entries in INFO-FILE from the Info direc-
       tory DIR-FILE.

OPTIONS
       --debug
              report what is being done.

       --delete
              delete  existing  entries  for   INFO-FILE   from
              DIR-FILE; don't insert any new entries.

       --description=TEXT
              the  description  of the entry is TEXT; used with
              the --name option to become synonymous  with  the
              --entry option.

       --dir-file=NAME
              specify file name of Info directory file; equiva-
              lent to using the DIR-FILE argument.

       --dry-run
              same as --test.

       --entry=TEXT
              insert TEXT as an Info directory entry.  TEXT  is
              written as an Info menu item line followed

              by zero or more extra lines starting with whites-
              pace.

              If you specify  more  than  one  entry,  all  are
              added.   If  you  don't specify any entries, they
              are determined

              from information in the Info file itself.

              When  removing,  TEXT  specifies  the  entry   to
              remove.   TEXT  is only removed as a last resort,
              if the entry as determined from the Info file  is
              not  present,  and  the basename of the Info file
              isn't found either.

       --help display this help and exit.

       --info-dir=DIR
              same as --dir-file=DIR/dir.

       --info-file=FILE
              specify Info file to install  in  the  directory;
              equivalent to using the INFO-FILE argument.

       --item=TEXT
              same as --entry=TEXT.

       --keep-old
              do not replace entries, or remove empty sections.

       --menuentry=TEXT
              same as --name=TEXT.

       --name=TEXT
              the  name  of  the  entry  is  TEXT;  used   with
              --description   to  become  synonymous  with  the
              --entry option.

       --no-indent
              do not format new entries in the DIR file.

       --quiet
              suppress warnings.

       --regex=R
              put this file's  entries  in  all  sections  that
              match the regular expression R (ignoring case).

       --remove
              same as --delete.

       --remove-exactly
              only   remove  if  the  info  file  name  matches
              exactly; suffixes such as .info and .gz  are  not
              ignored.

       --section=SEC
              put  entries in section SEC of the directory.  If
              you  specify  more  than  one  section,  all  the
              entries

              are added in each of the sections.

              If  you  don't  specify  any  sections,  they are
              determined

              from information in the Info file itself.

       --section R SEC
              equivalent to --regex=R --section=SEC --add-once.

       --silent
              suppress warnings.
