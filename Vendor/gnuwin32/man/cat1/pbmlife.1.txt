NAME
       pbmlife  -  apply  Conway's  rules of Life to a portable
       bitmap


SYNOPSIS
       pbmlife [pbmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmlife reads a portable bitmap as  input,  applies  the
       rules  of  Life to it for one generation, and produces a
       PBM image as output.

       A white pixel in the image  is  interpreted  as  a  live
       beastie, and a black pixel as an empty space.
