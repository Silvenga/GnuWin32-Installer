T1ASM(1)                                                              T1ASM(1)



NAME
       t1asm - assemble PostScript Type 1 font

SYNOPSIS
       t1asm [-a|-b] [-l length] [input [output]]

DESCRIPTION
       t1asm  assembles  Adobe Type 1 font programs into either
       PFA (hexadecimal) or PFB (binary) formats from a  human-
       readable  form. If the file output is not specified out-
       put goes to the standard output. If the  file  input  is
       not specified input comes from the standard input.

       t1asm  tokenizes  the charstring data and performs eexec
       and charstring encryption as specified  in  the  ``black
       book,'' Adobe Type 1 Font Format.

       The input must have a line of the form
              /-|{string currentfile exch readstring pop}executeonly def
       which defines the command, in this case `-|', that is to
       start charstring data. It is an error not to define such
       a command. Another common name for this command is `RD'.

       After the start of the Subrs array  in  the  input,  all
       open  braces  `{'  not  in a comment begin a charstring.
       Such a charstring is terminated by the next  non-comment
       close  brace  `}'.  Within  such a charstring, only com-
       ments,  integers,  and  valid  charstring  commands  are
       allowed.  Valid charstring command names can be found in
       Adobe Type 1 Font Format and other documents  describing
       the newer Type 2 opcodes. The format within a charstring
       is unimportant as long as integers and commands are sep-
       arated  by  at  least a one whitespace (space, tab, new-
       line) character. Note that within charstrings,  comments
       are discarded because they cannot be encoded.

OPTIONS
       --pfa, -a
            Output in PFA (ASCII) format.

       --pfb, -b
            Output in PFB (binary) format. This is the default.

       --block-length=num, -l num
            PFB only: Set the maximum output  block  length  to
            num.   The  default  length  is  as large as memory
            allows.

       --line-length=num, -l num
            PFA only: Set the maximum length of encrypted lines
            in  the  output  to num.  (These are the lines con-
            sisting wholly of hexadecimal digits.) The  default
            is 64.

EXAMPLES
       % t1asm Utopia-Regular.raw > Utopia-Regular.pfb
       % t1asm -a Utopia-Regular.raw > Utopia-Regular.pfa

       The Type 2 Charstring Format, also available from  Adobe
       as  a  PDF  file,  describes the newer Type 2 operators,
       which are also used in some multiple-master Type 1 fonts
       like    Adobe    Jenson    and   Kepler.    http://part-
