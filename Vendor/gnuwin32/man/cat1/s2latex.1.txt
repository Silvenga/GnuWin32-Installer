NAME
       s2latex  -  convert  Scribe input files to TeX/Latex input
       files

SYNOPSIS
       s2latex [ -k ] [ -q ] [ -s symfile ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       S2latex reads the files and produces a Latex input file on
       the standard output.  If no files are given, s2latex reads
       standard input.

       -k     outputs  every  unrecognized  Scribe   keyword   to
              stderr.   Default  translation rules are applied to
              unrecognized keywords (i.e., @keyword(...) -> \key-
              word{...}  and  @begin(env)  -> \begin{env}).  This
              option can be used to call your attention  to  key-
              words that should use other translation rules.

       -q     changes the processing of double quotes.  Normally,
              double quotes  are  converted  to  directed  single
              quotes  (i.e.,  "..."  -> `...').  This flag leaves
              the double quotes (they are printed from  the  "tt"
              font).

       -s     gives  the  name of a file containing additional or
              replacement translation rules for  Scribe  keywords
              or  environments.   Each  line  of this file should
              have the format:

                word  rule  replacement

              word is the keyword or environment name (a  keyword
              name is distinguished by a leading "@").  This name
              should be given in lower case .  Rule is  the  name
              of  the translation rule (see below).  It can be in
              either case and only the first character is signif-
              icant.   Replacement  is  replacement  text for the
              keyword.  It must be given even if not required  by
              the rule.

       S2latex  has  9  translation  rules (read "->" as "is con-
       verted to"):

       replace:
              @kw(...) -> \rep{...}
              @begin(env)...@end(env) -> \begin{rep}...\end{rep}
              I.e., the keyword or  environment  name  is  simply
              replaced by a new name.

       delete:
              @kw(...) -> ...
              @begin(env)...@end(env) -> ...
              I.e., the keyword or environment is deleted but the
              enclosed text is left.

       font:  @kw(...) -> {\rep ...}
              @begin(env)...@end(env) -> {\rep ...}
              This is the appropriate translation for a TeX font;
              i.e., @i(xyz) to {\it xyz}.

       environment:
              @kw(...) -> \begin{rep}...\end{rep}
              @begin(env)...@end(env) -> \rep{...}
              I.e.,  a  keyword is converted to an environment or
              an environment to a keyword.

       itemize:
              @kw(...) -> \begin{rep}...\end{rep}
              @begin(env)...@end(env) -> \begin{rep}...\end{rep}
              In addition, the start of each new paragraph in the
              enclosed text will be preceded by a "\item ".

       tag:   (aka,  "description").   Like itemize but the start
              of each new paragraph is preceded by  "\item["  and
              the first tab in the paragraph is replaced by "] ".
              I.e., this is the Latex "description"  environment.

       comment:
              The  keyword  or  environment  and  all of the text
              enclosed are output preceded by "%" (the  TeX  com-
              ment  character).  I.e., this "comments out" a key-
              word or environment.

       alignment:
              @kw(...)         ->         \begin{rep}...\end{rep}
              @begin(env)...@end(env) -> \begin{rep}...\end{rep}
              Each  Scribe  tab  in the enclosed text is replaced
              with " & " (the TeX alignment tab) and each newline
              is preceded by "\\".

       nop:   @kw(...) -> \rep{...}
              Like replace but has the side effect of saying this
              keyword generates no  text.   (This  is  used  when
              s2latex  is trying to identify the "tag" portion of
              a paragraph in a @description environment).

       S2latex starts with the following translation rules.   The
       user  can  augment  or redefine any of these rules via the
       '-s' command line option.

       csam.arpa)  with  thanks  to  Richard Furuta for much help
       decoding Scribe.

BUGS
       The program isn't intended to do a  100%  conversion.   It
       usually  gets about 90% right on the first pass.  With the
       addition of a few translation rules & some judicious edit-
       ting  of  the Scribe input file, it can get you 99% of the
       way to a document that Latex will accept.  This may  still
       be  a long way from a document that you'll accept but such
       are the joys of typesetting.

       The "parse error at line xxx" message isn't all that help-
       ful.   Start  by looking in the input file around the line
       number given.  Errors are usually caused by:

       o a Scribe macro or  environment  definition.   Delete  it
         from the input file & try again.

       o some  interesting  new way to do "descriptions" or "for-
         mats".  If it's a  description,  either  fix  things  so
         s2latex  can  find the tag or put in a dummy tag so that
         the rest of  the  description  environment  doesn't  get
         screwed  up.  If it's a format, either the fixup will be
         obvious or you should change to format keyword to  some-
         thing  unrecognized  &  fix  things  later in the output
         file.

       The following two  character  control  sequences  probably
       should  be  converted to something but aren't: @!, @$, @:,
       @/, @|, @&, @), @# and @].

       In a format environment, all Scribe tab commands (@\,  @=,
       @>, @^) get converted to the TeX alignment tab (&).

       A  lot better job could be done on formats and macro defi-
       nitions.
