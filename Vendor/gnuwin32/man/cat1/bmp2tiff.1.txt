NAME
       bmp2tiff  -  create a TIFF file from a Microsoft Windows
       Device Independent Bitmap image file

SYNOPSIS
       bmp2tiff [ options ] input.bmp  [input2.bmp  ...]   out-
       put.tiff

DESCRIPTION
       bmp2tiff converts a Microsoft Windows Device Independent
       Bitmap image file to TIFF.  If several input  BMP  files
       are  being specified the multipage TIFF output file will
       be created. By default, the TIFF image is  created  with
       data  samples packed (PlanarConfiguration=1), compressed
       with the  PackBits  algorithm  (Compression=32773),  and
       with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.  These charac-
       teristics can overridden, or explicitly  specified  with
       the options described below.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify  a compression scheme to use when writing
              image data: -c none for no compression, -c  pack-
              bits  for the PackBits compression algorithm (the
              default), -c jpeg for the baseline JPEG  compres-
              sion  algorithm,  -c zip for the Deflate compres-
              sion algorithm,  and  -c  lzw  for  Lempel-Ziv  &
              Welch.

       -r <number>
              Write  data  with  a specified number of rows per
              strip; by default the  number  of  rows/strip  is
              selected  so  that  each strip is approximately 8
              kilobytes.
