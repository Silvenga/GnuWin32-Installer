NAME
       thumbnail - create a TIFF file with thumbnail images

SYNOPSIS
       thumbnail [ options ] input.tif output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       thumbnail is a program written to show how one might use
       the SubIFD tag (#330) to store thumbnail images.  thumb-
       nail  copies a TIFF Class F facsimile file to the output
       file and for each image  an  8-bit  greyscale  thumbnail
       sketch.   The  output  file contains the thumbnail image
       with the associated full-resolution  page  linked  below
       with the SubIFD tag.

       By  default, thumbnail images are 216 pixels wide by 274
       pixels high.  Pixels are calculated by sampling and fil-
       tering  the  input  image  with  each pixel value passed
       through a contrast curve.

OPTIONS
       -w     Specify the width of thumbnail images in  pixels.

       -h     Specify the height of thumbnail images in pixels.

       -c     Specify a contrast curve to apply  in  generating
              the  thumbnail  images.  By default pixels values
              are passed through a linear contrast  curve  that
              simply  maps the pixel value ranges.  Alternative
              curves are: exp50 for a  50%  exponential  curve,
              exp60  for  a  60% exponential curve, exp70 for a
              70% exponential curve, exp80 for a  80%  exponen-
              tial  curve,  exp90  for a 90% exponential curve,
              exp for a pure exponential curve,  linear  for  a
              linear curve.

BUGS
       There  are no options to control the format of the saved
       thumbnail images.
