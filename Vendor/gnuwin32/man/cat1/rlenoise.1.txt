NAME
       rlenoise - Add random noise to an image

SYNOPSIS
       rlenoise [ -n amount ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rlenoise  adds  uniform  random  noise to an image.  The
       peak-to-peak amplitude of the  noise  can  be  specified
       with  the -n flag, the default value is 4.  This program
       may be useful for trying to deal with quantization in an
       output  device, if you are able to trade spatial resolu-
       tion for color resolution, and you  don't  have  a  good
       characterization of the quantization function.

OPTIONS
       infile The input will be read from this file, otherwise,
              input will be taken from stdin.

       -o outfile
              If specified, output  will  be  written  to  this
              file, otherwise it will go to stdout.
