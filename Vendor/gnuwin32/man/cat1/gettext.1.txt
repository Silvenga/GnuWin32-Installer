NAME
       gettext - translate message

SYNOPSIS
       gettext [OPTION] [[TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID]
       gettext [OPTION] -s [MSGID]...

DESCRIPTION
       The  gettext  program translates a natural language mes-
       sage into the user's language, by looking up the  trans-
       lation in a message catalog.

       Display  native  language  translation of a textual mes-
       sage.

       -d, --domain=TEXTDOMAIN
              retrieve translated messages from TEXTDOMAIN

       -e     enable expansion of some escape sequences

       -E     (ignored for compatibility)

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -n     suppress trailing newline

       -V, --version
              display version information and exit

       [TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID
              retrieve  translated  message  corresponding   to
              MSGID from TEXTDOMAIN

       If  the TEXTDOMAIN parameter is not given, the domain is
       determined from the environment variable TEXTDOMAIN.  If
       the  message  catalog is not found in the regular direc-
       tory, another location can be specified with  the  envi-
       ronment  variable  TEXTDOMAINDIR.  When used with the -s
       option the program behaves like the `echo' command.  But
       it  does  not  simply  copy  its  arguments  to  stdout.
       Instead those messages found in the selected catalog are
       translated.  Standard search directory: c:/progra~1/Get-
       text/share/locale
