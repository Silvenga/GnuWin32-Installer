RLEBOX(1)                                             RLEBOX(1)





NAME
       rlebox - print bounding box for image in an RLE file.

SYNOPSIS
       rlebox [ -c ] [ -m margin ] [ -v ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program prints the bounding box for the image por-
       tion of an RLE(5)  file.   This  is  distinct  from  the
       bounds  in  the file header, since it is computed solely
       on the basis of the actual image.  All background pixels
       are ignored.

OPTIONS
       -c     Print  the  numbers  in the order that crop wants
              them on its command line.  The default  order  is
              xmin  xmax  ymin  ymax.  If this option is speci-
              fied, the bounds are printed in  the  order  xmin
              ymin  xmax  ymax.   Thus, a file foo.rle could be
              trimmed to the smallest  possible  image  by  the
              command
                        crop `rlebox -c foo.rle` foo.rle

       -m margin
              Pads the output values by the margin given.

       -v     Verbose  mode:  label  the numbers for human con-
              sumption.

       infile Name  of  the  RLE  file  (defaults  to  standard
              input).
