       EXECUTABLE  should  accept  `--help'   and   `--version'
       options although alternatives may be specified using:

       -h, --help-option=STRING
              help option string

       -v, --version-option=STRING
              version option string

INCLUDE FILES
       Additional  material  may  be  included in the generated
       output with the  --include  and  --opt-include  options.
       The format is simple:

           [section]
           text

           /pattern/
           text

       Blocks of verbatim *roff text are inserted into the out-
       put either at the start of  the  given  [section]  (case
       insensitive), or after a paragraph matching /pattern/.

       Patterns  use the Perl regular expression syntax and may
       be followed by the i, s or m modifiers (see  perlre(1)).

       Lines  before  the  first section or pattern which begin
       with `-' are processed as  options.   Anything  else  is
       silently  ignored and may be used for comments, RCS key-
       words and the like.

       The section output order is:

           NAME
           SYNOPSIS
           DESCRIPTION
           OPTIONS
           EXAMPLES
           other

       Any [name]  or  [synopsis]  sections  appearing  in  the
       include  file will replace what would have automatically
       been produced (although you can still override the  for-
       mer with --name if required).

       Other  sections  are prepended to the automatically pro-
       duced output for the standard sections given  above,  or
       included at other (above) in the order they were encoun-
       tered in the include file.
