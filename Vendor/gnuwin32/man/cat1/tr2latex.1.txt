NAME
       tr2latex - convert a document from troff to LaTeX

SYNOPSIS
       tr2latex  [ -m ] [ -t ] [ -n ] [ -s style ] [ -o outfile
       ] filename...

DESCRIPTION
       Tr2latex converts a document typeset in troff to a LaTeX
       format.  It is intended to do the first pass of the con-
       version. The user should then finish up the rest of  the
       conversion  and  customize  the  converted manuscript to
       his/her liking.  It can also serve as a tutor for  those
       who want to convert from troff to LaTeX.

       Most of the converted document will be in LaTeX but some
       of it may be in plain TeX.  It will also use some macros
       in troffms.sty or troffman.sty which are included in the
       package and must be available to the document when  pro-
       cessed with LaTeX.

       If  there  is more than one input file, they will all be
       converted into one LaTeX document.

       Tr2latex understands most of the -ms and -man macros and
       eqn  preprocessor  symbols.  It also understands several
       plain troff commands. Few tbl preprocessor commands  are
       understood to help convert very simple tables.

       When  converting  manuals,  use  the  -m flag. Otherwise
       tr2latex assumes to translate a -me input file.

       If a troff command cannot be converted,  the  line  that
       contain that command will be commented out.

       NOTE: if you have eqn symbols, you must have the in-line
       mathematics delimiter defined by delim in the  file  you
       are  converting. If it is defined in another setup file,
       that setup file has to be concatenated with the file  to
       be converted, otherwise tr2latex will regard the in-line
       math as ordinary text.

OPTIONS
       -m          Convert manual pages.  This  makes  tr2latex
                   understand  most of the -man macros. It uses
                   the style file troffman.sty.

       -t          Produce twoside page style.

       -n          Use a font size of npt.   The  default  font
                   size is 12pt for -man and 11pt otherwise.

       -s style    Use  the  style  file  style  instead of the
                   default article.sty.

       -o outfile  Write output to file outfile.

BUGS
       Many of these bugs are  harmless.  Most  of  them  cause
       local  errors  that  can be fixed in the converted manu-
       script.

       - Some macros and macro arguments are not recognized.

       - Commands that are not separated from their argument by
       a space are not properly parsed (e.g .sp3i).

       -  When  some  operators (notably over, sub and sup) are
       renamed (via define), then they are encountered  in  the
       text,  tr2latex  will  treat them as ordinary macros and
       will not apply their rules.

       - rpile, lpile and cpile are treated the same as  cpile.

       - rcol, lcol are treated the same as ccol.

       - Math-mode size, gsize, fat, and gfont are ignored.

       -  lineup and mark are ignored. The rules are so differ-
       ent.

       - Some troff commands are translated  to  commands  that
       require delimiters that have to be explicitly put. Since
       they are sometimes not put in  troff,  they  can  create
       problems.  Example: .nf not closed by .fi.

       -  When local motions are converted to \raise or \lower,
       an \hbox is needed, which has to be put  manually  after
       the conversion.

       -  'a  sub  i  sub  j' is converted to 'a_i_j' which TeX
       parses as 'a_i{}_j}' with a complaint that it is  vague.
       'a  sub  {i sub j}' is parsed correctly and converted to
       'a_{i_j}'.

       - Line spacing is not changed within a paragraph in  TeX
       (which  is  a  bad  practice anyway).  TeX uses the last
       line spacing in effect in that paragraph.

TODO
       Access registers via .nr command.
