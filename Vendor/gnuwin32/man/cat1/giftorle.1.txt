NAME
       giftorle - Convert GIF images to RLE format

SYNOPSIS
       giftorle [ -c ] [ -o outfile.rle ] [ infile.gif ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Giftorle  converts a file from Graphics Interchange For-
       mat (GIF) format into RLE format.  Multiple input images
       may  be converted, these will be written sequentially to
       the output RLE file.  The origin of a GIF  image  is  at
       the  upper  left, while the origin of an RLE image is at
       the lower left.  This program  automatically  flips  the
       image to preserve its orientation.

OPTIONS
       -c     Preserve  the  colormap  that  the GIF image con-
              tains, otherwise the colormap is applied to input
              image.

       -o outfile.rle
              If  specified, the output will be written to this
              file.  If outfile.rle is "-", or  if  it  is  not
              specified,  the  output  will  be  written to the
              standard output stream.

       infile.gif ...
              The input will be  read  from  these  files.   If
              infile.gif  is "-" or is not specified, the input
              will be read from the standard input stream.
