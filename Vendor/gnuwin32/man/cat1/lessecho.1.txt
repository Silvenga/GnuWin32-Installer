       lessecho is a program that simply echos its arguments on
       standard  output.  But any argument containing spaces is
       enclosed in quotes.

       -ox    Specifies "x" to be the open quote character.

       -cx    Specifies "x" to be the close quote character.

       -pn    Specifies "n" to be the open quote character,  as
              an integer.

       -dn    Specifies "n" to be the close quote character, as
              an integer.

       -mx    Specifies "x" to be a metachar.

       -nn    Specifies "n" to be a metachar, as an integer.

       -ex    Specifies  "x"  to  be  the   escape   char   for
              metachars.

       -fn    Specifies   "n"   to   be  the  escape  char  for
              metachars, as an integer.
