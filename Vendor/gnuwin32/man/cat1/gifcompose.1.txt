GIFCOMPOSE(1)                                                    GIFCOMPOSE(1)



NAME
       gifcompose - a GIF compositor

SYNOPSIS
       gifcompose [-v] <specfile

DESCRIPTION
       The gifcompose tool takes a series of text lines and
       interprets them as commands to do pasteup operations.
       Text directives may be generators, modifiers, target
       operations and comments.

       Generators


       gif<name>
           Paste in <name>.gif

       raw <name> <width> <height>
           Paste in the given raw-format file (no suffix sup-
           plied). Raw format is a stream of 8-bit indices into
           the EGA color map. Accordingly, the width and height
           must be specified, and the source must be exactly
           width times height bytes long.

       rgb <name> <width> <height>
           Paste in the given RGB-format file (no suffix sup-
           plied). Raw format is a stream of 24-bit color val-
           ues.  Accordingly, the width and height must be
           specified, and the source must be exactly 3 times
           width times height bytes long.

       rle <name>
           Paste in the given RLE-format file (no suffix sup-
           plied). This converts the Utah Raster Kit format to
           GIF.

       text <text> [foreground <index>] [color <r> <g> <b>]
           Copy 8x8 monospace font, with transparent background
           and index 1 as foreground. If the text string con-
           tains whitespaces, they must be escaped or the
           string must be quoted (shell conventions).

           The optional suffix `foreground <n>' sets the fore-
           ground color index. The optional suffix `color <r>
           <g> <b>' sets the RGB color to be used for the fore-
           ground index.

       Each generator operation may be followed by any combina-
       tion of the following modifiers.

       Modifiers


       at <x> <y>
           Place the image at the given (upper-left-hand-cor-
           ner) coordinates in the pasted-up result.

       clip <name> <top-x> <top-y> <bottom-x> <bottom-y>
           Clip image using the given rectange, paste it onto.

       xflip
           Flip the image around the X axis before placing it.

       yflip
           Flip the image around the Y axis before placing it.

       left
           Rotate the image 90 degrees counterclockwise before
           placing it.

       right
           Rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise before placing
           it.

       Target Operations


       screen size <x-size> <y-size>
          Set the global screen size of the final image.

       screen position <x> <y>
          Set the global screen position of the final image.

       Comments

       Comments or comment lines may be preceded with `#' and
       will be ignored.

OPTIONS
       -v  Emit a report on each composition action to stderr
           as it happens.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Unknown screen operation
           Valid screen operations are: size & position.

       Unknown operator
           Allowed operators are: at, clip, xflip, yflip, left
           & right.

FILES
       comp$$
           Work Directory.

       tmp$$, btmp$$
           Work Files.

CAVEATS
       Memory required is proportional to the size of the
       largest pasted image.

BUGS
       The suffix sequence `left left' sometimes mysteriously
       fails to work, probably due to some restriction in gif-
       flip.

       No support for resizing or odd-angle rotations yet.

       The `color' suffix of text is a no-op, because the
       present version of gifovly throws away color tables.

       Error checking is rudimentary.
