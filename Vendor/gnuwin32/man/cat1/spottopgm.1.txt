NAME
       spottopgm - convert SPOT satellite images to a PGM image


SYNTAX
       spottopgm [-1|-2|-3] [Firstcol Firstline  Lastcol  Last-
       line] inputfile


OPTIONS
       -1

       -2

       -3     Extract the given color from the SPOT image.  The
              colors are infrared, visible light, and ultravio-
              let,  although  I don't know which corresponds to
              which number.  If the image is  in  color,  spot-
              topgm  announces  this  on  Standard  Error.  The
              default color is 1.





PARAMETERS
       Firstcol Firstline Lastcol Lastline
              Extract the specified  rectangle  from  the  SPOT
              image.   Most SPOT images are 3000 lines long and
              3000 or more  columns  wide.  Unfortunately,  the
              SPOT  format  only  gives  the  width and not the
              length.  The width is printed on standard  error.
              The  default  rectangle is the width of the input
              image by 3000 lines.




DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       spottopgm converts the named inputfile  to  PGM  format,
       defaulting  to  the first color and the whole SPOT image
       unless you specify otherwise with the options.


LIMITATIONS
       spottopgm doesn't determine  the  length  of  the  input
       file; this would involve two passes over the input file.
       It defaults to 3000 lines instead.

       spottopgm could extract a three-color image (as a  PPM),
       but  I  didn't feel like making the program more compli-
       cated than it is now.  Besides, there is  no  one-to-one
       correspondence  between  red,  green, blue and infrared,
       visible and ultraviolet.

       I've had only a limited number of SPOT  images  to  play
       with,  and  therefore  wouldn't guarantee that this will
       work on any other images.
