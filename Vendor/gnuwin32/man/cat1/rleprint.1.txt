       printed on a single line.  For example, a count  of  all
       the unique pixel values in the file could be obtained by
       rleprint pic.rle | sort -u | wc

       infile The input will be read from this file.  If infile
              is  "-"  or  is  not specified, the input will be
              read from the standard input stream.

OPTIONS
       -a     Print the alpha value (if available) as the  last
              entry on the line.

BUGS
       This  program is of limited utility because of the sheer
       volume of output it generates.
