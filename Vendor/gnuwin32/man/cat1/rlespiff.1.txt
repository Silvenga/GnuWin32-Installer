NAME
       rlespiff - Use simple contrast enhancement to "spiff up"
       an image.

SYNOPSIS
       rlespiff [ -b blacklevel ] [ -s ] [ -t threshold ] [  -w
       whitelevel ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rlespiff "spiffs up" an image by stretching the contrast
       range so that the darkest pixel maps to  black  and  the
       lightest  to  white.  If the -s flag is given, the color
       channels will be treated separately.  This  will  likely
       cause some drastic color shifts.

OPTIONS
       -b blacklevel
              The  darkest  input  pixel will map to this pixel
              value in the output image.  The default is 0.

       -s     If specified, each color channel will  be  mapped
              separately.

       -t threshold
              This argument controls the number of samples of a
              pixel value that should be considered  insignifi-
              cant  (and  will  therefore  be  ignored).  It is
              specified in pixels/million.  A  threshold  of  4
              applied  to  a  512x512 image would mean that any
              value that existed at only  one  pixel  would  be
              ignored.  The default value is 10.

       -w whitelevel
              The  lightest  input pixel will map to this pixel
              value in the output image.  The default is 255.

       -o outfile
              If specified, the output will be written to  this
              file.   If outfile is "-", or if it is not speci-
              fied, the output will be written to the  standard
              output stream.

       infile The input will be read from this file.  If infile
              is "-" or is not specified,  the  input  will  be
              read from the standard input stream.
