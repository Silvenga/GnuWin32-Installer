NAME
       rawtorle - Convert raw image data to RLE.

SYNOPSIS
       rawtorle [ -N ] [ -s ] [ -r ] [ -w width ] [ -h height ]
       [ -f header-size ] [ -t trailer-size ] [ -n nchannels  ]
       [  -a  [  alpha-value ] ] [ -p scanline-pad ] [ -l left-
       scanline-pad ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is used to convert image data in any  of  a
       number  of  "raw"  forms  to  the  RLE(5)  format.   The
       expected input size is computed from the  arguments,  so
       that  several  images  may  be concatenated together and
       will be processed in sequence.  In this case, the output
       file will contain several RLE images.

OPTIONS
       -N     The  input  is in non-interleaved order, as might
              be generated by the command
              cat pic.r pic.g pic.b

       -s     The input is in scanline interleaved order.

       -r     Reverse the channel order.  (E.g., data  will  be
              interpreted as ABGR instead of RGBA.)

       -w width
              Specify the width of the input image.

       -h height
              Specify the height of the input image.

       -f header-size
              This  many  bytes will be skipped before starting
              to read image data.

       -t trailer-size
              This many bytes will be skipped at the end of the
              image data.

       -n nchannels
              The input data has this many color channels.

       -a [alpha-value]
              Generate  a  constant alpha channel.  The default
              value for alpha-value is 255.

       -p scanline-pad
              This many bytes will be skipped  at  the  end  of
              each scanline.

       -l left-scanline-pad
              This  many bytes will be skipped at the beginning
              of each scanline.

       -o outfile
              If specified, output  will  be  written  to  this
              file, otherwise it will go to stdout.

       infile The input will be read from this file, otherwise,
              input will be taken from stdin.

       The input data is assumed to have an  alpha  channel  if
       there  are  2  or  4 channels.  The alpha channel is the
       last input channel unless -r is specified, in which case
       it is the first.

EXAMPLES
       512x512 grayscale
              rawtorle -w 512 -h 512 -n 1

       640x512 raw RGB
              rawtorle -w 640 -h 512 -n 3

       picture.[rgb]
              cat  picture.[rgb]  | rawtorle -w 640 -h 512 -n 3
              -N -r
              (I.e., separate red,  green,  blue  image  files.
              This subsumes graytorle(1).)

       JPL ODL Voyager pics
              rawtorle -w 800 -h 800 -f 2508 -t 1672 -n 1 -p 36

       24bit Sun raster file
              rawtorle -f 32 -w ... -h ... -n 3
              (But rastorle(1) is easier.)

       pic.{000-100}.[rgb]
              cat pic.* | rawtorle -w ... -h ... -n 3 -s -r
              (I.e., each color of each scanline is in a  sepa-
              rate file.)
