NAME
       ppmwheel - make a PPM image of a color wheel


SYNOPSIS
       ppmwheel diameter


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmwheel  produces  a  PPM image of a color wheel of the
       specified diameter inside  a  white  square  just  large
       enough to hold it.

       The  color  wheel is based on the HSV color model.  Hues
       are distributed angularly around the circle and the val-
       ues  are distributed radially and the saturation is zero
       everywhere.  The values are zero at the center, increas-
       ing  linearly to maximum at the edge.  The maximum value
       corresponds to the maxval of the PPM image.

       Hence, the image contains all of  the  secondary  colors
       based  on  the  red,  green, and blue primary colors.  A
       secondary color is one that is composed of light  of  at
       most two of the three primary colors.


OPTIONS
       None.
