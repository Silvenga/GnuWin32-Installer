DESCRIPTION
       Formats the specified ASCII  files  and  produces  Post-
       Script  output  conforming to the Adobe Structuring Con-
       ventions.  The output pages may be in landscape or  por-
       trait  mode,  with  one  or two columns, with or without
       headers.

       If no input files are specified, then input is  accepted
       from stdin.

       Tabs  in  the  input stream are expanded (by default) to
       eight character positions.

       Formfeed (control-L)  characters  in  the  input  stream
       cause  a  new  page  or  column to be started. Form feed
       characters must be at the start start of a line, or pre-
       ceded  only by whitespace. To make formfeeds work at any
       point in the line use the -d option.

       PostScript output is directed to  a  printer  using  lpr
       unless  otherwise  specified  using  the  -p option. The
       printer to use is set by the PRINTER  environment  vari-
       able.  If this is not set, then the printer "Postscript"
       ("prn" for MSDOS) will be used.

       Font specifications are formed from the  font  name  and
       the  font  size,  i.e.   Courier10  specifies a 10 point
       Courier font, and Courier-Bold12 specifies  a  bold,  12
       point Courier font. Sizes can also be given with a deci-
       mal point, i.e.  Courier7.5 specifies a 7.5 point  font,
       this  might  however  result  in a marginal error in the
       size calculations, since a linear approximation  of  the
       character width is done.

       The  NENSCRIPT  environment  variable may be used to set
       default values for most configurable attributes.  Values
       set in this way will be overridden by any options speci-
       fied on the commands line.

       The current version of nenscript is 1.13.


OPTIONS
       -?     -h Print usage message.


       -1     Specifies single column output (default).


       -2     Specifies two column output.


       -B     Turns off page titles.


       -bheader
              Print the text specified by header as  the  title
              on  each  page,  rather  than  the default header
              which is composed of the name of the source file,
              the current time and date and the page number. If
              in gaudy mode, the  title  is  displayed  in  the
              blank area just above the file title.


       -d     Handles  formfeeds  in  the  same way that a dot-
              matrix printer handles them.  Thus a line with  a
              formfeed  in  the  middle  prints the first part,
              starts a new page and then prints the rest of the
              same  line on the first line of the page. In fact
              using this mode to get anything to print  on  the
              top  line,  it  must  be  on the same line as the
              formfeed in the file.


       -ffont Use font for printing text. Only Courier in sizes
              5  to  30  can  be  used  for  printing text. The
              default font  is  Courier10,  unless  two  column
              landscape  mode  is  specified  in which case the
              default font is Courier7.


       -Ftitlefont
              Use titlefont for printing titles.  Any  font  in
              any   point   size   can  be  used  for  printing
              titles.The default font is Courier-Bold10.


       -G     Enable gaudy mode.


       -g     Disable gaudy mode (default).


       -ifiletitle
              Use the specified string as the  displayed  file-
              name. Useful when inputting from stdin.


       -Llines
              Set  the  maximum  number  of lines which will be
              printed per page or column. The actual number  of
              lines which appear may be less depending upon the
              font and paper size.


       -l     Do not set a limit on on the  maximum  number  of
              lines  per  page,  i.e.  the  number  of lines is
              determined by the font size and  the  paper  size
              (default).


       -N     Precede  each line with it's line number relative
              to the start of the file.


       -n     Disable line numbering (default).


       -pfilename
              Direct the PostScript to filename rather than the
              default printer. If '-' is specified as the file-
              name, then the PostScript is sent to stdout.


       -Pprinter
              Overrides the  PRINTER  environment  variable  in
              determining  the  printer  to  spool  output  to.
              Ignored if -p is used.


       -R     Don't rotate the page, i.e.  output  in  portrait
              mode (default).


       -r     Rotate the page, i.e. output in landscape mode.


       -Sclassification
              Prints the string argument in Helvetica-Bold28 at
              the top and bottom of the page in conformance  to
              regulations for printing classified material.


       -U1st_page_classification
              Print  a  different classification header for the
              first page.  Useful  for  marking  banner  sheets
              that  need  to  be  marked with a higher level of
              classification until the document can be reviewed
              and declassified.


       -s     Disable  a previous heading specified with the -S
              option.


       -Tpapertype
              Sets the output paper type as per  the  argument.
              At  the  moment,  only  two  paper types are sup-
              ported: A4 and US. The default paper size will be
              A4,  unless the US_VERSION define is specified at
              compilation time.


       -ttabsize
              Sets the number of  columns  to  which  tabs  are
              expanded. The default is eight columns.


       -V     Display  information  identifying  the version of
              nenscript. Nothing will be printed regardless  of
              the other arguments.


       -W     Truncate lines which are wide for the page.


       -w     Wrap  lines  which are too wide for the page onto
              successive lines (default).   Continuation  lines
              are  marked with + character before the left mar-
              gin.


       -Z     Check the first two characters of the  input  for
              the character string %!. If a match is found, the
              input is copied directly to the  output  with  no
              processing.


       -#copies
              Print each page copies times.


ENVIRONMENT
       PRINTER        Specifies  the  name  of  the  printer to
                      direct PostScript output to. If not  set,
                      the  default  is  a  printer named "Post-
                      Script".


       NENSCRIPT      If defined, this string is  searched  for
                      valid  options  before  the  command line
                      supplied by the user.


BUGS
       As nenscript does not have access to complete PostScript
       font tables, it must use some other technique for calcu-
       lating the number of  characters  that  fit  across  the
       page.  The  solution  was  to  use a fixed table for the
       Courier font in a range of  sizes.  If  this  table  was
       extended, other fonts and sizes could be used for print-
       ing text. Alternatively, if the text processing was done
       on the printer, then there would be no need to know any-
       thing about the font sizes...

       No checking is  performed  on  font  names,  other  than
       checking that only Courier can be specified for the text
       font. If a font is specified that is  not  available  on
       the final printer, the result is undetermined.

       No  checking  is  performed  on the input file to detect
       accidental printing of garbage files. Caveat emptor!

       No mapping of the input characters is performed, so out-
       put  may  vary depending upon the vagaries of downstream
       software and hardware.

       No support for manual feed, page prefeed, mail upon com-
       pletion  or  any  of  the  other  rarely used options of
       enscript.

       No messages are displayed whilst processing.

       Input line lengths are limited to 8192 characters  after
       expansion of tabs.
