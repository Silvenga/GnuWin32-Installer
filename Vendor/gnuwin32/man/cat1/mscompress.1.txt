MSCOMPRESS(1)                                     MSCOMPRESS(1)





NAME
       mscompress - compress data using LZ77 algorithm

SYNOPSIS
       mscompress [ -h ]
       mscompress [ -V ]
       mscompress [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mscompress  reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv
       coding (LZ77).  Each input file  is  compressed  to  file  eding
       with  underscore  and  original  file  remains untouched. Output
       files then can be decompressed using Microsoft EXPAND.EXE  util-
       ity or msexpand(1). In other words, mscompress(1) is binary com-
       patible with Microsoft's COMPRESS.EXE


BUGS
       Mscompress cannot compress standard input  as  gzip(1)  or  com-
       press(1) do.
