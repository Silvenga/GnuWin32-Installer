NAME
       pbmtoascii - convert a PBM image to ASCII graphics


SYNOPSIS
       pbmtoascii

       [-1x2|-2x4]

       [pbmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmtoascii  reads  a  PBM  image as input and produces a
       somewhat crude ASCII graphic image as output.

       To convert back, use asciitopgm(1).


OPTIONS
       The -1x2 and -2x4 flags give you two alternate ways  for
       the  pixels  to get mapped to characters.  With 1x2, the
       default, each character represents a group  of  1  pixel
       across by 2 pixels down.  With -2x4, each character rep-
       resents 2 pixels across by 4 pixels down.  With the  1x2
       mode  you  can see the individual pixels, so it's useful
       for previewing small images on a non-graphics  terminal.
       The  2x4  mode lets you display larger images on a stan-
       dard 80-column  display,  but  it  obscures  pixel-level
       details.   2x4  mode  is  also  good  for displaying PGM
       images:

       pamscale -width 158 | pnmnorm | pamditherbw -threshold

       should give good results.
