NAME
       units - unit conversion program

OVERVIEW OF `UNITS'
       The  `units'  program  converts  quantities expressed in
       various scales to their  equivalents  in  other  scales.
       The  `units'  program  can  handle  multiplicative scale
       changes as well as nonlinear conversions such as Fahren-
       heit to Celsius.  Temperature conversions require a spe-
       cial syntax.  See the examples below.

       The units are defined in an external data file.  You can
       use  the  extensive  data file that comes with this pro-
       gram, or you can provide your own data file to suit your
       needs.

       You  can  use the program interactively with prompts, or
       you can use it from the command line.


INTERACTING WITH `UNITS'
       To invoke units for interactive  use,  type  `units'  at
       your  shell  prompt.   The  program will print something
       like this:

           2131 units, 53 prefixes, 24 nonlinear units

           You have:

       At the `You have:' prompt, type the quantity  and  units
       that  you are converting from.  For example, if you want
       to convert ten meters to feet, type `10 meters'.   Next,
       `units'  will  print  `You  want:'.  You should type the
       type of units you want to convert  to.   To  convert  to
       feet,  you would type `feet'.  Note that if the readline
       library was compiled in then the tab key can be used  to
       complete  unit  names.   See  Readline support, for more
       information about readline.

       The answer will be displayed in  two  ways.   The  first
       line  of  output, which is marked with a `*' to indicate
       multiplication, gives the result of the  conversion  you
       have  asked  for.   The  second line of output, which is
       marked with  a  `/'  to  indicate  division,  gives  the
       inverse  of  the  conversion  factor.  If you convert 10
       meters to feet, `units' will print

               * 32.808399
               / 0.03048

       which tells you that 10 meters equals about  32.8  feet.
       The  second  number gives the conversion in the opposite
       direction.  In this case, it tells you that  1  foot  is
       equal to about 0.03 dekameters since the dekameter is 10
       meters.  It also tells you that 1/32.8 is about .03.

       The `units' program prints the inverse because sometimes
       it  is  a more convenient number.  In the example above,
       for example, the inverse value is an exact conversion: a
       foot is exactly .03048 dekameters.  But the number given
       the other direction is inexact.

       If you try to convert grains to pounds, you will see the
       following:

           You have: grains
           You want: pounds
                   * 0.00014285714
                   / 7000

       From  the  second line of the output you can immediately
       see that a grain is equal to a  seven  thousandth  of  a
       pound.   This  is  not so obvious from the first line of
       the output.  If you find  the output format   confusing,
       try using the `--verbose' option:

           You have: grain
           You want: aeginamina
                   grain = 0.00010416667 aeginamina
                   grain = (1 / 9600) aeginamina

       If  you request a conversion between units which measure
       reciprocal dimensions, then  `units'  will  display  the
       conversion  results  with  an extra note indicating that
       reciprocal conversion has been done:

           You have: 6 ohms
           You want: siemens
                   reciprocal conversion
                   * 0.16666667
                   / 6

       Reciprocal conversion can be  suppressed  by  using  the
       `--strict' option.  As usual, use the `--verbose' option
       to get more comprehensible output:

           You have: tex
           You want: typp
                   reciprocal conversion
                   1 / tex = 496.05465 typp
                   1 / tex = (1 / 0.0020159069) typp

           You have: 20 mph
           You want: sec/mile
                   reciprocal conversion
                   1 / 20 mph = 180 sec/mile
                   1 / 20 mph = (1 / 0.0055555556) sec/mile

       If you enter incompatible unit types, the  `units'  pro-
       gram  will print a message indicating that the units are
       not conformable and it will display the reduced form for
       each unit:

           You have: ergs/hour
           You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
           conformability error
                   2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
                   2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec

       If  you only want to find the reduced form or definition
       of a unit,  simply  press  return  at  the  `You  want:'
       prompt.  Here is an example:

           You have: jansky
           You want:
                   Definition: fluxunit = 1e-26 W/m^2 Hz = 1e-26 kg / s^2

       The  output  from  `units'  indicates that the jansky is
       defined to be equal to  a  fluxunit  which  in  turn  is
       defined  to  be  a certain combination of watts, meters,
       and hertz.  The fully reduced (and in this case somewhat
       more cryptic) form appears on the far right.

       Some  named  units  are treated as dimensionless in some
       situations.  These include  the  radian  and  steradian.
       These  units  will  be  treated  as  equal to 1 in units
       conversions.  Power is equal  to  torque  times  angular
       velocity.   This conversion can only be performed if the
       radian is dimensionless.

           You have: (14 ft lbf) (12 radians/sec)
           You want: watts
                   * 227.77742
                   / 0.0043902509

       Note that named dimensionaless units are not treated  as
       dimensionless in other contexts.  They cannot be used as
       exponents so for example, `meter^radian' is not allowed.

       If  you  want  a list of options you can type `?' at the
       `You want:' prompt.  The program will display a list  of
       named units which are conformable with the unit that you
       entered at the `You have:' prompt above.  Note that con-
       formable unit combinations will not appear on this list.

       Typing `help' at either prompt  displays  a  short  help
       message.   You  can  also type `help' followed by a unit
       name.  This will invoke a pager on the units  data  base
       at  the  point where that unit is defined.  You can read
       the definition and comments that may give  more  details
       or historical information about the unit.

       Typing  `search  text' will display a list of all of the
       units whose names contain `text' as  a  substring  along
       with their definitions.  This may help in the case where
       you aren't sure of the right unit name.


USING `UNITS' NON-INTERACTIVELY
       The `units' program can perform units  conversions  non-
       interactively  from  the command line.  To do this, type
       the command, type the  original  units  expression,  and
       type  the new units you want.  You will probably need to
       protect the units expressions from interpretation by the
       shell using single quote characters.

       If you type

           units '2 liters' 'quarts'

       then `units' will print

               * 2.1133764
               / 0.47317647

       and  then  exit.   The output tells you that 2 liters is
       about 2.1 quarts, or alternatively that a quart is about
       0.47 times 2 liters.

       If  the  conversion  is  successful,  then  `units' will
       return success  (0)  to  the  calling  environment.   If
       `units'  is  given  non-conformable units to convert, it
       will print a message giving the  reduced  form  of  each
       unit and it will return failure (nonzero) to the calling
       environment.

       When `units' is invoked with only one argument, it  will
       print out the definition of the specified unit.  It will
       return failure if the unit is not defined and success if
       the unit is defined.


UNIT EXPRESSIONS
       In  order  to enter more complicated units or fractions,
       you will need to use operations such as powers, products
       and  division.   Powers  of units can be specified using
       the `^' character as shown in the following example,  or
       by  simple concatenation: `cm3' is equivalent to `cm^3'.
       If the exponent is more  than  one  digit,  the  `^'  is
       required.   An  exponent like `2^3^2' is evaluated right
       to left.  The `^' operator has the second highest prece-
       dence.   The `**' operator is provided as an alternative
       exponent operator.

           You have: cm^3
           You want: gallons
                   * 0.00026417205
                   / 3785.4118

           You have: arabicfoot * arabictradepound * force
           You want: ft lbf
                   * 0.7296
                   / 1.370614

       Multiplication  of  units  can  be  specified  by  using
       spaces,  or  an  asterisk  (`*').  If `units' is invoked
       with the `--product' option then the hyphen  (`-')  also
       acts as a multiplication operator.  Division of units is
       indicated by the slash (`/') or by `per'.

           You have: furlongs per fortnight
           You want: m/s
                   * 0.00016630986
                   / 6012.8727

       Historically, multiplication in  units  was  assigned  a
       higher  precedence  than  division.  This disagrees with
       the usual precedence rules which give multiplication and
       division  equal  precedence, and it has been a source of
       confusion for people who think of units as a calculator.

       By  default, multiplication using the star (`*') now has
       the same precedence as division and  hence  follows  the
       usual  precedence  rules.   If units is invoked with the
       the `--oldstar' option then then  the  old  behavior  is
       activated  and  `*' will have the same precedence as the
       other multiplication operators described next.

       Multiplication using a space or using the hyphen  has  a
       higher precedence than division and is evaluated left to
       right.  So @samp{m/s s/day} is equivalent to `m  /  s  s
       day' and has dimensions of length per time cubed.  Simi-
       larly, `1/2 meter' refers to a unit of reciprocal length
       equivalent  to  .5/meter, which is probably not what you
       would intend if you entered that expression.

       You can indicate division of numbers with  the  vertical
       dash  (`|'),  so  if  you  wanted half a meter you could
       write @samp{1|2 meter}.  This operator has  the  highest
       precedence  so  the  square  root of two thirds could be
       written `2|3^1|2'.

           You have: 1|2 inch
           You want: cm
                   * 1.27
                   / 0.78740157

       Parentheses can be used for grouping as desired.

           You have: (1/2) kg / (kg/meter)
           You want: league
                   * 0.00010356166
                   / 9656.0833

       Prefixes are defined separately  from  base  units.   In
       order  to  get  centimeters,  the units database defines
       `centi-' and `c-'  as  prefixes.   Prefixes  can  appear
       alone  with no unit following them.  An exponent applies
       only to the immediately preceding unit and its prefix so
       that `cm^3' or `centimeter^3' refer to cubic centimeters
       but  `centi*meter^3'  refers  to  hundredths  of   cubic
       meters.   Only  one  prefix  is  permitted  per unit, so
       `micromicrofarad' will fail, but `micro*microfarad' will
       work, as will `micro microfarad'..

       For  `units',  numbers  are  just  another kind of unit.
       They can appear as many times as you  like  and  in  any
       order  in  a  unit expression.  For example, to find the
       volume of a box which is 2 ft  by  3  ft  by  12  ft  in
       steres, you could do the following:

           You have: 2 ft 3 ft 12 ft
           You want: stere
                   * 2.038813
                   / 0.49048148

           You have: $ 5 / yard
           You want: cents / inch
                   * 13.888889
                   / 0.072

       And  the second example shows how the dollar sign in the
       units conversion can  precede  the  five.   Be  careful:
       `units'  will interpret `$5' with no space as equivalent
       to dollars^5.

       Outside of the SI system, it is often desirable  to  add
       values  of  different units together.  You may also wish
       to use `units' as  a  calculator  that  keeps  track  of
       units.   Sums  of conformable units are written with the
       `+' character.

           You have: 2 hours + 23 minutes + 32 seconds
           You want: seconds
                   * 8612
                   / 0.00011611705

           You have: 12 ft + 3 in
           You want: cm
                   * 373.38
                   / 0.0026782366

           You have: 2 btu + 450 ft lbf
           You want: btu
                   * 2.5782804
                   / 0.38785542

       The expressions which are added together must reduce  to
       identical  expressions  in  primitive units, or an error
       message will be displayed:

           You have: 12 printerspoint + 4 heredium
                                                 ^
           Illegal sum of non-conformable units

       Historically `-' has been used for  products  of  units,
       which complicates its iterpretation in `units'.  Because
       `units' provides several other ways to obtain unit prod-
       ucts,  and because `-' is a subtraction operator in gen-
       eral algebraic expressions, `units'  treats  the  binary
       `-' as a subtraction operator by default.  This behavior
       can be altered using the `--product' option which causes
       `units'  to  treat  the binary `-' operator as a product
       operator.  Note that when `-' is a multiplication opera-
       tor it has the same precedence as `*', but when `-' is a
       subtraction operator it has the lower precedence as  the
       addition operator.

       When  `-'  is  used  as  a unary operator it negates its
       operand.  Regardless of  the  `units'  options,  if  `-'
       appears  after  `('  or  after `+' then it will act as a
       negation operator.  So you can always compute 20 degrees
       minus  12 minutes by entering `20 degrees + -12 arcmin'.
       You must use this construction when you define new units
       because  you  cannot  know what options will be in force
       when your definition is processed.

       The `+' character sometimes appears  in  exponents  like
       `3.43e+8'.   This leads to an ambiguity in an expression
       like `3e+2 yC'.  The unit `e' is a small unit of charge,
       so  this can be regarded as equivalent to `(3e+2) yC' or
       `(3 e)+(2 yC)'.  This ambiguity is  resolved  by  always
       interpreting `+' as part of an exponent if possible.

       Several  built  in functions are provided: `sin', `cos',
       `tan', `ln', `log', `log2', `exp',  `acos',  `atan'  and
       `asin'.   The  `sin', `cos', and `tan' functions require
       either a dimensionless  argument  or  an  argument  with
       dimensions of angle.

           You have: sin(30 degrees)
           You want:
                   Definition: 0.5

           You have: sin(pi/2)
           You want:
                   Definition: 1

           You have: sin(3 kg)
                             ^
           Unit not dimensionless

       The  other  functions  on the list require dimensionless
       arguments.  The inverse trigonometric  functions  return
       arguments with dimensions of angle.

       If  you  wish  to  take  roots of units, you may use the
       `sqrt' or `cuberoot' functions.  These functions require
       that  the  argument  have  the appropriate root.  Higher
       roots can  be obtained by using fractional exponents:

           You have: sqrt(acre)
           You want: feet
                   * 208.71074
                   / 0.0047913202

           You have: (400 W/m^2 / stefanboltzmann)^(1/4)
           You have:
                   Definition: 289.80882 K

           You have: cuberoot(hectare)

           Unit not a root

       Nonlinear units are represented using  functional  nota-
       tion.   They  make  possible  nonlinear unit conversions
       such temperature.  This is  different  from  the  linear
       units  that  convert  temperature differences.  Note the
       difference below.  The absolute temperature  conversions
       are  handled by units starting with `temp', and you must
       use functional notation.   The  temperature  differences
       are done using units starting with `deg' and they do not
       require functional notation.

           You have: tempF(45)
           You want: tempC
                   7.2222222

           You have: 45 degF
           You want: degC
                   * 25
                   / 0.04

       Think of `tempF(x)' not as a function but as a  notation
       which  indicates  that  `x' should have units of `tempF'
       attached to it.  See Nonlinear units.  The first conver-
       sion  shows  that  if it's 45 degrees Fahrehneit outside
       it's 7.2 degrees Celsius.  The second conversions  indi-
       cates that a change of 45 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds
       to a change of 25 degrees Celsius.

       Some other examples of nonlinears units  are  ring  size
       and wire gauge.  There are numerous different gauges and
       ring sizes.  See the units database  for  more  details.
       Note that wire gauges with multiple zeroes are signified
       using negative numbers where two zeroes is -1.  Alterna-
       tively,  you  can use the synonyms `g00', `g000', and so
       on that are defined in the units database.

           You have: wiregauge(11)
           You want: inches

           You have: brwiregauge(g00)
           You want: inches

INVOKING `UNITS'
       You invoke `units' like this:

           units [OPTIONS] [FROM-UNIT [TO-UNIT]]

       If the FROM-UNIT and TO-UNIT are omitted, then the  pro-
       gram  will  use  interactive  prompts to determine which
       conversions to perform.  See Interactive use.   If  both
       FROM-UNIT  and TO-UNIT are given, `units' will print the
       result of that single conversion and then exit.  If only
       FROM-UNIT appears on the command line, `units' will dis-
       play the definition of that unit and exit.  Units speci-
       fied  on the command line will need to be quoted to pro-
       tect them from shell interpretation and  to  group  them
       into two arguments.  See Command line use.

       The  following  options allow you to read in an alterna-
       tive units file, check your units file,  or  change  the
       output format:


       -c, --check
              Check  that all units and prefixes defined in the
              units data file reduce to primitive units.  Print
              a list of all units that cannot be reduced.  Also
              display some other diagnostics  about  suspicious
              definitions  in  the  units data file.  Note that
              only definitions active in the current locale are
              checked.


       --check-verbose
              Like  the  `-check'  option, this option prints a
              list of units that cannot  be  reduced.   But  to
              help  find  unit   definitions that cause endless
              loops, it lists the units as  they  are  checked.
              If  `units'  hangs,  then  the  last  unit  to be
              printed has a bad  definition.   Note  that  only
              definitions  active  in  the  current  locale are
              checked.


       -o format, --output-format format
              Use the  specified  format  for  numeric  output.
              Format  is  the same as that for the printf func-
              tion in the ANSI C standard.  For example, if you
              want more precision you might use `-o %.15g'.


       -f filename, --file filename
              Instruct  `units'  to  load the units file `file-
              name'.  If `filename' is the  empty  string  (`-f
              "')  then  the default units file will be loaded.
              This enables you to load the default file plus  a
              personal units file.  Up to 25 units files may be
              specified on the command line.  This option over-
              rides the `UNITSFILE' environment variable.


       -h, --help
              Print out a summary of the options for `units'.


       -m, --minus
              Causes  `-'  to  be  interpreted as a subtraction
              operator.  This is usually the default  behavior.


       -p, --product
              Causes  `-' to be interpreted as a multiplication
              operator when it has two operands.  It will as  a
              negation  operator  when it has only one operand:
              `(-3)'.  Note that by default `-' is treated as a
              subtraction operator.

       , --oldstar Causes `*' to have the old style precedence,
       higher than the precedence of division so  that  `1/2*3'
       will equal `6'.

       ,  --newstar Forces `*' to have the new (default) prece-
       dence which follows the  usual  rules  of  algebra:  the
       precedence  of `*' is the same as the precedence of `/',
       so that `1/2*3' will equal `3/2'.

       , --compact Give compact output featuring only the  con-
       version  factor.  This turns off the `--verbose' option.


       -q, --quiet, --silent
              Suppress prompting of the user for units and  the
              display  of  statistics about the number of units
              loaded.


       -s, --strict
              Suppress conversion of units to their  reciprocal
              units.   For  example, `units' will normally con-
              vert hertz to seconds  because  these  units  are
              reciprocals  of  each  other.   The strict option
              requires that units be  strictly  conformable  to
              perform  a  conversion, and will give an error if
              you attempt to convert hertz to seconds.


       -1, --one-line
              Give only one line of output (the forward conver-
              sion).   Do  not  print  the  reverse conversion.
              Note that if a reciprocal conversion is performed
              then `units' will print still print the "recipro-
              cal conversion" line.


       -t, --terse
              Give terse output when  converting  units.   This
              option  can  be  used  when  calling `units' from
              another program so that the  output  is  easy  to
              parse.   This  option  has the combined effect of
              these options:  `--strict' `--quiet' `--one-line'
              `--compact'.


       -v, --verbose
              Give slightly more verbose output when converting
              units.  When combined with the `-c'  option  this
              gives the same effect as `--check-verbose'.


       -V, --version
              Print  program  version  number, tell whether the
              readline library has been included, and give  the
              location of the default units data file.


UNIT DEFINITIONS
       The  conversion  information  is  read from a units data
       file which is called `units.dat' and is probably located
       in  the  `/usr/local/share'  directory.   If  you invoke
       `units' with the `-V' option, it will print the location
       of this file.  The default file includes definitions for
       all familiar units, abbreviations and  metric  prefixes.
       It also includes many obscure or archaic units.

       Many constants of nature are defined, including these:

              l  l.   pi   ratio  of  circumference to diameter
              c    speed of light e    charge  on  an  electron
              force     acceleration of gravity mole Avogadro's
              number  water     pressure  per  unit  height  of
              water  Hg   pressure  per  unit height of mercury
              au   astronomical unit  k    Boltzman's  constant
              mu0  permeability of vacuum epsilon0  permitivity
              of vacuum G    gravitational constant  mach speed
              of sound
       The  database includes atomic masses for all of the ele-
       ments and numerous other constants.  Also  included  are
       the  densities  of various ingredients used in baking so
       that `2 cups flour_sifted' can be converted to  `grams'.
       This  is not an exhaustive list.  Consult the units data
       file to see the complete list, or to see the definitions
       that are used.

       The  unit `pound' is a unit of mass.  To get force, mul-
       tiply by the force conversion unit `force'  or  use  the
       shorthand `lbf'.  (Note that `g' is already taken as the
       standard abbreviation for the gram.)  The  unit  `ounce'
       is also a unit of mass.  The fluid ounce is `fluidounce'
       or `floz'.  British  capacity  units  that  differ  from
       their US counterparts, such as the British Imperial gal-
       lon, are prefixed with `br'.  Currency is prefixed  with
       its country name: `belgiumfranc', `britainpound'.

       The  US  Survey  foot, yard, and mile can be obtained by
       using the `US' prefix.  These units differ slightly from
       the  international  length  units.  They were in general
       use until 1959, and are still used for  geographic  sur-
       veys.  The acre is officially defined in terms of the US
       Survey foot.  If you want an acre defined  according  to
       the  international  foot, use `intacre'.  The difference
       between these units is about 4 parts per  million.   The
       British  also  used  a slightly different length measure
       before 1959.  These can  be  obtained  with  the  prefix
       `UK'.

       When  searching for a unit, if the specified string does
       not appear exactly as a unit name, then the `units' pro-
       gram  will  try  to  remove a trailing `s' or a trailing
       `es'.  If that fails, `units' will check for  a  prefix.
       All of the standard metric prefixes are defined.

       To  find out what units and prefixes are available, read
       the standard units data file.


DEFINING NEW UNITS
       All of the units and prefixes that `units'  can  convert
       are  defined in the units data file.  If you want to add
       your own units, you can supply your own file.   You  can
       also  add your own units definitions in the `.units.dat'
       file in your home directory.  If this file exists it  is
       read before the units data file.  It will not be read if
       any units files are specified on the command line.

       A unit is specified on a single line by giving its  name
       and  an  equivalence.  Comments start with a `#' charac-
       ter, which can appear anywhere in a line.  The backslash
       character  (`´)  acts  as a continuation character if it
       appears as the last character on a line, making it  pos-
       sible  to  spread  definitions out over several lines if
       desired.  A file can be included by giving  the  command
       `!include'  followed  by the file's name.  The file will
       be sought in the  same  directory  as  the  parent  file
       unless a full path is given.

       Unit  names must not contain any of the operator charac-
       ters `+', `-', `*', `/', `|', `^'  or  the  parentheses.
       They cannot begin with a digit or a decimal point (`.'),
       nor can they end with a digit  (except  for  zero).   Be
       careful to define new units in terms of old ones so that
       a reduction leads to  the  primitive  units,  which  are
       marked  with  `!'  characters.   Dimensionless units are
       indicated by using the string `!dimensionless'  for  the
       unit definition.

       When adding new units, be sure to use the `-c' option to
       check that the new units reduce properly.  If you create
       a  loop in the units definitions, then `units' will hang
       when invoked with the `-c' options.  You  will  need  to
       use  the  `--check-verbose' option which prints out each
       unit as it checks them.  The program  will  still  hang,
       but  the last unit printed will be the unit which caused
       the infinite loop.

       If you define any units which  contain  `+'  characters,
       carefully  check  them  because the `-c' option will not
       catch non-conformable sums.  Be  careful  with  the  `-'
       operator  as  well.  When used as a binary operator, the
       `-' character can  perform  addition  or  multiplication
       depending  on  the  options  used to invoke `units'.  To
       ensure consistent behavior use `-' only as a unary nega-
       tion operator when writing units definitions.  To multi-
       ply two units leave a space or use the `*' operator with
       care, recalling that it has two possible precedence val-
       ues and may require  parentheses  to  ensure  consistent
       behavior.   To compute the difference of `foo' and `bar'
       write `foo+(-bar)' or even `foo+-bar'.

       Here is an example of a short units  file  that  defines
       some basic units:

              l l l.  m    !    # The meter is a primitive unit
              sec  !    #  The  second  is  a  primitive   unit
              rad  !dimensionless #  The  second is a primitive
              unit    micro-    1e-6 #    Define    a    prefix
              minute    60  sec   #  A  minute  is  60  seconds
              hour 60  min    #   An   hour   is   60   minutes
              inch 0.0254  m  # Inch defined in terms of meters
              ft   12 inches # The foot  defined  in  terms  of
              inches mile 5280 ft   # And the mile

                     A  unit which ends with a `-' character is
                     a prefix.  If a prefix definition contains
                     any  `/' characters, be sure they are pro-
                     tected  by  parentheses.   If  you  define
                     `half-  1/2'  then  `halfmeter'  would  be
                     equivalent to `1 / 2 meter'.


DEFINING NONLINEAR UNITS
       Some units conversions of interest  are  nonlinear;  for
       example,  temperature conversions between the Fahrenheit
       and Celsius scales cannot be done by simply  multiplying
       by conversions factors.

       When  you  give  a  linear unit definition such as `inch
       2.54 cm' you are providing information that `units' uses
       to  convert  values  in  inches  into primitive units of
       meters.  For nonlinear units, you give a functional def-
       inition that provides the same information.

       Nonlinear units are represented using a functional nota-
       tion.  It is best to regard this notation not as a func-
       tion call but as a way of adding units to a number, much
       the same way that writing a linear  unit  name  after  a
       number adds units to that number.  Internally, nonlinear
       units are defined by a pair of functions  which  convert
       to  and  from  linear units in the data file, so that an
       eventual conversion to primitive units is possible.

       Here is an example nonlinear unit definition:

       tempF(x) [1;K] (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp ; (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32

       A nonlinear unit definition comprises  a  unit  name,  a
       dummy parameter name, two functions, and two correspond-
       ing units.  The functions tell `units' how to convert to
       and  from  the  new  unit.   In  order  to produce valid
       results, the arguments of these functions need  to  have
       the  correct  dimensions.  To facilitate error checking,
       you may specify the dimensions.

       The definition begins with the unit name followed  imme-
       diately  (with no spaces) by a `(' character.  In paren-
       theses is  the  name  of  the  parameter.   Next  is  an
       optional  specification  of  the  units  required by the
       functions in this definition.  In the example above, the
       `tempF'  function requires an input argument conformable
       with `1'.  For normal nonlinear  units  definitions  the
       forward  function will always take a dimensionless argu-
       ment.  The inverse function requires an  input  argument
       conformable  with  `K'.  In general the inverse function
       will need units that match the quantity measured by your
       nonlinear  unit.   The sole purpose of the expression in
       brackets to enable `units' to perform error checking  on
       function arguments.

       Next  the  function  definitions appear.  In the example
       above, the `tempF' function is defined by

           tempF(x) = (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp

       This gives a  rule  for  converting  `x'  in  the  units
       `tempF'  to  linear units of absolute temperature, which
       makes it possible to convert from tempF to other  units.

       In order to make conversions to Fahrenheit possible, you
       must give  a  rule  for  the  inverse  conversions.  The
       inverse  will  be  `x(tempF)' and its definition appears
       after a `;' character.  In our example, the inverse is

           x(tempF) = (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32

       This inverse definition takes an absolute temperature as
       its  argument and converts it to the Fahrenheit tempera-
       ture.  The inverse can be omitted by leaving out the `;'
       character,  but  then  conversions  to  the unit will be
       impossible.   If  the  inverse  is  omitted   then   the
       `--check'  option  will  display a warning.  It is up to
       you to calculate and enter the correct inverse  function
       to  obtain  proper  conversions.   The  `--check' option
       tests the inverse at one point and print an error if  it
       is  not  valid  there,  but this is not a guarantee that
       your inverse is correct.

       If you wish to make synonyms for  nonlinear  units,  you
       still  need to define both the forward and inverse func-
       tions.  Inverse functions can be obtained using the  `~'
       operator.   So to create a synonym for `tempF' you could
       write

           fahrenheit(x) [1;K] tempF(x); ~tempF(fahrenheit)

       You may occasionally wish  to  define  a  function  that
       operates  on  units.  This can be done using a nonlinear
       unit definition.  For example, the definition below pro-
       vides  conversion  between radius and the area of a cir-
       cle.  Note that this definition  requires  a  length  as
       input  and  produces  an area as output, as indicated by
       the specification in brackets.

           circlearea(r) [m;m^2] pi r^2 ; sqrt(circlearea/pi)

       Sometimes you may be interested in  a  piecewise  linear
       unit  such  as many wire gauges.  Piecewise linear units
       can be defined by specifying conversions to linear units
       on a list of points.  Conversion at other points will be
       done by linear interpolation.  A partial  definition  of
       zinc gauge is

           zincgauge[in] 1 0.002, 10 0.02, 15 0.04, 19 0.06, 23 0.1

       In  this  example, `zincgauge' is the name of the piece-
       wise linear unit.  The definition  of  such  a  unit  is
       indicated  by  the  embedded  `['  character.  After the
       bracket, you should indicate the units to be attached to
       the  numbers  in the table.  No spaces can appear before
       the `]' character, so a definition like `foo[kg meters]'
       is illegal; instead write `foo[kg*meters]'.  The defini-
       tion of the unit consists of a list of pairs  optionally
       separated  by  commas.  This list defines a function for
       converting from the  piecewise  linear  unit  to  linear
       units.   The  first  item  in  each pair is the function
       argument; the second item is the value of  the  function
       at  that  argument (in the units specified in brackets).
       In this example, we define `zincgauge' at  five  points.
       For  example, we set `zincgauge(1)' equal to `0.002 in'.
       Definitions like this may be  more readable  if  written
       using  continuation characters as
              zincgauge[in]         \
                      1        0.002 \
                      10        0.02 \
                      15        0.04 \
                      19        0.06 \
                      23        0.1

       With the preceeding definition, the following conversion
       can be performed:

           You have: zincgauge(10)
           You want: in
               * 0.02
               / 50
           You have: .01 inch
           You want: zincgauge
               5

       If you define  a  piecewise  linear  unit  that  is  not
       strictly  monotonic,  then  the inverse will not be well
       defined.  If the inverse is requested for such  a  unit,
       `units' will return the smallest inverse.  The `--check'
       option will print a warning if a non-monotonic piecewise
       linear unit is encountered.


LOCALIZATION
       Some units have different values in different locations.
       The localization feature accomodates  this  by  allowing
       the  units  database to specify region dependent defini-
       tions.   A locale region in the  units  database  begins
       with  `!locale' followed by the name of the locale.  The
       leading `!' must appear in the first column of the units
       database.   The  locale region is terminated by `!endlo-
       cale'.  The following example shows how to define a cou-
       ple units in a locale.

       !locale en_GB
       ton                     brton
       gallon                  brgallon
       !endlocale

       The current locale is specified by the `LOCALE' environ-
       ment variable.  Note that the `-c'  option  only  checks
       the definitions which are active for the current locale.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The `units'  programs  uses  the  following  environment
       variables.


       LOCALE Specifies  the  locale.   The default is `en_US'.
              Sections of the units database  are  specific  to
              certain locales.


       PAGER  Specifies  the pager to use for help and for dis-
              playing the conformable units.  The help function
              browses  the  units  database and calls the pager
              using the `+nn' syntax for specifying a line num-
              ber.   The  default  pager is `more', but `less',
              `emacs', or `vi' are possible alternatives.


       UNITSFILE
              Specifies the units database file to use (instead
              of  the  default). This will be overridden by the
              `-f' option.  Note that you can  only  specify  a
              single  units  database  using  this  environment
              variable.


READLINE SUPPORT
       If the `readline' package has  been  compiled  in,  then
       when  `units'  is  used  interactively, numerous command
       line editing features are available.  To check  if  your
       version  of  `units'  includes  the readline, invoke the
       program with the `--version' option.

       For complete information  about  readline,  consult  the
       documentation  for  the  readline  package.  Without any
       configuration, `units' will allow editing in  the  style
       of  emacs.   Of particular use with `units' are the com-
       pletion commands.

       If you type a few characters and then hit `ESC' followed
       by  the  `?' key then `units' will display a list of all
       the units which start with the  characters  typed.   For
       example, if you type `metr' and then request completion,
       you will see something like this:

       You have: metr
       metre             metriccup         metrichorsepower  metrictenth
       metretes          metricfifth       metricounce       metricton
       metriccarat       metricgrain       metricquart       metricyarncount
       You have: metr

       If there is a unique way to complete a unitname, you can
       hit the tab key and `units' will provide the rest of the
       unit name.  If `units' beeps, it means that there is  no
       unique  completion.   Pressing the tab key a second time
       will print the list of all completions.
