RLEHISTO(1)                                         RLEHISTO(1)





NAME
       rlehisto - generate histogram of RLE image.

SYNOPSIS
       rlehisto [ -b ] [ -c ] [ -t ] [ -h height ] [ -o outfile
       ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rlehisto counts the pixel values in an RLE file, produc-
       ing  an  RLE file graphing frequency of occurrence.  The
       horizontal axis runs from pixel value 0 on the  left  to
       pixel  value 255 on the right.  The height indicates the
       number of pixels seen for each pixel value.   Histograms
       are  computed  independently  for  each  channel, scaled
       identically, and then overlaid.

       The following options are available:

       -b     Don't count  the  background  pixel  values  when
              scaling  the  histogram.   This is useful if most
              pixels are colored the background color, so  that
              the  interesting  part  of the histogram would be
              too small.  This option is ignored if -c is spec-
              ified.

       -c     Output cumulative values instead of discrete val-
              ues.

       -t     Print the totals instead of generating  the  his-
              togram as an RLE file.

       -h     height  Scale  the  output image to the specified
              height.  The default is 256.

       -o outfile
              Direct the output to outfile.
