NAME
       yuvtoppm - convert Abekas YUV bytes to PPM


SYNOPSIS
       yuvtoppm

       width height [imagedata]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       yuvtoppm  reads  raw  Abekas YUV bytes as input and pro-
       duces a PPM image as output.  The input file is just YUV
       bytes.   You have to specify the width and height on the
       command line, since the program obviously can't get them
       from the file.  yuvotppm assumes the maxval of the input
       is 255.
