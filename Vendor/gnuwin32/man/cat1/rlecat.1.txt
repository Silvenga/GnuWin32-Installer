RLECAT(1)                                             RLECAT(1)





NAME
       rlecat - concatenate and repeat images.

SYNOPSIS
       rlecat [ -c ] [ -n repeat-count ] [ -o outfile ] [ files
       ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program  will  concatenate  all  the  input  RLE(5)
       images,  adding  titles,  and  optionally  repeating the
       images a specified number  of  times.   For  each  input
       file,  it  copies  all images to the output file.  If an
       image does not have a title or TITLE  comment,  and  the
       input  is  not  coming from the standard input, then the
       file name (and an image number, if it is not  the  first
       image  in the file) is added as a TITLE comment.  If the
       input file were  named  'images.rle',  the  first  image
       would  be  given  a comment TITLE=images.rle, the second
       would get a comment TITLE=images.rle(2), and so on.

OPTIONS
       -c     With -n, specifies that the output images  should
              be   "collated".   In  other  words,  the  repeat
              sequence will be 1 2 3 ... 1 2 3 ...  instead  of
              the default of 1 1 ... 2 2 ... 3 3 ...

       -n repeat-count
              Specifies   that   each  input  image  should  be
              repeated repeat-count times.  The  "repeat  unit"
              (if  -c is specified, this is the entire concate-
              nated sequence of input images, otherwise  it  is
              just each image, separately) is written to a tem-
              porary file, and then copied to  the  output  the
              requisite number of times.

       -o outfile
              If  specified, the output will be written to this
              file.  If outfile is "-", or if it is not  speci-
              fied,  the output will be written to the standard
              output stream.

       files  The input will be read from these  files.   If  a
              file  name  is  "-",  or  none are specified, the
              input  will  be  read  from  the  standard  input
              stream.

EXAMPLES
       rlebg 128 128 128 | rlecat -n 25
              Generates  25 copies of a gray background; useful
              for using rlecomp(1) to put background on an ani-
              mation sequence (with 25 or fewer frames).

       rlecat *.rle | <some processing> | getx11
              Adds  TITLE comments so the individual images are
              correctly identified by getx11(1).

       rlecat -c -r 3 anim*.rle
              Generates an animation  with  3  repeats  of  the
              action.

       rlecat -r 3 anim*.rle
              Generates  a  "triple-framed"  animation  -  each
              frame is repeated 3 times.

BUGS
       If the /tmp directory is not writable, or  if  there  is
       not  sufficient space on /tmp to hold a repeat unit, the
       program will not work correctly.
