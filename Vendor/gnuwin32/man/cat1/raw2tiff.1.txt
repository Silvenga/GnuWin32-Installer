NAME
       raw2tiff - create a TIFF file from a raw data

SYNOPSIS
       raw2tiff [ options ] input.raw output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       raw2tiff  converts  a  raw  byte sequence into TIFF.  By
       default, the TIFF image is  created  with  data  samples
       packed   (PlanarConfiguration=1),  compressed  with  the
       PackBits algorithm (Compression=32773),  and  with  each
       strip  no  more than 8 kilobytes.  These characteristics
       can overridden, or explicitly specified with the options
       described below.

OPTIONS
       -H <number>
              size  of  input  image file header in bytes (0 by
              default).  This  amount  of  data  just  will  be
              skipped from the start of file while reading.

       -w <number>
              width  of  input image in pixels (can be guessed,
              see GUESSING THE IMAGE GEOMETRY below).

       -l <number>
              length of input image in  lines(can  be  guessed,
              see GUESSING THE IMAGE GEOMETRY below).

       -b <number>
              number of bands in input image (1 by default).

       -d data_type
              type  of  samples in input image, where data_type
              may be:
              byte       8-bit unsigned integer (default),
              short      16-bit unsigned integer,
              long       32-bit unsigned integer,
              sbyte      8-bit signed integer,
              sshort     16-bit signed integer,
              slong      32-bit signed integer,
              float      32-bit IEEE floating point,
              double     64-bit IEEE floating point,

       -i config
              type of  samples  interleaving  in  input  image,
              where config may be:
              pixel      pixel interleaved data (default),
              band       band interleaved data.

       -p photo
              photometric  interpretation  (color space) of the
              input image, where photo may be:
              miniswhite white color represented with 0 value,
              minisblack black color represented with  0  value
              (default),
              rgb        image has RGB color model,
              cmyk         image  has  CMYK  (separated)  color
              model,
              ycbcr           image has YCbCr color model,
              cielab     image has CIE L*a*b color model,
              icclab     image has ICC L*a*b color model,
              itulab     image has ITU L*a*b color model,

       -s     swap bytes fetched from the input file.

       -L     input data has LSB2MSB bit order (default).

       -M     input data has MSB2LSB bit order.

       -c     Specify a compression scheme to use when  writing
              image  data: -c none for no compression, -c pack-
              bits for the PackBits compression algorithm  (the
              default),  -c jpeg for the baseline JPEG compres-
              sion algorithm, -c zip for the  Deflate  compres-
              sion  algorithm,  and  -c  lzw  for  Lempel-Ziv &
              Welch.

       -r <number>
              Write data with a specified number  of  rows  per
              strip;  by  default  the  number of rows/strip is
              selected so that each strip  is  approximately  8
              kilobytes.

GUESSING THE IMAGE GEOMETRY
       raw2tiff can guess image width and height in case one or
       both of these parameters are not specified. If you  omit
       one  of  those parameters, the complementary one will be
       calculated based on the file size (taking  into  account
       header size, number of bands and data type). If you omit
       both parameters, the statistical approach will be  used.
       Utility will compute correlation coefficient between two
       lines at the image center using several appropriate line
       sizes  and the highest absolute value of the coefficient
       will indicate the right  line  size.  That  is  why  you
       should  be  cautious with the very large images, because
       guessing process may take a  while  (depending  on  your
       system  performance). Of course, the utility can't guess
       the header size, number of bands and data  type,  so  it
       should be specified manually. If you don't know anything
       about your image, just try with the several combinations
       of those options.

       There is no magic, it is just a mathematical statistics,
       so it can be wrong in some cases. But for most  ordinary
       images guessing method will work fine.
