RLETOGIF(1)                                         RLETOGIF(1)





NAME
       rletogif - Convert RLE files to GIF format.

SYNOPSIS
       rletogif [ -o outfile.gif ] [ infile.rle ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  converts an RLE(5) image file to GIF for-
       mat.  The input file must be a single  channel  (8  bit)
       image.   Three  channel (24 bit) images can be converted
       to single channel images  using  the  programs  tobw(1),
       to8(1),  mcut(1),  or rlequant(1).  The input image will
       be flipped vertically, since the GIF origin  is  in  the
       upper  left,  and  the  RLE origin is in the lower left.
       Only a single image will be converted.

OPTIONS
       -o outfile.gif
              If specified, the output will be written to  this
              file.   If  outfile.gif  is  "-", or if it is not
              specified, the output  will  be  written  to  the
              standard output stream.

       infile.rle
              The  input  will  be  read  from  this  file.  If
              infile.rle is "-" or is not specified, the  input
              will be read from the standard input stream.
