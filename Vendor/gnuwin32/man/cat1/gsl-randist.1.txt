GSL-RANDIST(1)                                                  GSL-RANDIST(1)



NAME
       gsl-randist  - generate random samples from various dis-
       tributions

SYNOPSYS
       gsl-randist seed n DIST param1 param2 [..]

DESCRIPTION
       gsl-randist is a demonstration program for the GNU  Sci-
       entific Library.  It generates n random samples from the
       distribution  DIST  using  the  distribution  parameters
       param1, param2, ...

EXAMPLE
       Here  is  an  example.  We generate 10000 random samples
       from a Cauchy distribution with a width of 30  and  his-
       togram  them over the range -100 to 100, using 200 bins.

            gsl-randist 0 10000 cauchy 30 | gsl-histogram  -100
       100 200 > histogram.dat

       A plot of the resulting histogram will show the familiar
       shape  of  the  Cauchy  distribution  with  fluctuations
       caused by the finite sample size.

            awk '{print $1, $3 ; print $2, $3}' histogram.dat |
       graph -T X
