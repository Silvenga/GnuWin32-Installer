NAME
       ppmntsc  -  Make  RGB colors legal for NTSC or PAL color
       systems.


SYNOPSIS
       ppmntsc

       [--pal] [--legalonly] [--illegalonly]  [--correctedonly]
       [--verbose] [--debug] [infile]

       Minimum  unique abbreviations of options are acceptable.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       This program makes colors legal in  the  NTSC  (or  PAL)
       color  systems.  Often, images generated on the computer
       are made for use in movies which ultimately  end  up  on
       video  tape.  However, the range of colors (as specified
       by their RGB values) on a computer does  not  match  the
       range  of  colors that can be represented using the NTSC
       (or PAL) systems.  If an image with 'illegal' colors  is
       sent  directly  to  an  NTSC  (or  PAL) video system for
       recording, the 'illegal' colors will be  clipped.   This
       may result in an undesirable looking picture.

       This  utility  tests each pixel in an image to see if it
       falls within the legal NTSC (or PAL) range.  If not,  it
       raises or lowers the pixel's saturation in the output so
       that it does fall within legal limits.  Pixels that  are
       already OK just go unmodified into the output.

       Input  is  from  the  file  named input.  If input is -,
       input is from Standard  Input.   If  you  don't  specify
       input, input is from Standard Input.

       Output is always to Standard Output.

       This  program  handles  multi-image PPM input, producing
       multi-image PPM output.


OPTIONS
       --pal  Use the PAL  transform  instead  of  the  default
              NTSC.


       --verbose
              Print a grand total of the number of illegal pix-
              els.


       --debug
              Produce a humongous listing of illegal colors and
              their legal counterparts.  NOTE:  This option may
              produce a great deal of output.


       --legalonly
              Output only pixels that are already legal.   Out-
              put black in place of pixels that are not.


       --illegalonly
              Output  only  pixels that are illegal (and output
              them uncorrected).  Output black in place of pix-
              els that are already legal.


       --correctedonly
              Output only pixels that are corrected versions of
              illegal pixels.  Output black in place of  pixels
              that are already legal.
