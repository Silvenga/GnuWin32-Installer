NAME
       Txt2gcal  - creates a verbatim Gcal resource file from a
       text file.

SYNOPSIS
       txt2gcal  [--help  |  --version]  |  [Text-file   |   -]
       [Date-part]

DESCRIPTION
       Txt2gcal  is  a  program  which  creates a verbatim Gcal
       resource file from a text file. If no text-file argument
       is  given  or/but  a  single  `-' character, the program
       reads and processes all input received from the standard
       input  channel.  If  no  date-part  argument  is  given,
       Txt2gcal creates a 0 for the date part. All results  are
       always  shown  on  the  standard output channel. An exit
       status of 0 means all processing is  successfully  done,
       any other value means an error has occured.

OPTIONS
       --help Print  a  usage  message  listing  all  available
              options, then exit successfully.

       --version
              Print the version number, then exit successfully.
