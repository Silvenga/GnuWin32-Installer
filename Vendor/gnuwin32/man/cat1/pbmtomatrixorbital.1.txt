NAME
       pbmtomatrixorbital     -    see    http://netpbm.source-
       forge.net/doc//pbmtomatrixorbital.html

DESCRIPTION
       pbmtomatrixorbital  is  part  of  the  Netpbm   package.
       Netpbm documentation is kept in HTML format.

       Please refer to <http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc//pbm-
       tomatrixorbital.html>.

       If that doesn't work,  also  try  <http://netpbm.source-
       forge.net> and emailing Bryan Henderson, bryanh@giraffe-
       data.com.

       Note that making the documentation  available  this  way
       was  a choice of the person who installed Netpbm on this
       system.  It is also possible to install Netpbm such that
       you  would  simply  see the documentation instead of the
       message you are reading now.
