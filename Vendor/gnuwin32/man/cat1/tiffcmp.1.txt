NAME
       tiffcmp - compare two TIFF files

SYNOPSIS
       tiffcmp [ options ] file1.tif file2.tif

DESCRIPTION
       Tiffcmp  compares the tags and data in two files created
       according to the Tagged Image File Format, Revision 6.0.
       The  schemes  used for compressing data in each file are
       immaterial when data are compared-data are compared on a
       scanline-by-scanline  basis  after  decompression.  Most
       directory tags  are  checked;  notable  exceptions  are:
       GrayResponseCurve,   ColorResponseCurve,   and  ColorMap
       tags.  Data will not be compared if any of the  BitsPer-
       Sample,  SamplesPerPixel,  or  ImageWidth values are not
       equal.  By default, tiffcmp will terminate if it encoun-
       ters any difference.

OPTIONS
       -l     List each byte of image data that differs between
              the files.

       -z number
              List specified number of image  data  bytes  that
              differs between the files.

       -t     Ignore any differences in directory tags.

BUGS
       Tags that are not recognized by the library are not com-
       pared; they may also generate spurious diagnostics.

       The image data of tiled files is not compared, since the
       TIFFReadScanline()  function  is  used.  A error will be
       reported for tiled files.

       The pixel and/or sample number reported  in  differences
       may be off in some exotic cases.
