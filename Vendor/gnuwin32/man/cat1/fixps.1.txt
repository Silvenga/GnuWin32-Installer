NAME
       fixps - sanitize PostScript files

SYNOPSIS
       fixps [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       Try  to  fix common PostScript problems that break post-
       processing.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -v, --version
              display version information and exit

       -q, --quiet
              don't print informational messages

       -o, --output=FILE
              save result in FILE.  If FILE  is  `-',  send  to
              stdout

       -f, --force
              force full rewrite by ghostscript

       -n, --no-fix
              don't fix the FILE, but still honor `-o'

       -c, --check, --dry-run
              don't perform any action

   Fixes:
              - Remove junk before and after PostScript content
              - Use only Unix end of lines (\n) - Remove  empty
              lines  -  Fix  Apple  prologue  (fixmacps)  - Fix
              FrameMaker prologue  (fixfmps)  -  Fix  CorelDraw
              prologue  (fixnt)  -  Fix Windows NT 3.5/4.0 pro-
              logue (fixnt) - Fix Windows 95 prologue -  Ensure
              there  is  a  `%%BeginSetup/%%EndSetup' section -
              Removes Canvas' extraneaous `%%EndDocument:' com-
              ments - Split too long lines

       If the FILE seems really in a bad state, ghostscript may
       be used to perform a full  rewrite.   The  output  might
       then be significantly bigger, but much safer.
