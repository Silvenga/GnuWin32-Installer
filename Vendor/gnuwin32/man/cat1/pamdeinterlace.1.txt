NAME
       pamdeinterlace  -  remove every other row from a PAM/PNM
       image


SYNOPSIS
       pamdeinterlace

       [-takeodd]

       [-takeeven]

       N

       [infile]

       You can use  the  minimum  unique  abbreviation  of  the
       options.   You  can use two hyphens instead of one.  You
       can separate an option name from its  value  with  white
       space instead of an equals sign.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamdeinterlace removes all the even-numbered or odd-num-
       bered rows from the input PNM  or  PAM  image.   Specify
       which with the -takeeven and -takeodd options.

       This  can be useful if the image is a video capture from
       an interlaced video source.   In  that  case,  each  row
       shows  the  subject  1/60 second before or after the two
       rows that surround it.  If the subject is  moving,  this
       can detract from the quality of the image.

       Because  the  resulting  image is half the height of the
       input image, you will then want  to  use  pamstretch  or
       pamscale to restore it to its normal height:

       pamdeinterlace myimage.ppm | pamstretch -yscale=2 >newimage.ppm


OPTIONS
       -takeodd
              Take the odd-numbered rows from the input and put
              them in the output.  The rows are numbered start-
              ing  at  zero,  so the first row in the output is
              the second row from the input.  You cannot  spec-
              ify both -takeeven and -takeodd.


       -takeeven
              Take  the  even-numbered  rows from the input and
              put them in the output.  The  rows  are  numbered
              starting  at zero, so the first row in the output
              is the first row from the  input.   This  is  the
              default.   You  cannot specify both -takeeven and
              -takeodd.
