NAME
       pnmquant  -  quantize  the colors in a Netpbm image to a
       smaller set


SYNOPSIS
       pnmquant  [-center|-meancolor|-meanpixel]   [-floyd|-fs]
       [-nofloyd|-nofs]   [-spreadbrightness|-spreadluminosity]
       ncolors [pnmfile]

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest  unique
       prefix.   You may use two hyphens instead of one to des-
       ignate an option.  You may use  either  white  space  or
       equals signs between an option name and its value.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmquant reads a PNM image as input.  It chooses ncolors
       colors to best represent the image,  maps  the  existing
       colors  to  the new ones, and writes a PNM image as out-
       put.

       This program is simply a combination of pnmcolormap  and
       pnmremap,  where  the  colors  of the input are remapped
       using a color map which is generated from the colors  in
       that  same  input.  The options have the same meaning as
       in those programs.  See their  documentation  to  under-
       stand pnmquant.

       It  is  much  faster  to  call  pnmcolormap and pnmremap
       directly than to run pnmquant.  You save the overhead of
       the  Perl  interpreter and creating two extra processes.
       pnmquant is just a convenience.

       pnmquant did  not  exist  before  Netpbm  9.21  (January
       2001).   Before  that,  ppmquant did the same thing, but
       only on PPM images.  ppmquant continues to exist, but is
       only a front end (for name compatibility) to pnmquant.
