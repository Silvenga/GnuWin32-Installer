RLETOGRAY(1)                                       RLETOGRAY(1)





NAME
       rletogray  -  Splits  an RLE format file into gray scale
       images.

SYNOPSIS
       rletogray [ -o prefix ] [ infile ]


DESCRIPTION
       Rletogray reads a file in RLE(5) format and  splits  the
       file  into  unencoded binary files, one for each channel
       in the RLE file.  The output file  names  will  be  con-
       structed from the input file name or a specified prefix.

       If an input infile is specified, then  the  output  file
       names  will  be  in  the  form "rlefileroot.{alpha, red,
       green, blue}", where  rlefileroot  is  infile  with  any
       ".rle"  suffix stripped off.  If the option -o prefix is
       specified, then the output file names  will  be  of  the
       form  "prefix.{alpha,  red,  green,  blue}".  If neither
       option is given, then the  output  file  names  will  be
       "out.{alpha,  red,  green,  blue}".   Input will be read
       from infile if specified, from  standard  input,  other-
       wise.   If more channels than just red, green, blue, and
       alpha are present in the input, numeric suffixes will be
       used for the others.

OPTIONS
       -o prefix
              Specifies the output file name prefix to be used.

       infile This option is used to name the input  file.   If
              not present, input is taken from stdin.
