NAME
       tiffcp - copy (and possibly convert) a TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       tiffcp [ options ] src1.tif ... srcN.tif dst.tif

DESCRIPTION
       tiffcp  combines  one or more files created according to
       the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0  into  a  single
       TIFF  file.   Because  the output file may be compressed
       using a different algorithm than the input files, tiffcp
       is most often used to convert between different compres-
       sion schemes.

       By default, tiffcp will copy all the understood tags  in
       a  TIFF  directory  of  an  input file to the associated
       directory in the output file.

       tiffcp can be used to reorganize the storage  character-
       istics  of data in a file, but it is explicitly intended
       to not alter or convert the image data  content  in  any
       way.

OPTIONS
       -b image
              subtract  the following monochrome image from all
              others processed.  This can be used to  remove  a
              noise bias from a set of images.  This bias image
              is typically an image of  noise  the  camera  saw
              with its shutter closed.

       -B     Force  output  to be written with Big-Endian byte
              order.  This option only has an effect  when  the
              output  file  is  created  or overwritten and not
              when it is appended to.

       -C     Suppress the use of ``strip chopping'' when read-
              ing  images  that  have  a  single  strip/tile of
              uncompressed data.

       -c     Specify the compression to use for  data  written
              to  the  output  file:  none  for no compression,
              packbits for PackBits compression, lzw  for  Lem-
              pel-Ziv  &  Welch  compression, jpeg for baseline
              JPEG compression, zip for Deflate compression, g3
              for  CCITT  Group 3 (T.4) compression, and g4 for
              CCITT Group  4  (T.6)  compression.   By  default
              tiffcp  will compress data according to the value
              of the Compression tag found in the source  file.

              The  CCITT  Group 3 and Group 4 compression algo-
              rithms can only be used with bilevel data.

              Group 3 compression  can  be  specified  together
              with   several   T.4-specific   options:  1d  for
              1-dimensional  encoding,  2d  for   2-dimensional
              encoding, and fill to force each encoded scanline
              to be zero-filled so  that  the  terminating  EOL
              code  lies  on a byte boundary.  Group 3-specific
              options are specified by appending a  ``:''-sepa-
              rated   list  to  the  ``g3''  option;  e.g.   -c
              g3:2d:fill to  get  2D-encoded  data  with  byte-
              aligned EOL codes.

              LZW  compression can be specified together with a
              predictor value.  A predictor value of  2  causes
              each scanline of the output image to undergo hor-
              izontal differencing  before  it  is  encoded;  a
              value  of  1  forces  each scanline to be encoded
              without differencing.  LZW-specific  options  are
              specified  by appending a ``:''-separated list to
              the ``lzw'' option; e.g.  -c lzw:2 for  LZW  com-
              pression with horizontal differencing.

       -f     Specify the bit fill order to use in writing out-
              put data.  By default, tiffcp will create  a  new
              file  with  the  same fill order as the original.
              Specifying -f lsb2msb will force data to be writ-
              ten  with the FillOrder tag set to LSB2MSB, while
              -f msb2lsb will force data to be written with the
              FillOrder tag set to MSB2LSB.

       -l     Specify the length of a tile (in pixels).  tiffcp
              attempts to set the tile dimensions  so  that  no
              more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile.

       -L     Force  output  to  be  written with Little-Endian
              byte order.  This option only has an effect  when
              the output file is created or overwritten and not
              when it is appended to.

       -M     Suppress the  use  of  memory-mapped  files  when
              reading images.

       -p     Specify  the planar configuration to use in writ-
              ing image data that  has  one  8-bit  sample  per
              pixel.  By default, tiffcp will create a new file
              with the same planar configuration as the  origi-
              nal.   Specifying -p contig will force data to be
              written with multi-sample data  packed  together,
              while  -p separate will force samples to be writ-
              ten in separate planes.

       -r     Specify the number of rows  (scanlines)  in  each
              strip  of  data  written  to the output file.  By
              default (or when value 0  is  specified),  tiffcp
              attempts  to set the rows/strip that no more than
              8 kilobytes of data appear in  a  strip.  If  you
              specify special value -1 it will results in infi-
              nite number of the rows  per  strip.  The  entire
              image will be the one strip in that case.

       -s     Force  the  output  file  to be written with data
              organized in strips (rather than tiles).

       -t     Force the output file to  be  written  with  data
              organized in tiles (rather than strips).  options
              can be used to force the resultant  image  to  be
              written as strips or tiles of data, respectively.

       -w     Specify the width of a tile (in pixels).   tiffcp
              attempts  to  set  the tile dimensions so that no
              more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in  a  tile.
              tiffcp  attempts  to  set  the tile dimensions so
              that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a
              tile.

       -,={character}
              substitute  {character}  for ',' in parsing image
              directory indices in files.  This is necessary if
              filenames  contain  commas.   Note that ',=' with
              whitespace immediately following will disable the
              special  meaning  of the ',' entirely.  See exam-
              ples.

EXAMPLES
       The following concatenates  two  files  and  writes  the
       result using LZW encoding:
              tiffcp -c lzw a.tif b.tif result.tif

       To  convert  a  G3  1d-encoded TIFF to a single strip of
       G4-encoded data the following might be used:
              tiffcp -c g4 -r 10000 g3.tif g4.tif
       (1000 is just a number that is larger than the number of
       rows in the source file.)

       To  extract  a selected set of images from a multi-image
       TIFF file, the file name may be immediately followed  by
       a  ','  separated  list of image directory indices.  The
       first image is always in directory 0.  Thus, to copy the
       1st   and  3rd  images  of  image  file  "album.tif"  to
       "result.tif":
              tiffcp album.tif,0,2 result.tif

       Given file "CCD.tif" whose first image is a  noise  bias
       followed by images which include that bias, subtract the
       noise from all those images following it  (while  decom-
       pressing) with the command:
              tiffcp -c none -b CCD.tif CCD.tif,1, result.tif

       If  the  file  above  were  named "CCD,X.tif", the "-,="
       option would be required to correctly parse  this  file-
       name with image numbers, as follows:
              tiffcp -c none -,=% -b CCD,X.tif CCD,X%1%.tif result.tif
