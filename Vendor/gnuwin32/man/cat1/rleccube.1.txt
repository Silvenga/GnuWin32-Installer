NAME
       rleccube - Make a picture of a color cube.

SYNOPSIS
       rleccube  [ -w squares-wide ] [ -o outfile ] [ cube-side
       ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program computes an RLE(5) image of slices  through
       the  RGB  color cube.  The arguments control the size of
       the cube and the  arrangement  of  the  slices  into  an
       image.  Slices are taken in planes of constant red, with
       green varying along the "x" axis and blue along the  "y"
       axis  within  a slice.  The slice for red=0 is placed in
       the lower left corner of the image; red increases  along
       the bottom row, then to the left of the next row, and so
       on.  The rleswap(1) program can be used to get an  image
       with slices of constant green or blue.

OPTIONS
       -w squares-wide
              The  number  of  slices in a row will be squares-
              wide.  The default is  the  smallest  divisor  of
              cube-side   larger   than   sqrt(cube-side).   If
              squares-wide is not an  exact  divisor  of  cube-
              side,  the  top row will be filled in with slices
              starting from red near 0.

       -o outfile
              If specified, the output will be written to  this
              file.   If outfile is "-", or if it is not speci-
              fied, the output will be written to the  standard
              output stream.

       cube-side
              The  number  of samples on each side of the cube.
              Each slice will be cube-sidexcube-side, and there
              will  be  cube-side slices.  The default value is
              64.

BUGS
       It really should fill in the excess space  in  the  last
       row with black.
