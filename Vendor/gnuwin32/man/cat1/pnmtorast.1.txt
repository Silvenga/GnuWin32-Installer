NAME
       pnmtorast - convert a PPM into a Sun rasterfile


SYNOPSIS
       pnmtorast [-standard|-rle] [pnmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmtorastreads a portable pixmap as input and produces a
       Sun rasterfile as output.

       Color values in Sun rasterfiles are eight bits wide,  so
       pnmtorast will automatically scale colors to have a max-
       val of 255.  An extra pnmdepth step is not necessary.


OPTIONS
       The -standard option forces the result to be in RT_STAN-
       DARD  form;  the  -rle option, RT_BYTE_ENCODED, which is
       smaller but, well, less standard.  The default is  -rle.

       All  options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
       prefix.
