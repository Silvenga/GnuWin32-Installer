RLESWAP(1)                                           RLESWAP(1)





NAME
       rleswap - swap the channels in an RLE file.

SYNOPSIS
       rleswap  [  -v ] [ -f from-channels,...  ] [ -t to-chan-
       nels,...  ] [ -d delete-channels,...  ]  [  -p  channel-
       pairs,...  ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  can  be  used to select or swap the color
       channels in a RLE(5) file.  The  major  options  provide
       four  different ways of specifying a mapping between the
       channels in the input file and the  output  file.   Only
       one  of  the options -f, -t, -d, or -p may be specified.
       If the optional infile is not given, input will be  read
       from  standard input.  A new RLE(5) file will be written
       to the standard output or to outfile, if specified.  The
       output  image  will  be similar to the input, except for
       the specified channel remappings.

OPTIONS
       -v     Print the channel mappings that will be performed
              on the standard error output.

       -f     Following  this  option is a comma separated list
              of numbers indicating the input channel that maps
              to  each  output  channel in sequence.  I.e., the
              first number indicates the input channel  mapping
              to  output  channel 0.  The alpha channel will be
              passed through unchanged if present.   Any  input
              channels  not  mentioned  in  the  list  will not
              appear in the output.

       -t     Following this option is a comma  separated  list
              of numbers indicating the output channel to which
              each input channel, in sequence, will map.  I.e.,
              the  first  number  gives  the  output channel to
              which the first input channel will map.  No  num-
              ber  may  be  repeated  in  this list.  The alpha
              channel  will  be  passed  through  unchanged  if
              present.  Any output channel not mentioned in the
              list will not receive image data.  If  there  are
              fewer  numbers  in  the list than there are input
              channels,  the  excess  input  channels  will  be
              ignored.   If  there  are more numbers than input
              channels, it is an error.

       -d     Following this option is a comma  separated  list
              of numbers indicating channels to be deleted from
              the input  file.   All  other  channels  will  be
              passed  through unchanged.  The alpha channel may
              be specified as -1.

       -p     Following this option is a comma  separated  list
              of  pairs  of channel numbers.  The first channel
              of each pair indicates a  channel  in  the  input
              file  that  will  be mapped to the the channel in
              the output file indicated by the second number in
              the  pair.   No  output channel number may appear
              more than once.  Any input channel not  mentioned
              will  not  appear in the output file.  Any output
              channel not  mentioned  will  not  receive  image
              data.   The alpha channel may be specified as -1.
