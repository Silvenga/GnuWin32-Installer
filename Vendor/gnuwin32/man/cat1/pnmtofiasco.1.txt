NAME
       pnmtofiasco - Convert PNM file to FIASCO compressed file


SYNOPSIS
       pnmtofiasco [option]...  [filename]...


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmtofiasco compresses the named pbm, pgm, or ppm  image
       files,  or  Standard Input if no file is named, and pro-
       duces a FIASCO file on Standard Output.


OPTIONS
       All  option  names  may  be  abbreviated;  for  example,
       --optimize  may  be  written  --optim or --opt. For most
       options a one letter short option is  provided.   Manda-
       tory or optional arguments to long options are mandatory
       or optional for short options, too.  Both short and long
       options are case sensitive.

       The basic options are:



       -i name, --input-name=name
              Compress  the  named  images, not Standard Input.
              If name is -, read Standard Input.  name  has  to
              be  either an image filename or a template of the
              form:

              prefix[start-end{+,-}step]suffix

              Templates  are  useful  when  compressing   video
              streams:   e.g.,  if  you  specify  the  template
              img0[12-01-2].pgm,  then  pnmtofiasco  compresses
              the    images    img012.pgm,   img010.pgm,   ...,
              img002.pgm.

              If name is a relative path, pnmtofiasco  searches
              for  the image files in the current directory and
              in  the  (colon-separated)  list  of  directories
              given  by the environment variable FIASCO_IMAGES.


       -o output-file, --output-name=name
              Write FIASCO output to the  named  file,  not  to
              Standard Output.

              If  name  is  a relative path and the environment
              variable FIASCO_DATA is a (colon-separated)  list
              of  directories, then pnmtofiasco writes the out-
              put file to the  first  (writable)  directory  of
              this list. Otherwise, pnmtofiasco write it to the
              current directory.


       -q N, --quality=N
              Set quality of compression to N.   Quality  is  1
              (worst) to 100 (best); default is 20.


       -v, --version
              Print pnmtofiasco version number, then exit.


       -V N, --verbose N
              Set level of verbosity to N.  Level is 0 (no out-
              put at all), 1 (show progress meter), or 2  (show
              detailed compression statistics); default is 1.


       -B N, --progress-meter N
              Set  type  of progress-meter to N.  The following
              types are available; default is 1:



       0      no progress meter


       1      RPM style progress bar using 50 hash marks


       2      percentage meter




       -f name, --config=name
              Load  parameter  file  name   to  initialize  the
              options of pnmtofiasco.  See file system.fiascorc
              for an example of the syntax. Options of pnmtofi-
              asco  are set by any of the following methods (in
              the specified order):



       o      Global resource file /etc/system.fiascorc

       o      $HOME/.fiascorc

       o      command line

       o      --config=name



       -h, --info
              Print brief help, then exit.


       -H, --help
              Print detailed help, then exit.



       The options for advanced users are:



       -b name, --basis-name=name
              Preload compression basis name into FIASCO.   The
              basis  name provides the initial compression dic-
              tionary.    Either   use   one   of   the   files
              'small.fco',  'medium.fco',  or  'large.fco' that
              come with pnmtofiasco   or  create  a  new  ASCII
              basis file.


       -z N, --optimize=N
              Set   optimization   level  to  N.   Level  is  0
              (fastest) to  3  (slowest);  default  is  1.   Be
              warned,  the encoding time dramatically increased
              when N=2 or N=3 while the compression performance
              only slightly improves.


       -P, --prediction
              Use  additional predictive coding.  If this opti-
              mization is enabled then the image is  compressed
              in  two  steps.   In  the  first  step,  a coarse
              approximation of  the  image  is  computed  using
              large unichrome blocks.  Finally, the delta image
              is computed and the prediction error is  approxi-
              mated using the standard FIASCO algorithm.


       -D N, --dictionary-size=N
              Set  size  of dictionary that is used when coding
              the luminance band to N; default is 10000,  i.e.,
              the dictionary is not restricted.


       -C N, --chroma-dictionary=N
              Set  size  of dictionary that is used when coding
              chroma bands to N; default is 40.


       -Q N, --chroma-qfactor=N
              Reduce the quality of chroma band compression  N-
              times  with respect to the user defined quality q
              of the luminance band compression  (--quality=q);
              default is 2.


       -t N, --tiling-exponent=N
              Subdivide  the image into 2^N tiles prior coding;
              default is 4, i.e. the image is  subdivided  into
              16  tiles. The processing order of the individual
              tiles  is  defined  by   the   option   --tiling-
              method=name.


       -T name, --tiling-method=name
              Order  the  individual  image tiles (the image is
              subdivided into; see option  --tiling-exponent=N)
              by method name; default is desc-variance.



       desc-variance
              Tiles with small variances are processed first.


       asc-variance
              Tiles with large variances are processed first.


       desc-spiral
              Tiles are process in spiral order starting in the
              middle.


       asc-spiral
              Tiles are process in spiral order starting at the
              border.




       --rpf-mantissa=N
              Use N mantissa bits for quantized coefficients.


       --dc-rpf-mantissa=N
              Use  N  mantissa  bits  for  quantized DC coeffi-
              cients.


       --rpf-range=N
              Coefficients outside  the  quantization  interval
              [-N,+N] are set to zero.


       --dc-rpf-range=N
              DC coefficients outside the quantization interval
              [-N,+N] are set to zero.



       Additional options for video compression are



       -s N, --smooth=N
              Smooth decompressed reference  frames  along  the
              partitioning borders by the given amount N.  N is
              0 (no smoothing) to 100;  default  is  70.   This
              factor is stored in the FIASCO file.


       -m N, --min-level=N
              Start  prediction  (motion compensated prediction
              or  additional  prediction)  on  block  level  N;
              default is level 6.  I.e., motion compensation is
              applied to all image blocks of at least 8x8  pix-
              els  (binary  tree  level N=6), 16x8 (N=7), 16x16
              (N=8), etc.


       -M N, --max-level=N
              Stop prediction (motion compensated prediction or
              additional  prediction) on block level N; default
              is  level  10.   I.e.,  motion  compensation   is
              applied to all image blocks of at most 16x16 pix-
              els (N=8), 32x16 (N=9), 32x32 (N=10), etc.


       -2, --half-pixel
              Use half pixel precise motion compensation.


       -F N, --fps=N
              Set number of frames per second to N.  This value
              is  stored  in the FIASCO output file and is used
              in the decoder  fiascotopnm(1)tocontroltheframer-
              ate.


       -p type, --pattern=type
              Defines the type of inter frame compression which
              should be applied to individual frames of a video
              stream.    type  is  a  sequence  of  characters;
              default is 'IPPPPPPPPP'.  Element N  defines  the
              type of predicting which should be used for frame
              N;  the  frame  type  pattern   is   periodically
              extended.  Valid characters are:



       I      intra  frame, i.e., no motion compensated predic-
              tion is used at all.


       P      predicted frame, i.e., a previously encoded frame
              is used for prediction (forward prediction).


       B      bidirectional  predicted  frame, i.e., not only a
              previously shown frame but also a  frame  of  the
              future  is used for prediction (forward, backward
              or interpolated prediction).




       --cross-B-search
              Instead of using exhaustive search the  'Cross-B-
              Search' algorithm is used to find the best inter-
              polated prediction of B-frames.


       --B-as-past-ref
              Also use previously encoded B-frames when predic-
              tion  the  current  frame.  If this option is not
              set, only I- and P-frames are used to predict the
              current frame.





EXAMPLES
       Compress  the  still  image 'foo.ppm' to the FIASCO file
       'foo.wfa' using the default options:

               pnmtofiasco < foo.ppm >foo.wfa

       Compress the video frames 'foo0*.ppm' to the FIASCO file
       'video.wfa' using half pixel precise motion compensation
       at a frame rate of 15 frames per second.  Intra frame  1
       is used to predict P-frame 4, frames 1 and 4 are used to
       predict B-frames 2 and 3, and so on.  Frame 10 is  again
       an intra-frame.
