NAME
       tifftorle - Convert TIFF image files to RLE.

SYNOPSIS
       tifftorle [ -o outfile.rle ] infile.tif


DESCRIPTION
       This program converts a TIFF image to RLE(5) format.

OPTIONS
       -o outfile.rle
              If  specified, the output will be written to this
              file.  If outfile.rle is "-", or  if  it  is  not
              specified,  the  output  will  be  written to the
              standard output stream.

       infile.tif
              The  input  will  be   read   from   this   file.
              infile.tif must be a real file, the special cases
              described in urt(1) do not apply here.

LIMITATIONS
       Can't handle RGB TIFF files with a separate planar  con-
       figuration.
       Can't handle tiled TIFF files.
