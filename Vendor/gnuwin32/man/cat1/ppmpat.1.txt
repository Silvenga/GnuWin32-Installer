NAME
       ppmpat - make a pretty PPM image


SYNOPSIS
       ppmpat  {-gingham2|-g2}  |  {-gingham3|-g3}  | -madras |
       -tartan | -poles | -squig  |  -camo  |  -anticamo  width
       height

       You  can  abbreviate  any  option to its shortest unique
       prefix.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmpat produces a PPM of the specified width and height,
       with a pattern in it.

       This program is mainly to demonstrate use of the ppmdraw
       routines, a simple but powerful  drawing  library.   See
       the  ppmdraw.h include file for more info on using these
       routines.  Still, some of the  patterns  can  be  rather
       pretty.  If you have a color workstation, something like
       ppmpat -squig 300 300 | pnmquant 128 should  generate  a
       nice background.

       Some  of these patterns have large numbers of colors, so
       if you want a simpler pattern, use pnmquant on the  out-
       put.


OPTIONS
       The options specify various pattern types:



       -gingham2
              A gingham check pattern.  Can be tiled.


       -gingham3
              A  slightly  more  complicated  gingham.   Can be
              tiled.


       -madras
              A madras plaid.  Can be tiled.


       -tartan
              A tartan plaid.  Can be tiled.


       -poles Color  gradients  centered   on   randomly-placed
              poles.


       -squig Squiggley tubular pattern.  Can be tiled.


       -camo  Camouflage pattern.


       -anticamo
              Anti-camouflage  pattern - like -camo, but ultra-
