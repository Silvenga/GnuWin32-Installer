NAME
       anytopnm  -  convert  an arbitrary type of image file to
       PBM, PGM, or PPM


SYNOPSIS
       anytopnm [file]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       anytopnm converts the input image, which may be  in  any
       of  dozens of graphics formats, to PBM, PGM, or PPM for-
       mat, depending on that nature of the  input  image,  and
       outputs it to Standard Output.

       To  determine the format of the input, anytopnm uses the
       file program (possibly assisted  by  the  magic  numbers
       file fragment included with Netpbm). If that fails (very
       few image formats have magic numbers), anytopnm looks at
       the  filename extension.  If that fails, anytopnm punts.

       The type of the output file depends on the input  image.

       If  file  indicates  that  the  input file is compressed
       (either via Unix compress, gzip, or  bzip  compression),
       anytopnm  uncompresses it and proceeds as above with the
       uncompressed result.

       If file indicates that the  input  file  is  encoded  by
       uuencode  or  btoa,  anytopnm decodes it and proceeds as
       above with the decoded result.

       If file is - or not given, anytopnm takes its input from
       Standard Input.
