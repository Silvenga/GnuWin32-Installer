NAME
       pnmsplit  -  split  a multi-image PNM file into multiple
       single-image files


SYNOPSIS
       pnmsplit

       [pnmfile[ output_file_pattern]]

       [-padname=n]

       Minimum unique abbreviation  of  option  is  acceptable.
       You  may  use double hyphens instead of single hyphen to
       denote options.  You may use white space in place of the
       equals sign to separate an option name from its value.



DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmsplit  reads  a  PNM stream as input.  It copies each
       image in the input into a separate  file,  in  the  same
       format.

       pnmfile  is the file specification of the input file, or
       - to indicate Standard Input.  The default  is  Standard
       Input.

       output_file_pattern  tells how to name the output files.
       It is the file specification of the output file,  except
       that  the  first  occurence of '%d' in it is replaced by
       the image sequence number  in  unpadded  ASCII  decimal,
       with the sequence starting at 0.  If there is no '%d' in
       the pattern, pnmsplit fails.

       The default output file pattern is 'image%d'.

       The -padname option specifies to how many characters you
       want  the  image sequence number in the output file name
       padded with zeroes.  pnmpslit adds leading zeroes to the
       image  sequence number to get up to at least that number
       of characters.  This is just the number of characters in
       the sequence number part of the name.  For example, pnm-
       split - outputfile%d.ppm -padname=3 would  yield  output
       filenames outputfile000.ppm, outputfile001.ppm, etc.

       The default is no padding (equivalent to -padname=0.

       The -padname option was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).
       Before that, there was never any padding.

       Note that to do the reverse operation (combining  multi-
       ple  single-image  PNM  files  into  a multi-image one),
       there is no special Netpbm program.  Just use cat.
