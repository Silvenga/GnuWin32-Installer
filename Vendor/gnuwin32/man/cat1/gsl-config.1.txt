NAME
       gsl-config  -  script to get version number and compiler
       flags of the installed GSL library

SYNOPSIS
       gsl-config     [--prefix]      [--version]      [--libs]
       [--libs-without-cblas] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       gsl-config is a tool that is used to configure to deter-
       mine the compiler and linker flags that should  be  used
       to  compile  and  link programs that use GSL. It is also
       used internally to the .m4 macros for GNU autoconf  that
       are included with GSL.

       --version
               Print  the currently installed version of GSL on
               the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags  that  are  necessary  to
               link a GSL program, with cblas

       --libs-without-cblas
               Print  the  linker  flags  that are necessary to
               link a GSL program, without cblas

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are  necessary  to
               compile a GSL program.
