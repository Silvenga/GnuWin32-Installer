NAME
       lid - Query ID database and report results

SYNOPSIS
       lid [OPTION]... PATTERN...

DESCRIPTION
       Query  ID database and report results.  By default, out-
       put consists of multiple lines, each line containing the
       matched identifier followed by the list of file names in
       which it occurs.

       -f, --file=FILE
              file name of ID database

       -i, --ignore-case
              match PATTERN case insensitively

       -l, --literal
              match PATTERN as a literal string

       -r, --regexp
              match PATTERN as a regular expression

       -w, --word
              match PATTERN as a delimited word

       -s, --substring
              match PATTERN as a substring

              Note:  If  PATTERN  contains   extended   regular
              expression metacharacters, it is interpreted as a
              regular expression substring.  Otherwise, PATTERN
              is interpreted as a literal word.

       -k, --key=STYLE
              STYLE is one of `token', `pattern' or `none'

       -R, --result=STYLE
              STYLE  is  one  of `filenames', `grep', `edit' or
              `none'

       -S, --separator=STYLE STYLE is one of `braces',  `space'
       or `newline' and
              only applies to file names  when  `--result=file-
              names'

              The above STYLE options control how query results
              are   presented.    Defaults   are    --key=token
              --result=filenames --separator=space

       -F, --frequency=FREQ
              find  tokens that occur FREQ times, where FREQ is
              a range expressed as `N..M'.  If N is omitted, it
              defaults  to  1,  if  M is omitted it defaults to
              MAX_USHRT

       -a, --ambiguous=LEN
              find tokens whose names  are  ambiguous  for  LEN
              chars

       -x, --hex
              only find numbers expressed as hexadecimal

       -d, --decimal
              only find numbers expressed as decimal

       -o, --octal
              only find numbers expressed as octal

              By  default, searches match numbers of any radix.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit
