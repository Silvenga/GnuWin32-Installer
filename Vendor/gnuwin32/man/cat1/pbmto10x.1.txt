NAME
       pbmto10x  -  convert a PBM image into Gemini 10X printer
       graphics


SYNOPSIS
       pbmto10x [-h] [pbmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmto10x reads a PBM image as input and produces a  file
       of  Gemini  10X  printer  graphics as output.  The 10x's
       printer codes are alleged to be  similar  to  the  Epson
       codes.

       Note  that  there is no 10xtopbm tool - this transforma-
       tion is one way.


OPTIONS
       The resolution is normally 60H by 72V.  If  you  specify
       the -h option, resolution is 120H by 144V.  You may find
       it useful to rotate landscape images before printing.
