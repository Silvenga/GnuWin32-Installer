NAME
       pbmtoimgv - Portable Bitmap to Pilot Image Viewer convert-
       er, version 2.0.

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtoimgv [-h] [-v] [-t title]  [-n  notefile]  [-{c|m|u}]
       [in [out]]

DESCRIPTION
       pbmtoimgv  is  a  simple  filter  for  converting Portable
       Bitmap to monochrome Pilot Image Viewer pdb files.

       If an image's width is not a multiple of 16 pixels, enough
       extra  white pixels will be added at the right side to en-
       sure alignment.  Images will be padded, with white pixels,
       to a width and height of 160 if needed.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display a short summary of the command line options
              and exit.

       -v     Display the version and exit.

       -t title
              Specify the title of the image (up  to  31  charac-
              ters).

       -n notefile
              Specify  the note file.  No note is attached to the
              image by default.

       -m     Produce a compressed image if it  is  smaller  than
              the uncompressed version.  This is the default com-
              pression mode.
