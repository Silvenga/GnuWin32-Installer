NAME
       rletops - Convert RLE images to PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       rletops [ -C ] [ -a aspect ] [ -c center ] [ -h height ]
       [ -o outfile.ps ] [ -s ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rletops converts RLE(5)  images  into  PostScript.   The
       conversion uses the PostScript image operator, instruct-
       ing the device to reproduce the image to the best of its
       abilities.   If infile isn't specified, the RLE image is
       read from stdin.  The PostScript  output  is  dumped  to
       stdout, or to outfile.ps, if specified.

OPTIONS
       -a aspect
              Specify  aspect  ratio  of image.  Default is 1.0
              (note PostScript uses square pixels).

       -C     Causes a color PostScript image to be  generated.
              This creates larger files and uses the PostScript
              colorimage operator, which is not  recognized  by
              all devices.  The default is monochrome.

       -c center
              Centers  the  images  about a point center inches
              from the left edge of the page (or left margin if
              -s is specified).  Default is 4.25 inches.

       -h height
              Specifies  the height (in inches) the image is to
              appear on the page.  The default is three inches.
              The  width  of  the  image is calculated from the
              image height, aspect ratio, and pixel dimensions.

       -s     Specifies  image  is  to  be generated in "Scribe
              Mode."  The image is generated  without  a  Post-
              Script  showpage  operator  at  the  end, and the
              default image center is changed  to  3.25  inches
              from  the margin (which usually is 1 inch).  This
              is to  generate  PostScript  files  that  can  be
              included  in  Scribe  documents with the @Picture
              command.  Images may also be  included  in  LaTex
              documents  with  local conventions like the \spe-
              cial{psfile=image.ps} command.

NOTES
       On devices like the Apple LaserWriter, rletops generates
       large PostScript files that take a non-trivial amount of
       time to download and print.  A 512x512 image takes about
       ten  minutes.   For including images in documents at the
       default sizes, 256x256 is usually sufficient resolution.

BUGS
       Due   to   a   mis-understanding   with  the  PostScript
       interpreter, rletops always rounds the image size up  to
       an even number of scanlines.
