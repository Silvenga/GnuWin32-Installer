NAME
       gri - scientific graphics language

SYNOPSIS
       gri [ OPTIONS ] [ CommandFile [ optional_arguments ]]


DESCRIPTION
       Gri  is  a programming language for scientific graphics.
       It  can  make  x-y  graphs,  contour-graphs,  and  image
       graphs.   In addition, Gri has a full suite of low-level
       graphical elements and sufficient programming  capabili-
       ties  (loops,  subroutines,  etc) to permit complex cus-
       tomization.

       Gri is not a point-click application.  In some  ways  it
       is  analogous to TeX.  Extensive power rewards tolerance
       of a modest learning curve.

       For more information, please  consult  online  info  and
       html manuals.

       The info manual is normally accessed by typing

       info gri

       The    html   manual   is   located   at   /usr/doc/gri-
       N.N.N/html/index.html, where N.N.N is the  version  num-
       ber.

       The    html    FAQ    is    located   at   /usr/doc/gri-
       N.N.N/html/FAQ.html



GRI_MERGE AND GRI_UNPAGE COMMANDS
       Two Perl scripts are provided with Gri to manipulate the
       PostScript output.

       gri_merge  is  used  to  merge multiple Gri output files
       into a single PostScript file.  Type  gri_merge  -h  for
       usage information.

       gri_unpage is used is split a multi-page Gri output file
       (in which the new page command was used)  into  separate
       PostScript files, one for each page.  Type gri_unpage -h



EMACS SUPPORT
       An emacs mode is provided with Gri.

       The mode is installed automatically  in  Debian  by  the
       elisp file:

       /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50gri.el

       The emacs mode itself is gri-mode.el and is installed on
       Debian as /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/gri-mode.el

       Byte-compiled versions of this  file  are  produced  for
       every  flavour  of  Emacs  that  is  installed,  and are
       located  in  places   like   /usr/share/emacs/20.2/site-
       lisp/gri-mode.elc
