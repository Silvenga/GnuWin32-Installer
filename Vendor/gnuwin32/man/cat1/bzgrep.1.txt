NAME
       bzgrep,  bzfgrep,  bzegrep  - search possibly bzip2 com-
       pressed files for a regular expression

SYNOPSIS
       bzgrep [ grep_options ] [ -e ] pattern filename...
       bzegrep [ egrep_options ] [ -e ] pattern filename...
       bzfgrep [ fgrep_options ] [ -e ] pattern filename...

DESCRIPTION
       Bzgrep is used to invoke the  grep  on  bzip2-compressed
       files.  All  options  specified  are  passed directly to
       grep.  If no file is specified, then the standard  input
       is decompressed if necessary and fed to grep.  Otherwise
       the given files are uncompressed if necessary and fed to
       grep.

       If bzgrep is invoked as bzegrep or bzfgrep then egrep or
       fgrep is used instead of grep.  If the GREP  environment
       variable  is  set, bzgrep uses it as the grep program to
       be invoked. For example:

           for sh:  GREP=fgrep  bzgrep string files
           for csh: (setenv GREP fgrep; bzgrep string files)
