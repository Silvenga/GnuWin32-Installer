NAME
       rledither - Floyd Steinberg dither an image to the given
       colors.

SYNOPSIS
       rledither [ -e edge_factor ] [ -l nchan length  ]  -{tf}
       mapfile [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  accepts an RLE(5) file and a file of col-
       ormap entries, and dithers the image  to  those  colors.
       Edge enhancement is also performed, if specified.

OPTIONS
       -e edge_factor
              An  edge_factor of zero means no edge enhancement
              (the default).  A value of 1.0 looks pretty  good
              for most images.

       -l nchan length
              Specifies the number of channels in the colormap,
              and the number of entries in each  channel.   The
              default  is  3  channels of 256 entries, which is
              appropriate for an eight bit color display.

       -{tf} mapfile
              The mapfile must contain  at  least  nchan*length
              values in the range 0 to 255.  The -t flag causes
              mapfile to be read as R G B R G B R G  B...   The
              -f  flag  implies  the  entries are listed as R R
              R... G G G... B B B...

       -o outfile
              If specified, the output will be written to  this
              file.   If outfile is "-", or if it is not speci-
              fied, the output will be written to the  standard
              output stream.

       infile The input will be read from this file.  If infile
              is "-" or is not specified,  the  input  will  be
              read from the standard input stream.

BUGS
       It  should  read colormaps from RLE files, too.  For the
       moment, edit the output from rlehdr -m.
