WASATCHRLE(1)                                     WASATCHRLE(1)





NAME
       wasatchrle  - Convert Wasatch Systems image files to RLE
       format

SYNOPSIS
       wasatchrle [ -o outfile ] basename

DESCRIPTION
       Wasatchrle converts image files generated by the Wasatch
       Systems Paint program to RLE format.  It expects to find
       two files, "basename.lut" (the color look-up table)  and
       "basename.rlc" (the run-length encoded data).

       Wasatchrle  generates  as  output  a  single channel RLE
       image with a full color map.  Since  the  Wasatch  Paint
       program's  origin  is  the  top  left  of the image, the
       results should be passed through rleflip -v to correctly
       orient the image.  If the image is to be used with other
       toolkit operations (e.g., compositing), it should  first
       be  run  through  applymap(1)  to convert the image to a
       full color (three channel) RLE file.
