NAME
       ppmtosixel - convert a PPM image to DEC sixel format


SYNOPSIS
       ppmtosixel

       [-raw]

       [-margin]

       [ppmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmtosixel reads a PPM image as input and produces sixel
       commands (SIX) as output.  The output is  formatted  for
       color  printing,  e.g.  for  a  DEC  LJ250  color inkjet
       printer.

       If RGB values from the PPM file do not have  maxval=100,
       ppmtosixel  rescales them to maxval 100.  A printer con-
       trol header and a color assignment table begin  the  SIX
       file.   Image data is in a compressed format by default.
       A printer control footer ends the image file.


OPTIONS
       -raw   If you specify this, each pixel will  be  explic-
              itly described in the image file.  If -raw is not
              specified, output will default to compressed for-
              mat   in  which  identical  adjacent  pixels  are
              replaced by 'repeat pixel' commands.  A raw  file
              is often an order of magnitude larger than a com-
              pressed file and prints much slower.


       -margin
              If you don't  specify  -margin,  the  image  will
              start  at  the left margin (of the window, paper,
              or whatever).  If you do specify -margin,  a  1.5
              inch left margin will offset the image.




PRINTING
       Generally,  sixel  files  must  reach the printer unfil-
       tered.   Use  the  lpr  -x  option  or  cat  filename  >
       /dev/tty0?.


LIMITATIONS
       Upon rescaling, truncation of the least significant bits
       of RGB values may result in poor color  conversion.   If
       the  original PPM maxval was greater than 100, rescaling
       also reduces the image depth.  While the actual RGB val-
       ues  from  the  ppm  file are more or less retained, the
       color palette of the LJ250 may not match the  colors  on
       your screen.  This seems to be a printer limitation.
