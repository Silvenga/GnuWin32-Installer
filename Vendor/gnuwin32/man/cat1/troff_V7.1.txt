TROFF(1)                                               TROFF(1)




NAME
       troff, nroff - text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS
       troff [ option ] ...  [ file ] ...

       nroff [ option ] ...  [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Troff  formats text in the named files for printing on a
       Graphic Systems C/A/T phototypesetter; nroff  for  type-
       writer-like  devices.   Their capabilities are described
       in the Nroff/Troff user's manual.

       If no file argument is present, the  standard  input  is
       read.   An  argument consisting of a single minus (-) is
       taken to be a file name corresponding  to  the  standard
       input.   The  options,  which may appear in any order so
       long as they appear before the files, are:

       -olist Print only pages whose page numbers appear in the
              comma-separated  list  of  numbers and ranges.  A
              range N-M means pages N through M; an initial  -N
              means  from  the beginning to page N; and a final
              N- means from N to the end.

       -nN    Number first generated page N.

       -sN    Stop every N pages.  Nroff  will  halt  prior  to
              every  N pages (default N=1) to allow paper load-
              ing or changing, and will resume upon receipt  of
              a  newline.   Troff will stop the phototypesetter
              every N pages, produce a trailer to allow  chang-
              ing  cassettes,  and resume when the typesetter's
              start button is pressed.

       -mname Prepend the macro file /usr/lib/tmac/tmac.name to
              the input files.

       -raN   Set register a (one-character) to N.

       -i     Read  standard  input  after  the input files are
              exhausted.

       -q     Invoke the simultaneous input-output mode of  the
              rd request.

       Nroff only

       -Tname Prepare  output  for  specified  terminal.  Known
              names are 37 for the (default) Teletype  Corpora-
              tion  Model  37  terminal,  tn300 for the GE Ter-
              miNet 300  (or  any  terminal  without  half-line
              capability),  300S for the DASI-300S, 300 for the
              DASI-300,  and  450  for  the  DASI-450   (Diablo
              Hyterm).

       -e     Produce  equally-spaced  words in adjusted lines,
              using full terminal resolution.

       -h     Use output  tabs  during  horizontal  spacing  to
              speed  output  and reduce output character count.
              Tab settings are assumed to be  every  8  nominal
              character widths.

       Troff only

       -t     Direct  output  to the standard output instead of
              the phototypesetter.

       -f     Refrain from feeding out paper and stopping  pho-
              totypesetter at the end of the run.

       -w     Wait  until phototypesetter is available, if cur-
              rently busy.

       -b     Report whether the  phototypesetter  is  busy  or
              available.  No text processing is done.

       -a     Send  a  printable  ASCII  approximation  of  the
              results to the standard output.

       -pN    Print  all  characters  in  point  size  N  while
              retaining all prescribed spacings and motions, to
              reduce phototypesetter elasped time.

       -g     Prepare output for  a  GCOS  phototypesetter  and
              direct it to the standard output (see gcat(1)).

       If  the  file  /usr/adm/tracct  is writable, troff keeps
       phototypesetter accounting records there.  The integrity
       of that file may be secured by making troff a `set user-
       id' program.
