GCAL(1)                                                 GCAL(1)





NAME
       Gcal - a program for calculating and printing calendars.

SYNOPSIS
       gcal [[Option...] [%Date] [@File...]] [Command]

DESCRIPTION
       Gcal is a program similar the standard calendar programs
       BSD-`cal' and `calendar'.

       Gcal  displays hybrid and proleptic Julian and Gregorian
       calendar sheets,  respectively,  for  one  month,  three
       months  or a whole year.  It also displays eternal holi-
       day lists for many countries around the globe, and  fea-
       tures  a very powerful creation of fixed date lists that
       can be used for reminding purposes.  Gcal can  calculate
       various  astronomical  data and times of the Sun and the
       Moon for at pleasure any location, precisely enough  for
       most  civil purposes.  Gcal supports some other calendar
       systems, for example the Chinese and Japanese  calendar,
       the Hebrew calendar and the civil Islamic calendar, too.

       If Gcal is started without any options  or  commands,  a
       calendar of the current month is displayed.

       If  the  calendar of a definite year is wanted, the year
       must be fully specified,

            e.g.:  gcal 94

       displays a year calendar of the year 94, not of the year
       1994.

       If  two  arguments  are  given  in the command part, the
       first argument denotes the month and the second argument
       denotes the year. In case any illegal commands are given
       running Gcal , the program will use internal defaults.
