NAME
       psmerge  - filter to merge several PostScript files into
       one

SYNOPSIS
       psmerge [ -oout.ps ] [ file.ps ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Psmerge merges PostScript documents into a single  docu-
       ment.  It  only works in the specific case the the files
       were created using the same application, with  the  same
       device  setup  and resources (fonts, procsets, patterns,
       files, etc) loaded.

       If the -o option is used, output will  be  sent  to  the
       file named, otherwise it will go to standard output.

       Psmerge  will  merge  multiple files concatenated into a
       single file as if they were in separate files.

BUGS
       psmerge is for a very specific case; it does  not  merge
       files in the general case.
       For  all those cases which can not be handled by psmerge
       the program gs (known as ghostscript) may help:


             gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pswrite -sOutputFile=out.ps \
             file1.ps file2.ps ... -c quit


       This is rather slow and generates bigger output files.
