NAME
       pcxtoppm - convert a PCX file into a PPM image


SYNOPSIS
       pcxtoppm [-stdpalette] [-verbose] [pcxfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pcxtoppm  reads  a  PCX file as input and produces a PPM
       image as output.

       pcxtoppm recognizes the following PCX types:



       o      Colormapped files with 2-16 colors.

              'Packed pixel' format (1, 2 or  4  bits/pixel,  1
              plane)  or  bitplane  format  (1  bit/pixel,  1-4
              planes).  The program uses a predefined  standard
              palette if the image does not provide one.  'Does
              not provide one' means the  palette  in  the  PCX
              header is completely black.


       o      Colormapped files with 256 colors.

              8 bits/pixel, 1 plane, colormap at the end of the
              file.


       o      24bit truecolor files.

              24bit RGB: 8 bits/pixel, 3 planes.


       o      32bit truecolor files.

              24bit RGB  +  8bit  intensity:  8  bits/pixel,  4
              planes.




OPTIONS
       -stdpalette
              This option causes pcxtoppm to use its predefined
              standard palette even if the PCX  image  provides
              its own.  This is meaningful only for an image in
              the 16 color paletted PCX format.

              The image may appear to provide its  own  palette
              but in fact be created by a program too primitive
              to understand  palettes  that  created  a  random
              palette by accident.
