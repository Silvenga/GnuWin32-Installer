NAME
       Tcal - runs the Gcal program with the date of tomorrow's
       day.

SYNOPSIS
       tcal [--help | --version] | [--shift=[+|-]number] [Argu-
       ment...]

DESCRIPTION
       Tcal  is  a  program which runs gcal with a date set one
       day ahead (equivalent the --shift=1 option).  All  given
       arguments  are passed unmodified to the Gcal program. If
       the Gcal program shall be called with another date  than
       tomorrow's  date,  this  desired date can be selected by
       using the --shift=[+|-]number option, in which [+|-]num-
       ber  is the distance of days the desired date is distant
       from the actual date (works only for  Gregorian  years).
       The  --shift option must be given before all other argu-
       ments which are passed to the Gcal program. An exit sta-
       tus  of 0 means all processing is successfully done, any
       other value means an error has occured.

OPTIONS
       --help Print  a  usage  message  listing  all  available
              options, then exit successfully.

       --version
              Print the version number, then exit successfully.

       --shift=[+|-]number
              Define the displacement in [+|-]number  days  the
              desired date is distant from the actual date.

ENVIRONMENT
       GCALPROG
              The  GCALPROG  environment  variable contains the
              file name of the executable Gcal  program,  which
              is  used  by Tcal to call Gcal. This takes prece-
              dence  over  the  file  name  `gcal',  which   is
              burned-in during the compilation step of tcal.
