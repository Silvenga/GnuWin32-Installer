DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       This program is obsolete since Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).
       Use pamditherbw(1)todowhatthisprogram used to do.

       pgmtopbm  never  was the simple converter it appeared to
       be.  It was  a  dithering  program.   Unfortunately,  it
       didn't  do the dithering properly because it treated the
       PGM input samples as if they were directly  proportional
       to   light  intensity,  but  they  are  actually  gamma-
       adjusted.

       pamditherbw is backward compatible with pgmtopbm  except
       that it does the correct gamma adjustments.
