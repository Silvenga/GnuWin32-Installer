NAME
       asciitopgm - convert ASCII graphics into a PGM


SYNOPSIS
       asciitopgm [-d divisor] height width [asciifile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       asciitopgm  reads ASCII data as input and produces a PGM
       image with pixel values which are  an  approximation  of
       the  'brightness'  of  the  ASCII  characters,  assuming
       black-on-white printing.  In other words, a capital M is
       very dark, a period is very light, and a space is white.

       Obviously, asciitopgm assumes a certain font in  assign-
       ing a brightness value to a character.

       asciitopgm  considers ASCII control characters to be all
       white.  It assigns special brightnesses  to  lower  case
       letters  which  have  nothing  to do with what they look
       like printed.  asciitopgm takes the ASCII character code
       from  the lower 7 bits of each input byte.  But it warns
       you if the most signficant bit of any input byte is  not
       zero.

       Input  lines  which  are fewer than width characters are
       automatically padded with spaces.

       The divisor value is an integer (decimal) by  which  the
       blackness  of an input character is divided; the default
       value is 1.  You can use this to adjust  the  brightness
       of  the output: for example, if the image is too bright,
       increase the divisor.

       In keeping with (I believe) Fortran line-printer conven-
       tions,  input  lines beginning with a + (plus) character
       are assumed to 'overstrike' the previous line,  allowing
       a larger range of gray values.

       If you're looking for something that creates an image of
       text, with that text specified in ASCII, that  is  some-
       thing quite different.  Use pbmtext for that.
