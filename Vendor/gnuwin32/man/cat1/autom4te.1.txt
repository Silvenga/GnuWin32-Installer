NAME
       autom4te - Generate files and scripts thanks to M4

SYNOPSIS
       autom4te [OPTION]... [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       Run  GNU M4 on the FILES, avoiding useless runs.  Output
       the traces if tracing, the frozen file if freezing, oth-
       erwise the expansion of the FILES.

       If  some of the FILES are named `FILE.m4f' they are con-
       sidered to be M4 frozen files of all the previous  files
       (which  are therefore not loaded).  If `FILE.m4f' is not
       found, then `FILE.m4' will be used,  together  with  all
       the previous files.

       Some files may be optional, i.e., will only be processed
       if found in the include  path,  but  then  must  end  in
       `.m4?';   the  question  mark  is not part of the actual
       file name.

   FORMAT defaults to `$f:$l:$n:$%', and can use the  following
       escapes:
       $$     literal $

       $f     file where macro was called

       $l     line where macro was called

       $d     nesting depth of macro call

       $n     name of the macro

       $NUM   argument NUM, unquoted and with newlines

       $SEP@  all  arguments,  with newlines, quoted, and sepa-
              rated by SEP

       $SEP*  all arguments, with newlines, unquoted, and sepa-
              rated by SEP

       $SEP%  all  arguments,  without  newlines, unquoted, and
              separated by SEP
