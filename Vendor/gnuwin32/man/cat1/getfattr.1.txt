GETFATTR(1)              File Utilities             GETFATTR(1)





NAME
       getfattr - get extended attributes of filesystem objects

SYNOPSIS
       getfattr [-hRLP] -n name [-e en] pathname...
       getfattr [-hRLP] -d [-e en] [-m pattern] pathname...

DESCRIPTION
       For each file, getfattr displays the file name, and  the
       set  of extended attribute names (and optionally values)
       which are associated with that file.

       The output format of getfattr -d is as follows:
               1:  # file: somedir/
               2:  user.name0="value0"
               3:  user.name1="value1"
               4:  user.name2="value2"
               5:  ...

       Line 1 identifies the file name for which the  following
       lines  are being reported.  The remaining lines (lines 2
       to 4 above) show the name  and  value  pairs  associated
       with the specified file.

   OPTIONS
       -n name, --name=name
           Dump  the  value  of  the  named  extended attribute
           extended attribute.

       -d, --dump
           Dump the values of all extended  attributes  associ-
           ated with pathname.

       -e en, --encoding=en
           Encode  values  after retrieving them.  Valid values
           of en  are  "text",  "hex",  and  "base64".   Values
           encoded  as  text  strings  are  enclosed  in double
           quotes ("), while strings encoded as hexidecimal and
           base64 are prefixed with 0x and 0s, respectively.

       -h, --no-dereference
           Do  not  follow symlinks.  If pathname is a symbolic
           link, the symbolic link itself is  examined,  rather
           than the file the link refers to.

       -m pattern, --match=pattern
           Only include attributes with names matching the reg-
           ular expression pattern.  The default value for pat-
           tern  is  "^user\\.",  -m  which  includes  all  the
           attributes in the user namespace.  Refer to  attr(5)
           for a more detailed discussion on namespaces.

       --absolute-names
           Do  not  strip  leading slash characters ('/').  The
           default behaviour is to strip leading slash  charac-
           ters.

       --only-values
           Dump out the extended attribute value(s) only.

       -R, --recursive
           List  the  attributes  of  all files and directories
           recursively.

       -L, --logical
           Logical walk, follow symbolic  links.   The  default
           behaviour  is to follow symbolic link arguments, and
           to skip symbolic links  encountered  in  subdirecto-
           ries.

       -P, --physical
           Physical  walk,  skip all symbolic links.  This also
           skips symbolic link arguments.

       --version
           Print the version of getfattr and exit.

       --help
           Print help explaining the command line options.

       --  End of command line options.  All remaining  parame-
           ters  are  interpreted  as  file names, even if they
           start with a dash character.
