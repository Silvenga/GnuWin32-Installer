NAME
       ppmtv  - make a PPM image look like taken from an Ameri-
       can TV


SYNOPSIS
       ppmtv dimfactor

       [ppmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmtv reads a PPM image as input and  dims  every  other
       row  of  image  data  down  by the specified dim factor.
       This factor may be in the range of  0.0  (the  alternate
       lines are totally black) to 1.0 (original image).

       This creates an effect similar to what I've once seen in
       the video clip 'You could be mine' by Guns'n'Roses.   In
       the  scene  I'm talking about you can see John Connor on
       his motorbike, looking up  from  the  water  trench  (?)
       he's  standing  in.   While  the  camera pulls back, the
       image gets 'normal' by brightening up the alternate rows
       of  it. I thought this would be an interesting effect to
       try in MPEG. I did not yet check this out, however.  Try
       for yourself.
