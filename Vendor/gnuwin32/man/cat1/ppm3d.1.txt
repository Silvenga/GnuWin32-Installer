NAME
       ppm3d  -  convert  two  PPM  images  into  a red/blue 3d
       glasses PPM


SYNOPSIS
       ppm3d leftppmfile rightppmfile [horizontal_offset]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppm3d reads two PPM images as input and produces  a  PPM
       as  output,  with  the  images  overlapping  by horizon-
       tal_offset pixels in blue/red format.  The idea is  that
       if  you look at the image with 3-D glasses (glasses that
       admit only red through one eye and  only  green  through
       the other), you see an image with depth.  This is called
       a stereogram.

       horizontal_offset defaults to 30 pixels.  The input PPMs
       must be the same dimensions.

       To  make  a  different kind of stereogram, use pamstere-
       ogram.  That makes a steregram  that  you  view  without
       special  glasses,  just  by letting your eyes unfocus so
       that each eye sees different parts of the image.
