NAME
       rletotiff - Convert 24 bit RLE image files to TIFF.

SYNOPSIS
       rletotiff [ -{cC} ] -o outfile.tif [ -v ] [ infile.rle ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program converts a 24 bit image  in  RLE(5)  format
       into  TIFF form.  Only a single image will be converted.

OPTIONS
       -{cC}  Sets the type of compression used in  the  output
              file.   -c  (the  default)  will cause the output
              file to be compressed using the  Lempel-Ziv-Welch
              (LZW)  algorithm.   -C will suppress any compres-
              sion.

       -o outfile.tif
              The output will be written to  this  file.   out-
              file.tif  must  be a real file, the special cases
              described in urt (1) do  not  apply.   Note  also
              that  this "option" is not optional.  The -o flag
              is required for consistency with the other tools.

       -v     Flip image vertically.

       infile.rle
              The  input  will  be  read  from  this  file.  If
              infile.rle is "-" or is not specified, the  input
              will be read from the standard input stream.
