GRAYTORLE(1)                                       GRAYTORLE(1)





NAME
       graytorle  - Merges gray scale images into an RLE format
       file.

SYNOPSIS
       graytorle [ -a ] [ -h hdrsize ] [  -o  outfile  ]  xsize
       ysize infiles

DESCRIPTION
       Graytorle  reads  a  list  of 8-bit gray scale images in
       unencoded binary format and converts them to  an  RLE(5)
       image  with  the number of channels corresponding to the
       number of input files.  A  command  line  option  allows
       specifying one of the files as an alpha channel.

OPTIONS
       -a     Designates  the  first  file in the input list as
              being information for the alpha  channel  of  the
              image.

       -h hdrsize
              Often gray scale image files include some sort of
              header information.  This option allows  specifi-
              cation  of  a  count  of  bytes to discard at the
              beginning of each input file.

       xsize  Specifies the horizontal resolution of the  input
              files.

       ysize  Specifies  the  vertical  resolution of the input
              files.

       -o outfile
              This option is used  to  name  the  output  file.
              Otherwise, output is written to stdout.

       infiles
              List of input files.
