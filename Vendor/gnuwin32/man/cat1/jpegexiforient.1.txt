NAME
       jpegexiforient  -  reads  or writes the Exif Orientation
       Tag

SYNOPSIS
       jpegexiforient [switches] jpegfile

DESCRIPTION
        This is a utility program to get and set the Exif  Ori-
       entation Tag.
        It  can  be  used together with jpegtran in scripts for
       automatic
        orientation correction of digital camera pictures.

        The Exif orientation value gives the orientation of the
       camera
        relative to the scene when the image was captured.  The
       relation
        of the '0th row' and '0th column' to visual position is
       shown as
        below.

        Value | 0th Row     | 0th Column
        ------+-------------+-----------
          1   | top         | left side
          2   | top         | rigth side
          3   | bottom      | rigth side
          4   | bottom      | left side
          5   | left side   | top
          6   | right side  | top
          7   | right side  | bottom
          8   | left side   | bottom

        For  convenience,  here is what the letter F would look
       like if it were
        tagged  correctly  and  displayed  by  a  program  that
       ignores the orientation
        tag:
