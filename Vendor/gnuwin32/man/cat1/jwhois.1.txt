NAME
       jwhois - client for the whois service

SYNOPSIS
       jwhois  [ OPTIONS ]...  [ QUERY ]

DESCRIPTION
       jwhois searches Whois servers for the object on the com-
       mand line.

       The host to query is taken from a  global  configuration
       file,  a  configuration  file  specified  on the command
       line, or selected directly on the command line.


OPTIONS
       --version
              display version, authors and  licensing  informa-
              tion.

       --help display a short help text.

       -c FILE --config=FILE
              uses  FILE as a configuration file instead of the
              default.

       -h HOST --host=HOST
              overrides any hosts in the configuration file and
              queries HOST directly.

       -p PORT --port=PORT
              specifies  a  port  number to use when querying a
              HOST.

       -f --force-lookup
              forces a query to be made to a  host  even  if  a
              current object is available from the cache.

       -v --verbose
              outputs  verbose debugging information while run-
              ning (use this  before  sending  a  bugreport  to
              ensure  that  it's indeed a bug and not a miscon-
              figuration). You can increase  the  verbosity  by
              giving  several  verbose commands to jwhois, such
              as -vv.

       -n --no-redirect
              disable features that redirect queries  from  one
              server to another.

       -s --no-whoisservers
              disable   the   built-in   support   for   whois-
              servers.net.

       -a --raw
              send query verbatim to receiving hosts instead of
              rewriting them according to the configuration.

       -i --display-redirections
              display  every  step in a redirection (default is
              to display only the last answer).

       -d --disable-cache
              completely disable both reading  and  writing  to
              cache.

       -r --rwhois
              force  the  query  to  use  the  rwhois protocoll
              instead of HTTP or whois.

       --rwhois-display=DISPLAY
              asks receiving  rwhois  servers  to  display  the
              results  in  the  DISPLAY  display instead of the
              default dump display.

       --rwhois-limit=LIMIT
              asks receiving  rwhois  servers  to  limit  their
              responses to LIMIT matches.


   RIPE EXTENSIONS
       To  use  the options specified in RIPE Document 157, you
       need to change the format of the query slightly.  If you
       were  to  search  for  all  entries in the RIPE database
       which lists the admin-c, tech-c or zone-c as  CO19-RIPE,
       you could use the following command syntax:

       jwhois  -h  whois.ripe.net  --  -i admin-c,tech-c,zone-c
       CO19-RIPE

       -- is used to separate the RIPE options from the  jwhois
       options.
