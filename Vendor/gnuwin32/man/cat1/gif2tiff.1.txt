NAME
       gif2tiff  - create a TIFF file from a GIF87 format image
       file

SYNOPSIS
       gif2tiff [ options ] input.gif output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       Gif2tiff converts a file in the GIF87  format  to  TIFF.
       The  TIFF image is created as a palette image, with sam-
       ples compressed with the Lempel-Ziv  &  Welch  algorithm
       (Compression=5).   These characteristics can overridden,
       or  explicitly  specified  with  the  options  described
       below.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify  a compression scheme to use when writing
              image data: -c none for no compression, -c  pack-
              bits  for  the PackBits compression algorithm, -c
              zip for the Deflate compression algorithm, and -c
              lzw for Lempel-Ziv & Welch (the default).

       -r     Write  data  with  a specified number of rows per
              strip; by default the  number  of  rows/strip  is
              selected  so  that  each strip is approximately 8
              kilobytes.

NOTES
       The program is based on Paul Haeberli's fromgif  program
       which,  in  turn,  is  based  on  Marcel  J.E. Mol's GIF
       reader.

BUGS
       Should have more options to control output format.
