NAME
       crop - Change the size of an RLE image

SYNOPSIS
       crop  [  -b  ]  [ xmin ymin xmax ymax ] [ -o outfile ] [
       infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Crop changes the size of an RLE image.  The command line
       numbers  xmin  ymin  xmax ymax specify the bounds of the
       resulting image.  If the resulting image is larger  than
       the original, crop supplies blank pixels, otherwise pix-
       els are thrown away.

OPTIONS
       -b     The input image is cropped to the enclosing  box.
              Extra  rows  and  columns  of  black  pixels  are
              removed.  The infile must be  a  file;  no  piped
              input is allowed for this option.

       -o outfile
              If  specified,  output  will  be  written to this
              file, otherwise it will go to stdout.

       infile The input will be read from this file, otherwise,
              input will be taken from stdin.

BUGS
       Could  be combined with repos.  Does not check to see if
       the input and output regions are disjoint.
