RLETOASCII(1)                                     RLETOASCII(1)





NAME
       rletoascii - Print an RLE image as ASCII chars.

SYNOPSIS
       rletoascii  [  -S  asciistr  ]  [  -r ] [ -o outfile ] [
       infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rletoascii reads a file in RLE(5) format, converts it to
       black and white, then dumps it as ASCII characters.  The
       0 to 255 range of pixel values in the image is scaled to
       the length of asciistr and a the character at that posi-
       tion in the string is printed  for  each  pixel.   Input
       will  be  read  from  infile if specified, from standard
       input, otherwise.  Output dumps to standard  output,  or
       outfile, if specified.

       Usually, the input will need to be resized by fant(1) or
       rlezoom(1) to make it small enough to fit on the  screen
       and  to  adjust the pixel aspect ratio to the "character
       aspect ratio" of the terminal.  To get  it  "right  side
       up", use rleflip(1) with the -v option.  Finally, it may
       be  helpful  to  maximize   the   dynamic   range   with
       rlespiff(1).

OPTIONS
       -S asciistr
              Specifies  the range of ascii characters for con-
              version.         The        default        string
              (@BR*#$PX0woIcv:+!~".,  )  was  designed  to look
              good with the X 6x13 font.

       -r     Reverse video.  This causes the 0 to 255 range to
              be mapped to the reverse of the ascii string.

DEFICIENCIES
       Could be rewritten to use overprinting for output  to  a
       real printer.
