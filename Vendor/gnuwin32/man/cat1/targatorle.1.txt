TARGATORLE(1)                                     TARGATORLE(1)





NAME
       targatorle - Convert Truevision TARGA images to RLE for-
       mat.

SYNOPSIS
       targatorle [ -h headerfile ] [ -n nchannels ] [ -o  out-
       file.rle ] [ infile.tga ]

DESCRIPTION
       Targatorle  converts a file from Truevision's TARGA for-
       mat into RLE format.  If no input file is specified, the
       data  is  read  from  stdin.  Targatorle recognizes (but
       cannot necessarily process) all of  the  image  subtypes
       defined by the 1989 TARGA 2.0 specification:

            0 - Header Only, No Image Data
            1 - Uncompressed, Color-mapped Image
            2 - Uncompressed, True-color Image
            3 - Uncompressed, B/W (gray scale) Image
            9 - Run-length encoded, Color-mapped Image
           10 - Run-length encoded, True-color Image
           11 - Run-length encoded, B/W Image

       Targatorle should correctly process images in formats 0,
       2, 3, 10, and 11.  No support is currently available for
       color mapped images.

OPTIONS
       -h     Allow  the program to write TARGA header informa-
              tion to headerfile

       -n     where nchannels is 3 or 4.  If input is  a  color
              image,  copy  only  nchannels  of the TARGA file;
              this allows the alpha channel to be stripped.  By
              default,  the  alpha  channel  will  be copied if
              present.

       -o     Use outfile as output instead of stdout.

LIMITATIONS
       The TARGA image descriptor byte is  ignored;  therefore,
       the image origin is assumed to be that of RLE(5) (bottom
       left).  None of the color-mapped TARGA formats (types  1
       and 9) are supported.  Finally, no attempt has been made
       to support extensions to the TARGA  File  Format  intro-
       duced  by  Truevision  in  1989  (new  support  for time
       stamps, comments, user-defined data fields, etc.).
