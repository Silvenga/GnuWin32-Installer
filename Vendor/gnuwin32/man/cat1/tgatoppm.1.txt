NAME
       tgatoppm - convert TrueVision Targa file to a PPM image


SYNOPSIS
       tgatoppm

       [--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}]

       [--headerdump]

       tga-filename

       All  options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
       prefix.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       tgatoppm reads a TrueVision Targa file as input and pro-
       duces a PPM image as output.


OPTIONS
       --alphaout=alpha-filename
              tgatoppm   creates  a  PGM  image  containing the
              alpha channel values in the input image.  If  the
              input image doesn't contain an alpha channel, the
              alpha-filename file contains all zero  (transpar-
              ent)   alpha   values.    If  you  don't  specify
              --alphaout, tgatoppm does not generate  an  alpha
              file,  and  if the input image has an alpha chan-
              nel, tgatoppm simply discards it.

              If you specify - as the filename, tgatoppm writes
              the  alpha output to Standard Output and discards
              the image.

              See  pamcomp(1)foronewaytouse  the  alpha  output
              file.


       --headerdump
              Causes  tgatoppm to dump information from the TGA
              header to Standard Error.
