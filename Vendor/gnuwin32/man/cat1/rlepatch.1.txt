RLEPATCH(1)                                         RLEPATCH(1)





NAME
       rlepatch  - patch smaller RLE files over a larger image.

SYNOPSIS
       rlepatch [ -o outfile ] infile patchfiles...


DESCRIPTION
       Rlepatch puts smaller RLE files on top of a  larger  RLE
       image.   One  use  for  rlepatch is to place small "fix"
       images on top of a larger image that took a long time to
       compute.  Along with repos(1), rlepatch can also be used
       as a simple way to build image mosaics.

       Unlike rlecomp(1), rlepatch does not perform any  arith-
       metic  on  the pixels.  If the patch images overlap, the
       patches specified last cover those specified first.

       If the input files each contain  multiple  images,  they
       are  treated  as  streams  of  images  merging to form a
       stream of output images.  I.e., the nth  image  in  each
       input  file  becomes part of the nth image in the output
       file.  The process ceases as  soon  as  any  input  file
       reaches its end.

OPTIONS
       infile The background image will be read from this file.
              If input is to be taken from stdin, "-"  must  be
              specified here.

       -o outfile
              If  specified,  output  will  be  written to this
              file, otherwise it will go to stdout.

BUGS
       Rlepatch uses the "row" interface to  the  RLE  library.
       It would run much faster using the "raw" interface, par-
       ticularly for placing small patches over a large  image.
       Even  fixing  it  to work like rlecomp (which uses "raw"
       mode only for non-overlapping images) would make a major
       improvement.
