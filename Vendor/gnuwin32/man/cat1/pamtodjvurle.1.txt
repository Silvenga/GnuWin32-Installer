HISTORY
       pamtodjvurle  was new in Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004) but a
       program that did almost the same thing,  called  ppmtod-
       jvurle,  was  in  Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004).  The latter
       was written and contributed to  Netpbm  by  Scott  Pakin
       <scott+pbm@pakin.org>.    pamtodjvurle  uses  techniques
       taken from ppmtodjvurle, but no code is  copied  between
       them.
