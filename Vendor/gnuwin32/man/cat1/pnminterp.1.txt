NAME
       pnminterp - replaced by pamstretch

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnminterp was replaced in Netpbm 9.21 (December 2001) by
       pamstretch(1).

       pamstretch is backward compatible  with  pnminterp,  but
       also  recognizes PAM input, including that with an alpha
       channel.
