NAME
       bmptopnm  -  convert  a BMP file into a PBM, PGM, or PNM
       image


SYNOPSIS
       bmptopnm [bmpfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       bmptopnm reads a Microsoft Windows or OS/2 BMP  file  as
       input.  and produces a PBM, PGM, or PNM image as output.
       If the input is colormapped and contains only black  and
       white,  the  output is PBM.  If the input is colormapped
       and contains only black white and gray,  the  output  is
       PGM.  Otherwise, the output is PPM.

       This  program  cannot  convert BMP files with compressed
       (run length encoded, JPEG, PNG) image data.   It  recog-
       nizes the compression and issues an error message.

       Before Netpbm 10.18 (September 2003), this program could
       not convert BMP  images  with  the  BI_BITFIELDS  format
       ("compression type").  It would recognize the format and
       issue an error message.

        This program cannot convert OS/2 BMP files with 16 bits
       per  pixel  (only because the author did not have a com-
       plete specification for them).  It recognizes the format
       and  issues an error message.  Before Netpbm 10.16 (June
       2003), it also could not convert Windows BMP files  with
       16 bits per pixel.
