NAME
       sgi2tiff - create a TIFF file from an SGI image file

SYNOPSIS
       sgi2tiff [ options ] input.rgb output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       sgi2tiff  converts  a  file  in  the SGI image format to
       TIFF.  By default, the TIFF image is created  with  data
       samples  packed (PlanarConfiguration=1), compressed with
       the Lempel-Ziv & Welch  algorithm  (Compression=5),  and
       with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.  These charac-
       teristics can overridden, or explicitly  specified  with
       the options described below.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify  a compression scheme to use when writing
              image data: -c none for no compression, -c  pack-
              bits  for the PackBits compression algorithm), -c
              jpeg for the baseline JPEG compression algorithm,
              -c zip for the Deflate compression algorithm, and
              -c lzw for Lempel-Ziv & Welch (the default).

       -p     Explicitly select the planar  configuration  used
              in  organizing  data samples in the output image:
              -p contig for samples packed contiguously, and -p
              separate   for  samples  stored  separately.   By
              default samples are packed.

       -r     Write data with a specified number  of  rows  per
              strip;  by  default  the  number of rows/strip is
              selected so that each strip  is  approximately  8
              kilobytes.

BUGS
       Does not record colormap information.
