NAME
       xwdtopnm  -  convert an X11 or X10 window dump file to a
       PNM image


SYNOPSIS
       xwdtopnm [-verbose] [-headerdump] [xwdfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       xwdtopnm reads an X11 or X10 window dump file  as  input
       and  produces  a  PNM  image as output.  The type of the
       output image depends on the input file - if  it's  black
       and  white,  the  output is PBM.  If it's grayscale, the
       output is PGM.  Otherwise, it's PPM.  The program  tells
       you which type it is writing.

       Using  this  program,  you  can convert anything you can
       display on an X workstation's screen into a  PNM  image.
       Just  display whatever you're interested in, run the xwd
       program to capture the contents of the  window,  run  it
       through xwdtopnm, and then use pamcut to select the part
       you want.

       Note that a pseudocolor XWD image  (typically  what  you
       get  when you make a dump of a pseudocolor X window) has
       maxval 65535, which means the  PNM  file  that  xwdtopnm
       generates has maxval 65535.  Many older image processing
       programs (that aren't part of  the  Netpbm  package  and
       don't use the Netpbm programming library) don't know how
       to handle a PNM  image  with  maxval  greater  than  255
       (because  there  are  two  bytes instead of one for each
       sample in the image).  So you may want to run the output
       of xwdtopnm through pnmdepth before feeding it to one of
       these old programs.


OPTIONS
       -verbose
              This option  causes  xwdtopnm  to  display  handy
              information about the input image and the conver-
              sion process


       -headerdump
              This option causes xwdtopnm to display  the  con-
              tents  of  the X11 header.  It has no effect when
              the input is X10.  This option was new in  Netpbm
              10.26 (December 2004).
