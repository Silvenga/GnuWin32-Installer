NAME
       tiffgt - display an image stored in a TIFF file (Silicon
       Graphics version)

SYNOPSIS
       tiffgt [ options ] input.tif ...

DESCRIPTION
       tiffgt displays one or more images stored using the  Tag
       Image  File  Format, Revision 6.0.  Each image is placed
       in a fixed size window that the user  must  position  on
       the  display  (unless  configured  otherwise  through  X
       defaults).  If the display has fewer than 24  bitplanes,
       or  if  the  image does not warrant full color, then RGB
       color values are mapped to the closest values that exist
       in  the  colormap  (this  is done using the rgbi routine
       found in the graphics utility library -lgutil.)

       tiffgt correctly handles files with any of the following
       characteristics:
            BitsPerSample              1, 2, 4, 8, 16
            SamplesPerPixel            1, 3, 4 (the 4th sample is ignored)
            PhotometricInterpretation  0 (min-is-white), 1 (min-is-black), 2 (RGB), 3 (palette), 6 (YCbCr)
            PlanarConfiguration        1 (contiguous), 2 (separate)
            Orientation                1 (top-left), 4 (bottom-left)
       Data may be organized as strips or tiles and may be com-
       pressed with any of the compression algorithms supported
       by the libtiff(3) library.

       For palette images (PhotometricInterpretation=3), tiffgt
       inspects the colormap values and assumes  either  16-bit
       or  8-bit  values  according to the maximum value.  That
       is, if no colormap entry  greater  than  255  is  found,
       tiffgt  assumes the colormap has only 8-bit values; oth-
       erwise it assumes 16-bit  values.   This  inspection  is
       done  to  handle  old images written by previous (incor-
       rect) versions of libtiff.

       tiffgt can be used to display multiple images  one-at-a-
       time.  The left mouse button switches the display to the
       first image in the next file in the list of files speci-
       fied  on  the  command  line.   The  right  mouse button
       switches to the first image in the previous file in  the
       list.  The middle mouse button causes the first image in
       the first file specified on the command line to be  dis-
       played.  In addition the following keyboard commands are
       recognized:

       b      Use a PhotometricInterpretation of MinIsBlack  in
              displaying the current image.

       l      Use  a  FillOrder  of  lsb-to-msb in decoding the
              current image.

       m      Use a FillOrder of  msb-to-lsb  in  decoding  the
              current image.

       c      Use  a  colormap  visual  to  display the current
              image.

       r      Use a true color (24-bit RGB) visual  to  display
              the current image.

       w      Use  a PhotometricInterpretation of MinIsWhite in
              displaying the current image.

       W      Toggle (enable/disable) display of  warning  mes-
              sages from the TIFF library when decoding images.

       E      Toggle (enable/disable) display of error messages
              from the TIFF library when decoding images.

       z      Reset  all  parameters  to their default settings
              (FillOrder,  PhotometricInterpretation,  handling
              of warnings and errors).

       PageUp Display the previous image in the current file or
              the last image in the previous file.

       PageDown
              Display the next image in the current file or the
              first image in the next file.

       Home   Display the first image in the current file.

       End    Display the last image in the current file (unim-
              plemented).

OPTIONS
       -c     Force image display in a colormap window.

       -d     Specify an image to display by directory  number.
              By  default  the  first image in the file is dis-
              played.  Directories  are  numbered  starting  at
              zero.

       -e     Enable  reporting of error messages from the TIFF
              library.   By  default  tiffgt  silently  ignores
              images that cannot be read.

       -f     Force  tiffgt to run as a foreground process.  By
              default tiffgt will place  itself  in  the  back-
              ground  once  it  has  opened the requested image
              file.

       -l     Force the presumed bit ordering to be LSB to MSB.

       -m     Force the presumed bit ordering to be MSB to LSB.

       -o     Specify an image to display by directory  offset.
              By  default  the  first image in the file is dis-
              played.  Directories  offsets  may  be  specified
              using  C-style  syntax; i.e. a leading ``0x'' for
              hexadecimal and a leading ``0'' for octal.

       -p     Override the value of the  PhotometricInterpreta-
              tion  tag;  the  parameter  may  be  one of: min-
              iswhite, minisblack, rgb,  palette,  mask,  sepa-
              rated, ycbcr, and cielab.

       -r     Force image display in a full color window.

       -s     Stop  on  the  first  read error.  By default all
              errors in the input data are ignored  and  tiffgt
              does  it's best to display as much of an image as
              possible.

       -w     Enable reporting of  warning  messages  from  the
              TIFF  library.  By default tiffgt ignores warning
              messages generated when reading an image.

       -v     Place information in  the  title  bar  describing
              what  type  of window (full color or colormap) is
              being used, the name of the input file,  and  the
              directory  index  of the image (if non-zero).  By
              default, the window type  is  not  shown  in  the
              title bar.

BUGS
       Images  wider  and  taller than the display are silently
       truncated to avoid crashing old versions of  the  window
       manager.
