NAME
       rlescale - produce gray scale images.

SYNOPSIS
       rlescale [ -c ] [ -n nsteps ] [ -o outfile ] [ xsize ] [
       ysize ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rlescale produces an RLE image  containing  a  (more-or-
       less) standard gray scale image.  Along the bottom are 8
       colored patches (in the standard primary  and  secondary
       colors).  Above these are a sequences of logarithmically
       scaled gray patches.  By default, a  16  step  scale  is
       produced.   The  size of the output file (default 512 by
       480) can be set with the xsize and ysize arguments.

OPTIONS
       -c     Produce red, green, blue, and gray scales.

       -n nsteps
              Specify the number of steps to be produced.
