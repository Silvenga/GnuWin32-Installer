NAME
       yuvsplittoppm  - convert separate Y, U, and V files into
       a PPM image


SYNOPSIS
       yuvsplittoppm

       basename width height [-ccir601]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       yuvsplittoppm reads three files, containing the YUV com-
       ponents,  as  input.   These files are basename.Y, base-
       name.U, and basename.V.  Produces a portable  pixmap  on
       stdout.

       Since  the YUV files are raw files, the dimensions width
       and height must be specified on the command line.


OPTIONS
       -ccir601
              Assumes that the YUV triplets are scaled into the
              smaller  range  of  the CCIR 601 (MPEG) standard.
              Else, the JFIF (JPEG) standard is assumed.
