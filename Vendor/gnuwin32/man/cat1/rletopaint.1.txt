RLETOPAINT(1)                                     RLETOPAINT(1)





NAME
       rletopaint  -  convert  an  RLE  file to MacPaint format
       using dithering

SYNOPSIS
       rletopaint [ -l ] [ -r ] [ -g [ gamma  ]  ]  [  -o  out-
       file.paint ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rletopaint  converts  a  file from RLE(5) format to Mac-
       Paint format.  The program  uses  dithering  to  convert
       from a full 24 bit color image to a bitmapped image.  If
       the RLE file is larger than a MacPaint  image  (576x720)
       it is cropped to fit.

       Because  MacPaint  files have their coordinate origin in
       the upper left instead of the lower left, the  RLE  file
       should be piped through rleflip(1) -v before rletopaint.

       The resulting file can be downloaded to a  Macintosh  in
       binary  mode,  and  should be given a type of PNTG and a
       creator of MPNT, so it will be recognized as a  MacPaint
       file.

OPTIONS
       -l     Use  a  linear map in the conversion from 24 bits
              to bitmapped output.

       -g [ gamma ]
              Use a gamma map of gamma (gamma  is  2.0  if  not
              specified).

       -r     Invert  the  sense of the output pixels (white on
              black instead of black  on  white).   For  normal
              images, you probably want this flag.

BUGS
       Should use a color map in the file, if present.
