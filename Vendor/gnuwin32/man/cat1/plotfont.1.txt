PLOTFONT(1)          GNU Plotting Utilities         PLOTFONT(1)





NAME
       plotfont  - produce character maps of fonts supported by
       the plotting utilities

SYNOPSIS
       plotfont [ options ] fonts

DESCRIPTION
       plotfont produces a character map for any font  that  is
       supported  by  the  plotting  utilities,  which  include
       graph(1), plot(1), pic2plot(1), tek2plot(1), and the GNU
       libplot  2-D  graphics  export  library  (see  plot(3)).
       Which fonts are supported depends on the  output  format
       or display type, which is specified by the -T option.  A
       listing of the fonts available in any  specified  output
       format may be obtained with the --help-fonts option (see
       below).

       The character map, or maps, will be written to  standard
       output in the specified format.  For example, the Times-
       Roman font is available when producing  Postscript  out-
       put.    The   command   plotfont  -T  ps  Times-Roman  >
       charmap.ps will yield a character map of the Times-Roman
       font,  in  a  Postscript  format  that  can be viewed or
       edited with the idraw(1)  drawing  editor.   The  Times-
       Roman  font is also available when producing Fig output,
       which can be viewed or edited with the  xfig(1)  drawing
       editor.   The  command  plotfont  -T  fig  Times-Roman >
       charmap.fig will yield the same character  map,  but  in
       Fig format rather than in Postscript format.

       As  another  example, the Univers font is available when
       producing PCL 5 output.  The  command  plotfont  -T  pcl
       Univers  >  charmap.pcl  will produce a character map of
       the Univers font, in PCL 5 format.

       When producing output for the X Window System, i.e., for
       a  popped-up  window,  any scalable X Window System font
       that has an XLFD (i.e., X Logical Font Description) name
       is  supported.   For  example, the command plotfont -T X
       utopia-medium-r-normal will pop up a window, and draw  a
       character  map  of  the  Utopia-Regular  font.  "utopia-
       medium-r-normal" is a truncated version of  the  Utopia-
       Regular  font's  XLFD  name.  The Utopia-Regular font is
       available on most X Window System displays.

OPTIONS
   General Options
       -T type
       --display-type type
              Select type as the output format or display type.
              It  may be "X", "png", "pnm", "gif", "svg", "ai",
              "ps",  "cgm",  "fig",  "pcl",  "hpgl",   "regis",
              "tek",  or  "meta"  (the  default).   These refer
              respectively to the X Window System, PNG  (Porta-
              ble  Network  Graphics)  format,  portable anymap
              format (PBM/PGM/PPM), a  pseudo-GIF  format  that
              does  not  use  LZW  encoding,  the new XML-based
              Scalable Vector Graphics format, the format  used
              by  Adobe Illustrator, Postscript or Encapsulated
              Postscript  (EPS)  that  can   be   edited   with
              idraw(1),  CGM  format (by default, confirming to
              the WebCGM  profile),  the  format  used  by  the
              xfig(1) drawing editor, the Hewlett-Packard PCL 5
              printer language,  the  Hewlett-Packard  Graphics
              Language,  ReGIS  graphics  format  (which can be
              displayed by the dxterm(1) terminal  emulator  or
              by  a  VT330 or VT340 terminal), Tektronix format
              (which can be displayed by the xterm(1)  terminal
              emulator),  and  device-independent  GNU metafile
              format itself.  Unless type  is  "X",  an  output
              file  is produced and written to standard output.

              Files in PNG, PNM, pseudo-GIF, AI, or Fig  format
              contain  only  a  single page of graphics.  So if
              the -T png option, the -T pnm option, the -T  gif
              option, the -T ai option, or the -T fig option is
              used, the output file will  contain  a  character
              map for only the first-specified font.

              A listing of the fonts available in any specified
              output  format   may   be   obtained   with   the
              --help-fonts  option (see below).  If a requested
              font is unavailable, a default font will be  sub-
              stituted.   The  default  font is "Helvetica" for
              "X",  "svg",  "ai",  "ps",  "cgm",   and   "fig",
              "Univers"   for  "pcl",  and  "HersheySerif"  for
              "png", "pnm", "gif", "hpgl", "regis", "tek",  and
              "meta".

       -1
       --lower-half
              Generate  a  character  map for the lower half of
              each specified font.  This is the default.

       -2
       --upper-half
              Generate a character map for the  upper  half  of
              each specified font.

       -o
       --octal
              Number  the  characters  in  octal rather than in
              decimal (the default).

       -x
       --hexadecimal
              Number the characters in hexadecimal rather  than
              in decimal (the default).

       --box  Surround  each  character with a box, showing its
              extent to left and right.  The default is not  to
              do this.

       -j row
       --jis-row row
              Generate  a  character  map  for  row  row  of  a
              Japanese font arranged according to JIS [Japanese
              Industrial  Standard]  X0208.  The only such font
              currently available is the  HersheyEUC  [Extended
              Unix  Code] font.  If used, this option overrides
              the -1  and  -2  options.   The  valid  rows  are
              1...94.  In the JIS X0208 standard, Roman charac-
              ters are located in row 3, and Japanese  syllabic
              characters (Hiragana and Katakana) are located in
              rows 4 and 5.  Greek and Cyrillic characters  are
              located  in  rows  6 and 7.  Japanese ideographic
              characters (Kanji) are located in rows 16...84.

       --bg-color name
              Set the color used for the background to be name.
              This  is relevant only to plotfont -T X, plotfont
              -T png, plotfont -T pnm, plotfont -T  gif,  plot-
              font  -T  svg,  plotfont  -T cgm, and plotfont -T
              regis.  An unrecognized name sets  the  color  to
              the  default,  which is "white".  The environment
              variable BG_COLOR can equally  well  be  used  to
              specify the background color.

              If  the -T png or -T gif option is used, a trans-
              parent PNG  file  or  a  transparent  pseudo-GIF,
              respectively,  may  be  produced  by  setting the
              TRANSPARENT_COLOR  environment  variable  to  the
              name  of  the background color.  If the -T svg or
              -T cgm option is used, an output file  without  a
              background  may  be produced by setting the back-
              ground color to "none".

       --bitmap-size bitmap_size
              Set the size of the graphics display in which the
              character  map(s) will be drawn, in terms of pix-
              els,  to  be   bitmap_size.    The   default   is
              "570x570".   This is relevant only to plotfont -T
              X, plotfont -T png, plotfont -T pnm, and plotfont
              -T  gif,  all  of  which produce bitmaps.  If you
              choose a rectangular  (non-square)  window  size,
              the  fonts in the character map(s) will be scaled
              anisotropically, i.e., by  different  factors  in
              the  horizontal  and  vertical  directions.   For
              plotfont -T X, this requires  an  X11R6  display.
              Any  font  that cannot be scaled in this way will
              be replaced by a default scalable font,  such  as
              the vector font "HersheySerif".

              The  environment  variable BITMAPSIZE can equally
              well be used to specify  the  window  size.   For
              backward    compatibility,    the    X   resource
              Xplot.geometry may be used instead.

       --emulate-color option
              If option is yes, replace each color in the  out-
              put  by  an  appropriate  shade of gray.  This is
              seldom useful, except when using plotfont -T  pcl
              to  prepare  output  for  a  PCL 5 device.  (Many
              monochrome PCL  5  devices,  such  as  monochrome
              LaserJets,  do  a  poor job of emulating color on
              their own.)  You may equally well  request  color
              emulation  by  setting  the  environment variable
              EMULATE_COLOR to "yes".

       --numbering-font name
              Set the font used for the numbering of the  char-
              acters in the character map(s) to be name, rather
              than the default.

       --page-size pagesize
              Set the size of size of the  page  on  which  the
              character  map(s)  will  be  positioned.  This is
              relevant only to plotfont -T svg, plotfont -T ai,
              plotfont -T ps, plotfont -T cgm, plotfont -T fig,
              plotfont -T  pcl,  and  plotfont  -T  hpgl.   The
              default  is  "letter", which means an 8.5 inch by
              11 inch page.  Any ISO page  size  in  the  range
              "a0"..."a4"  or  ANSI  page  size  in  the  range
              "a"..."e" may be specified ("letter" is an  alias
              for  "a"  and  "tabloid"  is  an  alias for "b").
              "legal" and "ledger" are  recognized  page  sizes
              also.   The  environment  variable  PAGESIZE  can
              equally well be used to specify the page size.

              The graphics display in which each character  map
              is  drawn  will  be  a  square  region that would
              occupy nearly the full  width  of  the  specified
              page.   An  alternative  size  for  the  graphics
              display can be specified.  For example, the  page
              size     could     be    specified    as    "let-
              ter,xsize=4in,ysize=6in",                      or
              "a4,xsize=5.0cm,ysize=100mm".   For  all  of  the
              above except plotfont -T hpgl, the graphics  dis-
              play  will,  by default, be centered on the page.
              For all of the above except plotfont -T  svg  and
              plotfont  -T  cgm,  the  graphics  display may be
              repositioned manually, by specifying the location
              of  its  lower left corner, relative to the lower
              left corner of the page.  For example,  the  page
              size   could   be   specified   as  "letter,xori-
              gin=2in,yorigin=3in", or  "a4,xorigin=0.5cm,yori-
              gin=0.5cm".   It  is  also possible to specify an
              offset vector.  For example, the page size  could
              be  specified  as  "letter,xoffset=1in", or "let-
              ter,xoffset=1in,yoffset=1.2in",   or    "a4,yoff-
              set=-1cm".  In SVG format and WebCGM format it is
              possible to specify the size of the graphics dis-
              play, but not its position.

       --rotation angle
              Rotate  the  graphics  display  by angle degrees.
              Recognized  values  are  "0",  "90",  "180",  and
              "270".   "no" and "yes" are equivalent to "0" and
              "90",  respectively.   The  environment  variable
              ROTATION  can  also be used to specify a rotation
              angle.

       --pen-color name
              Set the pen color to be  name.   An  unrecognized
              name  sets the pen color to the default, which is
              "black".

   Options for Metafile Output
       The following option is relevant only if the  -T  option
       is omitted or if -T meta is used.  In this case the out-
       put of plotfont will be in GNU graphics metafile format.
       It  may  be  translated  to  other  formats  by invoking
       plot(1).

       -O
       --portable-output
              Output the portable (human-readable)  version  of
              GNU  metafile format, rather than the binary ver-
              sion (the default).  The  format  of  the  binary
              version is machine-dependent.

   Informational Options
       --help Print a list of command-line options, and exit.

       --help-fonts
              Print  a table of available fonts, and exit.  The
              table will depend on which output format or  dis-
              play type is specified with the -T option.  plot-
              font -T X, plotfont -T svg, plotfont -T ai, plot-
              font  -T ps, plotfont -T cgm, and plotfont -T fig
              each support the 35  standard  Postscript  fonts.
              plotfont -T svg, plotfont -T pcl, and plotfont -T
              hpgl support the 45 standard PCL 5 fonts, and the
              latter  two  support  a number of Hewlett-Packard
              vector fonts.  All seven support a set of 22 Her-
              shey  vector  fonts, as do plotfont -T png, plot-
              font -T pnm, plotfont -T gif, plotfont -T  regis,
              and  plotfont  -T  tek.   plotfont  without  a -T
              option in principle supports any of these  fonts,
              since its output must be translated to other for-
              mats by invoking plot(1).

       --list-fonts
              Like --help-fonts, but lists the fonts in a  sin-
              gle  column  to  facilitate  piping to other pro-
              grams.  If no output format is specified with the
              -T  option,  the  full  set of supported fonts is
              listed.

       --version
              Print the version  number  of  plotfont  and  the
              plotting utilities package, and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       The    environment   variables   BITMAPSIZE,   PAGESIZE,
       BG_COLOR, EMULATE_COLOR, and ROTATION serve  as  backups
       for  the options --bitmap-size, --page-size, --bg-color,
       --emulate-color,  and  --rotation,  respectively.    The
       remaining environment variables are specific to individ-
       ual output formats.

       plotfont -T X, which pops up a window  on  an  X  Window
       System  display  for each character map, checks the DIS-
       PLAY environment variable.   Its  value  determines  the
       display that will be used.

       plotfont  -T png and plotfont -T gif, which produce out-
       put in PNG format and  pseudo-GIF  format  respectively,
       are  affected by the INTERLACE environment variable.  If
       its value is  "yes",  the  output  will  be  interlaced.
       Also,  if  the TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment variable is
       set to the name of a color, that color will  be  treated
       as transparent in the output.

       plotfont  -T  pnm,  which  produces  output  in portable
       anymap (PBM/PGM/PPM) format, is affected by the PNM_POR-
       TABLE  environment variable.  If its value is "yes", the
       output will be in a human-readable  format  rather  than
       binary (the default).

       plotfont  -T cgm, which produces output in CGM (Computer
       Graphics  Metafile)   format,   is   affected   by   the
       CGM_MAX_VERSION  and CGM_ENCODING environment variables.
       By default, it produces a binary-encoded version of  CGM
       version  3 format.  For backward compatibility, the ver-
       sion number may be reduced by setting CGM_MAX_VERSION to
       "2"  or  "1".   Irrespective  of version, the output CGM
       file will use the human-readable clear text encoding  if
       CGM_ENCODING  is  set  to  "clear_text".   However, only
       binary-encoded CGM files conform to the WebCGM  profile.

       plotfont  -T  pcl,  which  produces  PCL  5  output  for
       Hewlett-Packard printers and plotters,  is  affected  by
       the  environment  variable PCL_ASSIGN_COLORS.  It should
       be set to "yes" when producing PCL 5 output for a  color
       printer  or  other color device.  This will ensure accu-
       rate color reproduction by giving the output device com-
       plete  freedom  in  assigning colors, internally, to its
       "logical pens".  If it is "no" then the device will  use
       a fixed set of colored pens, and will emulate other col-
       ors by shading.  The default is "no" because  monochrome
       PCL  5  devices, which are much more common than colored
       ones, must use shading to emulate color.

       plotfont -T hpgl, which produces Hewlett-Packard  Graph-
       ics  Language output, is affected by several environment
       variables.  The most important  is  HPGL_VERSION,  which
       may  be  set  to  "1", "1.5", or "2" (the default).  "1"
       means that the output should  be  generic  HP-GL,  "1.5"
       means that the output should be suitable for the HP7550A
       graphics plotter and the  HP758x,  HP7595A  and  HP7596A
       drafting  plotters (HP-GL with some HP-GL/2 extensions),
       and "2" means that the output should be modern  HP-GL/2.
       If  the  version is "1" or "1.5" then the only available
       fonts will be vector fonts, and all lines will be  drawn
       with  a  default width.  Additionally, if the version is
       "1" then the filling  of  arbitrary  curves  with  solid
       color  will  not  be  supported  (circles and rectangles
       aligned with the coordinate axes may be filled, though).

       The position of the plotfont -T hpgl graphics display on
       the page can be rotated 90 degrees  counterclockwise  by
       setting  the  HPGL_ROTATE environment variable to "yes".
       This is not the same as the rotation obtained  with  the
       --rotation  option,  since  it both rotates the graphics
       display and repositions its  lower  left  corner  toward
       another  corner  of  the  page.  Besides "no" and "yes",
       recognized values for HPGL_ROTATE are "0", "90",  "180",
       and  "270".   "no"  and  "yes" are equivalent to "0" and
       "90", respectively.  "180" and "270" are supported  only
       if HPGL_VERSION is "2" (the default).

       By  default, plotfont -T hpgl will draw with a fixed set
       of pens.  Which pens are present  may  be  specified  by
       setting   the   HPGL_PENS   environment   variable.   If
       HPGL_VERSION is "1", the default value of  HPGL_PENS  is
       "1=black";  if HPGL_VERSION is "1.5" or "2", the default
       value  of  HPGL_PENS  is   "1=black:2=red:3=green:4=yel-
       low:5=blue:6=magenta:7=cyan".    The  format  should  be
       self-explanatory.  By setting HPGL_PENS you may  specify
       a  color  for  any pen in the range #1...#31.  All color
       names recognized by the X Window  System  may  be  used.
       Pen  #1  must  always  be present, though it need not be
       black.  Any other pen in the range #1...#31 may be omit-
       ted.

       If  HPGL_VERSION  is "2" then plotfont -T hpgl will also
       be affected by the environment variable HPGL_ASSIGN_COL-
       ORS.   If its value is "yes", then plotfont -T hpgl will
       not be restricted to the palette specified in HPGL_PENS:
       it  will  assign  colors  to "logical pens" in the range
       #1...#31, as needed.  The default value is "no"  because
       other  than  color LaserJet printers and DesignJet plot-
       ters, not many HP-GL/2 devices allow the  assignment  of
       colors to logical pens.

       Opaque  filling  and  the drawing of visible white lines
       are supported only if HPGL_VERSION is "2" and the  envi-
       ronment   variable   HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE   is   "yes"  (the
       default).  If its value is "no"  then  white  lines  (if
       any),  which are normally drawn with pen #0, will not be
       drawn.  This feature is  to  accommodate  older  HP-GL/2
       devices.  HP-GL/2 pen plotters, for example, do not sup-
       port opacity or the use of pen #0 to draw visible  white
       lines.   Some  older  HP-GL/2 devices may, in fact, mal-
       function if asked to draw opaque objects.

       plotfont -T tek, which produces output for  a  Tektronix
       terminal  or emulator, checks the TERM environment vari-
       able.  If the value of TERM is a string  beginning  with
       "xterm",  "nxterm",  or  "kterm",  it is taken as a sign
       that plotfont is running in an  X  Window  System  VT100
       terminal  emulator:  a  copy  of xterm(1), nxterm(1), or
       kterm(1).  Before drawing graphics, plotfont -T tek will
       emit  an escape sequence that causes the terminal emula-
       tor's auxiliary Tektronix window, which is normally hid-
       den, to pop up.  After the graphics are drawn, an escape
       sequence that returns control to the original VT100 win-
       dow  will  be emitted.  The Tektronix window will remain
       on the screen.

       If the value of TERM is a string  beginning  with  "ker-
       mit",  "ansi.sys", or "nansi.sys", it is taken as a sign
       that plotfont is running in the VT100 terminal  emulator
       provided  by  the  MS-DOS  version of kermit(1).  Before
       drawing graphics, plotfont -T tek will  emit  an  escape
       sequence  that  switches  the  terminal emulator to Tek-
       tronix mode.  Also, some of the Tektronix control  codes
       emitted  by  plotfont  -T  tek  will be kermit-specific.
       There will be a limited amount of color  support,  which
       is  not normally the case (the 16 `ansi.sys' colors will
       be supported).  After drawing graphics, plotfont -T  tek
       will  emit  an escape sequence that returns the emulator
       to VT100 mode.  The key  sequence  `ALT  minus'  can  be
       employed  manually  within  kermit to switch between the
       two modes.
