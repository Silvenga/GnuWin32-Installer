NAME
       pdfinfo - Portable Document Format (PDF) document infor-
       mation extractor (version 2.03)

SYNOPSIS
       pdfinfo [options] [PDF-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdfinfo prints the contents  of  the  'Info'  dictionary
       (plus  some  other  useful  information) from a Portable
       Document Format (PDF) file.

       The 'Info' dictionary contains the following values:

              title
              subject
              keywords
              author
              creator
              producer
              creation date
              modification date

       In addition, the following information is printed:

              tagged (yes/no)
              page count
              encrypted flag (yes/no)
              print and copy permissions (if encrypted)
              page size
              file size
              linearized (yes/no)
              PDF version
              metadata (only if requested)

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Pdfinfo reads a configuration file at startup.  It first
       tries to find the user's private config file, ~/.xpdfrc.
       If that doesn't exist, it looks for a system-wide config
       file, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc (but this location
       can  be  changed  when  pdfinfo  is  built).   See   the
       xpdfrc(5) man page for details.

OPTIONS
       Many of the following options can be set with configura-
       tion file commands.  These are listed in square brackets
       with  the  description of the corresponding command line
       option.

       -f number
              Specifies the first page to examine.  If multiple
              pages  are  requested  using  the  "-f"  and "-l"
              options, the  size  of  each  requested  page  is
              printed.  Otherwise, only page one is examined.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to examine.

       -meta  Prints  document-level  metadata.   (This  is the
              "Metadata" stream from  the  PDF  file's  Catalog
              object.)

       -enc encoding-name
              Sets  the  encoding  to use for text output.  The
              encoding-name must be defined with the unicodeMap
              command   (see   xpdfrc(5)).   This  defaults  to
              "Latin1" (which is a built-in encoding).  [config
              file: textEncoding]

       -opw password
              Specify  the  owner  password  for  the PDF file.
              Providing this will bypass all security  restric-
              tions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -cfg config-file
              Read  config-file  in  place  of ~/.xpdfrc or the
              system-wide config file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help and  --help  are
              equivalent.)

EXIT CODES
       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
