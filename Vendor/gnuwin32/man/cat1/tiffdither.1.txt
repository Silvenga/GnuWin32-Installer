NAME
       tiffdither  - convert a greyscale image to bilevel using
       dithering

SYNOPSIS
       tiffdither [ options ] input.tif output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       tiffdither converts a  single  channel  8-bit  greyscale
       image  to  a  bilevel  image using Floyd-Steinberg error
       propagation with thresholding.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify the compression to use for  data  written
              to  the  output  file:  none  for no compression,
              packbits for PackBits compression, lzw  for  Lem-
              pel-Ziv & Welch compression, zip for Deflate com-
              pression, g3 for CCITT Group 3 (T.4) compression,
              and  g4  for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) compression.  By
              default tiffdither will compress  data  according
              to  the value of the Compression tag found in the
              source file.

              The CCITT Group 3 and Group 4  compression  algo-
              rithms can only be used with bilevel data.

              Group  3  compression  can  be specified together
              with  several  T.4-specific   options:   1d   for
              1-dimensional   encoding,  2d  for  2-dimensional
              encoding, and fill to force each encoded scanline
              to  be  zero-filled  so  that the terminating EOL
              code lies on a byte boundary.   Group  3-specific
              options  are specified by appending a ``:''-sepa-
              rated  list  to  the  ``g3''  option;  e.g.    -c
              g3:2d:fill  to  get  2D-encoded  data  with byte-
              aligned EOL codes.

              LZW compression can be specified together with  a
              predictor  value.   A predictor value of 2 causes
              each scanline of the output image to undergo hor-
              izontal  differencing  before  it  is  encoded; a
              value of 1 forces each  scanline  to  be  encoded
              without  differencing.   LZW-specific options are
              specified by appending a ``:''-separated list  to
              the  ``lzw''  option; e.g.  -c lzw:2 for LZW com-
              pression with horizontal differencing.

       -f     Specify the bit fill order to use in writing out-
              put  data.   By default, tiffdither will create a
              new file with the same fill order as  the  origi-
              nal.  Specifying -f lsb2msb will force data to be
              written with the FillOrder tag set to  LSB2MSB  ,
              while  -f  msb2lsb  will force data to be written
              with the FillOrder tag set to MSB2LSB .

       -t     Set  the  threshold  value  for  dithering.    By
              default the threshold value is 128.

NOTES
       The  dither  algorithm  is  taken from the tiffmedian(1)
       program (written by Paul Heckbert).
