NAME
       pamtouil - convert a PNM or PNM/alpha image into a Motif
       UIL icon file


SYNOPSIS
       pamtouil [-name=uilname] [pamfile]

       You may abbreviate any option  to  its  shortest  unique
       prefix.   You  may  use  two  hyphens  instead of one to
       delimit an option.  You may separate an option from  its
       value with whitespace instead of =.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamtouil  reads a PNM or PAM image as input and produces
       a Motif UIL icon file as output.  If the input  is  PAM,
       it  may  be either a regular grayscale or color image or
       grayscale+alpha or color+alpha.  Where the alpha channel
       is  present,  pamtouil renders pixels that are more than
       half transparent as transparent in the output.

       In the UIL's colormap, pamtouil  uses  the  color  names
       from  the  RGB database -- the same one ppmmake(1) uses.
       Where a color in the input does not exactly match one of
       the  colors named in the RGB database, pamtouil uses the
       closest color named in the RGB database.


OPTIONS
       -name       Allows you  to  specify  the  prefix  string
              which is printed in the
                   resulting  UIL  output.   If  not specified,
              will default to the filename
                   (without extension) of the ppmfile argument.
              If -name is not
                   specified  and no ppmfile is specified (i.e.
              piped input), the
                   prefix string will  default  to  the  string
              'noname'.

HISTORY
       Before May 2002, pamtouil was called ppmtouil and had no
       way to specify transparency.
