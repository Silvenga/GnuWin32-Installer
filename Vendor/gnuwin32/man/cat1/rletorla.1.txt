RLETORLA(1)                                         RLETORLA(1)





NAME
       rletorla  -  convert  a Utah RLE image file into a Wave-
       front "rla" or "rlb" image file.

SYNOPSIS
       rletorla [ -b ] [ -h ] [ -v ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program converts Utah RLE(5) image files into Wave-
       front  "rla" or "rlb" image files.  Rletorla will handle
       four types of RLE files: Grayscale (8 bit data, no color
       map),  Pseudocolor  (8 bit data with a color map), True-
       color (24 bit data with color map), and Directcolor  (24
       bit  data,  no  color  map).  In each case the resulting
       Wavefront image file will contain RGB data as well as  a
       matte  channel.  If no alpha channel is found in the RLE
       file, the Wavefront matte channel will be computed using
       the  RGB  or  mapped data.  The entire area of the Wave-
       front image will be run length encoded.  The size of the
       Wavefront  "bounding  box" data structure will be set to
       that of the total image area.

       NOTE:  Even though images of any size can be  converted,
       Wavefront  is  very  fussy about image dimensions.  Nor-
       mally, the converted image must be one of the  following
       sizes  or  Wavefront  will  complain with "ERROR, cannot
       open image file filename, error -8":

       646x485 (0-645x0-484) ntsc_4d
       720x486 (0-719x0-485) qtl_ntsc
       636x484 (0-635x0-483) iris_ntsc
       1024x1024 (0-1023x0-1023) 1k_square

       To get around this problem, the aspect  ratio  field  in
       the  Wavefront "rla" file will be "faked" with "ntsc_4d"
       for all formats that do not match  one  of  those  shown
       above.   This  way,  Wavefront  will find a valid format
       string, and any image  size  will  be  readable.   "rlb"
       image file do not have this limitation.

OPTIONS
       -b     This option will cause rletorla to create a Wave-
              front "rlb"  image  file  instead  of  using  the
              default "rla" conversion.

       -v     This  option  will  cause  rletorla to operate in
              verbose mode.  Header information is  printed  to
              "stderr".

       -h     This  option allows the header of the RLE file to
              be dumped  to  "stderr"  without  converting  the
              file.   It  is  equivalent to using the -v option
              except that no file conversion takes place.

       -o outfile
              This option allows the name of the output file to
              be specified.  Re-directing standard output as is
              done with most all other toolkit utilities is not
              permitted  here  because  the  resulting "rla" or
              "rlb" file is not written sequentially.

       infile The name of the RLE image data file  to  be  con-
              verted.  The name of the resulting Wavefront file
              will be derived from the name of the  input  file
              (unless  the  -o option is used) -- the extension
              will be changed from "rle"  to  "rla"  or  "rlb".
              (Note:  if  you use the extended input file names
              described in urt(1), this will result in  a  very
              strange filename for the Wavefront file.)

EXAMPLES
       rletorla -v lenna.rle
              While  running in verbose mode, convert lenna.rle
              to Wavefront rla format and store resulting  data
              in lenna.rla.

       rletorla -h test.0001.rle
              Dump  the  header  information  of  the  RLE file
              called test.0001.rle.

       rletorla -b -o junk.rlb test.rle
              Convert test.rle  into  a  Wavefront  "rlb"  file
              called junk.rlb.
