SYNOPSIS
       unrtf [options] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  program  unrtf is a converter from Rich Text Format
       (RTF) to  a  growing  number  of  document  formats.  At
       present  it  supports  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),
       plain text, text with  VT100  codes,  LaTeX,  and  Post-
       Script.  All output formats except HTML are "alpha" i.e.
       limited and development has just  begun.   However  with
       HTML,  the  program  supports  tables,  fonts,  embedded
       images, hyperlinks, and paragraph alignment.  Font  sup-
       port  includes face and size changes, as well as typical
       attributes   such   as   italic,   bold,    underlining,
       strikethrough,  smallcaps, allcaps, expand, compress and
       both  foreground  and  background  colors.   Images  are
       always  stored  to  separate files in the current direc-
       tory, or they can be ignored.

OPTIONS
       --nopict
              disables the automatic storing of  embedded  pic-
              tures to the current directory.

       --html selects HTML output (default).

       --text selects plain ASCII text output.

       --vt   selects text output with VT100 escape codes.

       --latex
              selects output of a LaTeX document.

       --ps   selects PostScript output.
