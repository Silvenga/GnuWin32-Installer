NAME
       pktopbm - convert packed (PK) format font into PBM


SYNOPSIS
       pktopbm  pkfile[.pk] [ -x width ] [ -y height ] [-c num]
       pbmfile ...


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pktopbm reads a packed (PK) font file as input, and pro-
       duces  PBM images as output. If the filename '-' is used
       for any of the filenames, the standard input stream  (or
       standard  output  where  appropriate)  will  be used. If
       either the width or height is specified, this value will
       be  used  for  all bitmaps produced. Also if one or both
       values are specified, the bitmap will be relocated  with
       the  hoffset  and voffset given in the pkfile. The base-
       point will be placed in the lower  left  corner  of  the
       bitmap  if  the bitmap is bigger than the specified size
       it will be truncated at the top or right.


OPTIONS
       -c num Sets the character  number  of  the  next  bitmap
              written to num.


       -x width
              Sets the width of the image in columns.


       -y width
              Sets the height of the image in rows.
