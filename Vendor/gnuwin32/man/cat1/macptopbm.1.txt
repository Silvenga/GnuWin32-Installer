NAME
       macptopbm - convert a MacPaint file into a PBM image


SYNOPSIS
       macptopbm [-extraskip N] [macpfile]

       You  can  abbreviate  any  option to its shortest unique
       prefix.


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       macptopbmreads a MacPaint file as input and  produces  a
       PBM image as output.


OPTIONS
       -extraskip
              This  flag  is  to get around a problem with some
              methods of transferring files from the Mac  world
              to  the  Unix world.  Most of these methods leave
              the Mac files alone, but a few of  them  add  the
              'finderinfo'  data  onto  the  front  of the Unix
              file.  This means an extra 128 bytes to skip over
              when  reading the file.  The symptom to watch for
              is that the resulting PBM file looks  shifted  to
              one  side.   If you get this, try -extraskip 128,
              and if that still doesn't look right try  another
              value.
