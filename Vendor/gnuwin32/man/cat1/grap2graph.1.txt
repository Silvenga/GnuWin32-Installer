GRAP2GRAPH(1)                                     GRAP2GRAPH(1)



NAME
       grap2graph  - convert a grap diagram into a cropped bit-
       map image

SYNOPSIS
       grap2graph [ -unsafe ] [  -resolution M|MxN  ]  [  -for-
       mat fmt ]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  grap  program as input; produces an image file
       (by default in Portable Network Graphics  format)  suit-
       able  for  the  Web as output.  For a description of the
       grap language, see grap(1).

       Your graph specification should not be wrapped with  the
       .G1  and  .G2  macros  that  normally  guard  it  within
       groff(1) macros.

       The  output  image  will  be  a  black-on-white  graphic
       clipped  to the smallest possible bounding box that con-
       tains all the black pixels.  By specifying  command-line
       options  to  be  passed  to convert(1) you can give it a
       border, set the background transparent, set the  image's
       pixel  density, or perform other useful transformations.

       This program uses grap(1),  pic(1),  groff(1),  and  the
       ImageMagick  convert(1) program.  These programs must be
       installed on your system and accessible  on  your  $PATH
       for grap2graph to work.

OPTIONS
       -unsafe
              Run  pic(1)  and  groff(1)  in  the `unsafe' mode
              enabling the PIC macro sh  to  execute  arbitrary
              commands.  The default is to forbid this.

       -format fmt
              Specify  an  output  format;  the  default is PNG
              (Portable Network  Graphics).   Any  format  that
              convert(1) can emit is supported.

       Command-line switches and arguments not listed above are
       passed to convert(1).

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_TMPDIR
              The directory in which temporary  files  will  be
              created.   If this is not set grap2graph searches
              the environment variables TMPDIR, TMP,  and  TEMP
              (in that order).  Otherwise, temporary files will
              be created in /tmp.

SEE ALSO
       pic2graph(1),  eqn2graph(1),  pic(1),  groff(1),  gs(1),
       convert(1).
