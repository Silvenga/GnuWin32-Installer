NAME
       compface,  uncompface - compress and expand 48x48x1 face
       image files

SYNOPSIS
       compface [ infile [ outfile ] ] ...

       uncompface [-X] [ infile [ outfile ] ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       compface is a filter for  generating  highly  compressed
       representations of 48x48x1 face image files.  uncompface
       is an inverse filter which performs an inverse transfor-
       mation  with  no  loss  of  data.  The algorithm used is
       highly tuned for its purpose and achieves better than  a
       five  to  one  compression  ratio on average.  Arguments
       operate identically  for  both  programmes.   The  first
       argument,  if present, causes input to be taken from the
       named file instead of from standard input unless  it  is
       the string ``-''.  A second argument, if present, causes
       output to go to the named file instead  of  to  standard
       output  unless it is the string ``-''.  Subsequent pairs
       of arguments may be used to  specify  further  pairs  of
       input and output files.

       The input format for compface (and the output format for
       uncompface) is 48 lines each of 3 sixteen bit  hexadeci-
       mal  integers,  comma terminated in C initialiser style.
       The output format of compface (and the input format  for
       uncompface)  is  some number of lines made up of a space
       followed by printable characters (in the range ``!''  to
       ``~'' inclusive).  The first line contains 72 characters
       and following lines contain 79  characters  except  that
       the last line may be short.

       If  the  -X  option is given to uncompface, it generates
       XBM format directly.

       The amount of compression obtained varies  between  face
       image  files  but  the  output of compface averages less
       than 200 characters.  The average number of output lines
       is three.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit  status  is normally 0.  Possible errors include IO
       errors when opening, reading or  writing  files,  format
       errors  in  compface  input files and invalid arguments.
       Each results in an explanatory message on standard error
       and  an exit status of 1.  A warning will be produced if
       compface detects extra input data.

BUGS
       Nominating standard input as input more than  once  does
       not work.
