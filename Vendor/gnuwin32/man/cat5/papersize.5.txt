PAPERSIZE(5)                                                      PAPERSIZE(5)



NAME
       papersize - specify preferred paper size

SYNOPSYS
       ${prefix}/etc/papersize

DESCRIPTION
       The  papersize  file  is  used  to specify the preferred
       paper size to use by  available  commands  and  programs
       generating documents.

       The  format of this file is extremely simple: whitespace
       and anything starting with `#' is ignored, and the  name
       of  the paper is the first string found; the case in the
       name of the paper does not import (see  CAVEATS  section
       however).

PAPER NAMES
       The following names are commonly understood by programs:
       a3, a4, a5,  b5,  letter,  legal,  executive,  note  and
       11x17.

       Additional  paper  names that one may encounter are: a0,
       a1, a2, a6, a7,  a8,  a9,  a10,  b0,  b1,  b2,  b3,  b4,
       tabloid,  statement,  note,  halfletter,  halfexecutive,
       folio,  quarto,  ledger,  archA,  archB,  archC,  archD,
       archE, flsa, flse, csheet, dsheet, esheet and 10x14.

       The  value  of  the  papersize file can be overrideen by
       looking in order at the PAPERSIZE environment  variable,
       then at the contents of the file specified by the PAPER-
       CONF environment variable.  If the papersize  file  does
       not  exist,  programs using the paper library default to
       using letter as a fall-back value

CAVEATS
       This manual page documents the format of  the  papersize
       file  that  is  read by the libpaper library.  Some pro-
       grams that read this file do not yet use the library and
       may have trouble ignoring whitespace and comments in the
       file; they may also require that the paper names  use  a
       specific capitalization.
