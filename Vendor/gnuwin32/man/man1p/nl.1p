.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fInl\fP utility shall read lines from the named \fIfile\fP or
the standard input if no \fIfile\fP is named and shall
reproduce the lines to standard output. Lines shall be numbered on
the left. Additional functionality may be provided in accordance
with the command options in effect.
.LP
The \fInl\fP utility views the text it reads in terms of logical pages.
Line numbering shall be reset at the start of each
logical page. A logical page consists of a header, a body, and a footer
section. Empty sections are valid. Different line numbering
options are independently available for header, body, and footer (for
example, no numbering of header and footer lines while
numbering blank lines only in the body).
.LP
The starts of logical page sections shall be signaled by input lines
containing nothing but the following delimiter
characters:
.TS C
center;l l l l l l l l.
\fBLine\fP 	 \fBStart of\fP 	
\\:\\:\\: 	 Header 	
\\:\\: 	 Body 	
\\: 	 Footer 	
.TE
.LP
Unless otherwise specified, \fInl\fP shall assume the text being read
is in a single logical page body.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fInl\fP utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
Only one file can be named.
.LP
The following options shall be supported:
.TP
\fB-b\0\fP \fItype\fP
Specify which logical page body lines shall be numbered. Recognized
\fItypes\fP and their meaning are: 
.TP
\fBa\fP
Number all lines.
.TP
\fBt\fP
Number only non-empty lines.
.TP
\fBn\fP
No line numbering.
.TP
\fBp\fP\fIstring\fP
Number only lines that contain the basic regular expression specified
in \fIstring\fP.
.sp
.LP
The default \fItype\fP for logical page body shall be \fBt\fP (text
lines numbered).
.TP
\fB-d\0\fP \fIdelim\fP
Specify the delimiter characters that indicate the start of a logical
page section. These can be changed from the default
characters \fB"\\:"\fP to two user-specified characters. If only one
character is entered, the second character shall remain the
default character \fB':'\fP .
.TP
\fB-f\0\fP \fItype\fP
Specify the same as \fBb\fP \fItype\fP except for footer. The default
for logical page footer shall be \fBn\fP (no lines
numbered).
.TP
\fB-h\0\fP \fItype\fP
Specify the same as \fBb\fP \fItype\fP except for header. The default
\fItype\fP for logical page header shall be \fBn\fP
(no lines numbered).
.TP
\fB-i\0\fP \fIincr\fP
Specify the increment value used to number logical page lines. The
default shall be 1.
.TP
\fB-l\0\fP \fInum\fP
Specify the number of blank lines to be considered as one. For example,
\fB-l\02\fP results in only the second adjacent
blank line being numbered (if the appropriate \fB-h\0a\fP, \fB-b\0a\fP,
or \fB-f\0a\fP option is set). The default
shall be 1.
.TP
\fB-n\0\fP \fIformat\fP
Specify the line numbering format. Recognized values are: \fBln\fP,
left justified, leading zeros suppressed; \fBrn\fP, right
justified, leading zeros suppressed; \fBrz\fP, right justified, leading
zeros kept. The default \fIformat\fP shall be \fBrn\fP
(right justified).
.TP
\fB-p\fP
Specify that numbering should not be restarted at logical page delimiters.
.TP
\fB-s\0\fP \fIsep\fP
Specify the characters used in separating the line number and the
corresponding text line. The default \fIsep\fP shall be a
<tab>.
.TP
\fB-v\0\fP \fIstartnum\fP
Specify the initial value used to number logical page lines. The default
shall be 1.
.TP
\fB-w\0\fP \fIwidth\fP
Specify the number of characters to be used for the line number. The
default \fIwidth\fP shall be 6.
.sp
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operand shall be supported:
.TP
\fIfile\fP
A pathname of a text file to be line-numbered.
.sp
.SH STDIN
.LP
The standard input is a text file that is used if no \fIfile\fP operand
is given.
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
The input file named by the \fIfile\fP operand is a text file.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fInl\fP:
.TP
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.TP
\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP
\fILC_COLLATE\fP
.sp
Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges, equivalence classes,
and multi-character collating elements within regular
expressions.
.TP
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files), the
behavior of character classes within regular expressions, and
for deciding which characters are in character class \fBgraph\fP (for
the \fB-b\0t\fP, \fB-f\0t\fP, and \fB-h\0t\fP
options).
.TP
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
.TP
\fINLSPATH\fP
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of \fILC_MESSAGES
\&.\fP
.sp
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP
Default.
.SH STDOUT
.LP
The standard output shall be a text file in the following format:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"%s%s%s", <\fP\fIline number\fP\fB>, <\fP\fIseparator\fP\fB>, <\fP\fIinput line\fP\fB>
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
where <\fIline\0number\fP> is one of the following numeric formats:
.TP
\fB%6d\fP
When the \fBrn\fP format is used (the default; see \fB-n\fP).
.TP
\fB%06d\fP
When the \fBrz\fP format is used.
.TP
\fB%-6d\fP
When the \fBln\fP format is used.
.TP
<empty>
When line numbers are suppressed for a portion of the page; the <\fIseparator\fP>
is also suppressed.
.sp
.LP
In the preceding list, the number 6 is the default width; the \fB-w\fP
option can change this value.
.SH STDERR
.LP
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH OUTPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.LP
None.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values shall be returned:
.TP
\00
Successful completion.
.TP
>0
An error occurred.
.sp
.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.LP
Default.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
In using the \fB-d\fP \fIdelim\fP option, care should be taken to
escape characters that have special meaning to the command
interpreter.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The command:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBnl -v 10 -i 10 -d \\!+ file1
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
numbers \fIfile1\fP starting at line number 10 with an increment of
10. The logical page delimiter is \fB"!+"\fP . Note that
the \fB'!'\fP has to be escaped when using \fIcsh\fP as a command
interpreter because of its history substitution syntax. For
\fIksh\fP and \fIsh\fP the escape is not necessary, but does not do
any harm.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
