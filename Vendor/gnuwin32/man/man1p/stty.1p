.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIstty\fP utility shall set or report on terminal I/O characteristics
for the device that is its standard input. Without
options or operands specified, it shall report the settings of certain
characteristics, usually those that differ from
implementation-defined defaults. Otherwise, it shall modify the terminal
state according to the specified operands. Detailed
information about the modes listed in the first five groups below
are described in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001, Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface. Operands
in the Combination Modes group (see Combination Modes ) are implemented
using operands in the
previous groups. Some combinations of operands are mutually-exclusive
on some terminal types; the results of using such
combinations are unspecified.
.LP
Typical implementations of this utility require a communications line
configured to use the \fBtermios\fP interface defined in
the System Interfaces volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001. On systems
where none of these lines are available, and on lines
not currently configured to support the \fBtermios\fP interface, some
of the operands need not affect terminal
characteristics.
.SH OPTIONS

.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fB-g\fP flag is designed to facilitate the saving and restoring
of terminal state from the shell level. For example, a
program may:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsaveterm="$(stty -g)"       # save terminal state
stty\fP \fI(new settings)\fP \fB        # set new state
\&...                         # ...
stty $saveterm              # restore terminal state
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Since the format is unspecified, the saved value is not portable across
systems.
.LP
Since the \fB-a\fP format is so loosely specified, scripts that save
and restore terminal settings should use the \fB-g\fP
option.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The original \fIstty\fP description was taken directly from System
V and reflected the System V terminal driver \fBtermio\fP.
It has been modified to correspond to the terminal driver \fBtermios\fP.
.LP
Output modes are specified only for XSI-conformant systems. All implementations
are expected to provide \fIstty\fP operands
corresponding to all of the output modes they support.
.LP
The \fIstty\fP utility is primarily used to tailor the user interface
of the terminal, such as selecting the preferred ERASE
and KILL characters. As an application programming utility, \fIstty\fP
can be used within shell scripts to alter the terminal
settings for the duration of the script.
.LP
The \fBtermios\fP section states that individual disabling of control
characters is possible through the option
_POSIX_VDISABLE. If enabled, two conventions currently exist for specifying
this: System V uses \fB"^-"\fP , and BSD uses
\fIundef\fP. Both are accepted by \fIstty\fP in this volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001.
The other BSD convention of using
the letter \fB'u'\fP was rejected because it conflicts with the actual
letter \fB'u'\fP , which is an acceptable value for a
control character.
.LP
Early proposals did not specify the mapping of \fB"^c"\fP to control
characters because the control characters were not
specified in the POSIX locale character set description file requirements.
The control character set is now specified in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001, Chapter 3, Definitions
so the
historical mapping is specified. Note that although the mapping corresponds
to control-character key assignments on many terminals
that use the ISO/IEC\0646:1991 standard (or ASCII) character encodings,
the mapping specified here is to the control
characters, not their keyboard encodings.
.LP
Since \fBtermios\fP supports separate speeds for input and output,
two new options were added to specify each distinctly.
.LP
Some historical implementations use standard input to get and set
terminal characteristics; others use standard output. Since
input from a login TTY is usually restricted to the owner while output
to a TTY is frequently open to anyone, using standard input
provides fewer chances of accidentally (or maliciously) altering the
terminal settings of other users. Using standard input also
allows \fIstty\fP \fB-a\fP and \fIstty\fP \fB-g\fP output to be redirected
for later use. Therefore, usage of standard input is
required by this volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001.
