\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
This utility is typically used in shell scripts, as shown in the EXAMPLES
section. The special built-in utility \fB:\fP is
sometimes more efficient than \fItrue\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
This command is executed forever:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBwhile true
do
    command
done
\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fItrue\fP utility has been retained in this volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001,
even though the shell special
built-in \fB:\fP provides similar functionality, because \fItrue\fP
is widely used in historical scripts and is less cryptic to
novice script readers.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
