.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIjoin\fP utility shall perform an equality join on the files
\fIfile1\fP and \fIfile2\fP. The joined files shall be
written to the standard output.
.LP
The join field is a field in each file on which the files are compared.
The \fIjoin\fP utility shall write one line in the
output for each pair of lines in \fIfile1\fP and \fIfile2\fP that
have identical join fields. The output line by default shall
consist of the join field, then the remaining fields from \fIfile1\fP,
then the remaining fields from \fIfile2\fP. This format
can be changed by using the \fB-o\fP option (see below). The \fB-a\fP
option can be used to add unmatched lines to the output.
The \fB-v\fP option can be used to output only unmatched lines.
.LP
The files \fIfile1\fP and \fIfile2\fP shall be ordered in the collating
sequence of \fIsort\fP \fB-b\fP on the fields on which they shall
be joined, by default the first in each line.
All selected output shall be written in the same collating sequence.
.LP
The default input field separators shall be <blank>s. In this case,
multiple separators shall count as one field
separator, and leading separators shall be ignored. The default output
field separator shall be a <space>.
.LP
The field separator and collating sequence can be changed by using
the \fB-t\fP option (see below).
.LP
If the same key appears more than once in either file, all combinations
of the set of remaining fields in \fIfile1\fP and the
set of remaining fields in \fIfile2\fP are output in the order of
the lines encountered.
.LP
If the input files are not in the appropriate collating sequence,
the results are unspecified.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fIjoin\fP utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
.LP
The following options shall be supported:
.TP
\fB-a\0\fP \fIfile_number\fP
.sp
Produce a line for each unpairable line in file \fIfile_number\fP,
where \fIfile_number\fP is 1 or 2, in addition to the default
output. If both \fB-a\fP1 and \fB-a\fP2 are specified, all unpairable
lines shall be output.
.TP
\fB-e\0\fP \fIstring\fP
Replace empty output fields in the list selected by \fB-o\fP with
the string \fIstring\fP.
.TP
\fB-o\0\fP \fIlist\fP
Construct the output line to comprise the fields specified in \fIlist\fP,
each element of which shall have one of the
following two forms: 
.in +5
.LP
\fIfile_number.field\fP, where \fIfile_number\fP is a file number
and \fIfield\fP is a decimal integer field number
.in -5
.in +5
.LP
0 (zero), representing the join field
.in -5
.LP
The elements of \fIlist\fP shall be either comma-separated or <blank>-separated,
as specified in Guideline 8 of the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility
Syntax
Guidelines. The fields specified by \fIlist\fP shall be written for
all selected output lines. Fields selected by \fIlist\fP
that do not appear in the input shall be treated as empty output fields.
(See the \fB-e\fP option.) Only specifically requested
fields shall be written. The application shall ensure that \fIlist\fP
is a single command line argument.
.TP
\fB-t\0\fP \fIchar\fP
Use character \fIchar\fP as a separator, for both input and output.
Every appearance of \fIchar\fP in a line shall be
significant. When this option is specified, the collating sequence
shall be the same as \fIsort\fP without the \fB-b\fP option.
.TP
\fB-v\0\fP \fIfile_number\fP
.sp
Instead of the default output, produce a line only for each unpairable
line in \fIfile_number\fP, where \fIfile_number\fP is 1 or
2. If both \fB-v\fP1 and \fB-v\fP2 are specified, all unpairable lines
shall be output.
.TP
\fB-1\0\fP \fIfield\fP
Join on the \fIfield\fPth field of file 1. Fields are decimal integers
starting with 1.
.TP
\fB-2\0\fP \fIfield\fP
Join on the \fIfield\fPth field of file 2. Fields are decimal integers
starting with 1.
.sp
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operands shall be supported:
.TP
\fIfile1\fP,\0\fIfile2\fP
A pathname of a file to be joined. If either of the \fIfile1\fP or
\fIfile2\fP operands is \fB'-'\fP , the standard input
shall be used in its place.
.sp
.SH STDIN
.LP
The standard input shall be used only if the \fIfile1\fP or \fIfile2\fP
operand is \fB'-'\fP . See the INPUT FILES
section.
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
The input files shall be text files.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fIjoin\fP:
.TP
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.TP
\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP
\fILC_COLLATE\fP
.sp
Determine the locale of the collating sequence \fIjoin\fP expects
to have been used when the input files were sorted.
.TP
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
.TP
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
.TP
\fINLSPATH\fP
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of \fILC_MESSAGES
\&.\fP 
.sp
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP

.SH STDOUT
.LP
The \fIjoin\fP utility output shall be a concatenation of selected
character fields. When the \fB-o\fP option is not
specified, the output shall be:

    <\fP\fIother file2 fields\fP\fB>
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP

for that file shall be:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB<\fP\fIfields preceding join field\fP\fB>, <\fP\fIfields following join field\fP\fB>

.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fB-e\fP option is only effective when used with \fB-o\fP because,
unless specific fields are identified using \fB-o\fP,
\fIjoin\fP is not aware of what fields might be empty. The exception
to this is the join field, but identifying an empty join
field with the \fB-e\fP string is not historical practice and some
scripts might break if this were changed.
.LP
The 0 field in the \fB-o\fP list was adopted from the Tenth Edition
version of \fIjoin\fP to satisfy international objections
that the \fIjoin\fP in the base documents does not support the "full
join" or "outer join" described in relational database
literature. Although it has been possible to include a join field
in the output (by default, or by field number using \fB-o\fP),
the join field could not be included for an unpaired line selected
by \fB-a\fP. The \fB-o\fP 0 field essentially selects the
union of the join fields.
.LP
This sort of outer join was not possible with the \fIjoin\fP commands
in the base documents. The \fB-o\fP 0 field was chosen
because it is an upwards-compatible change for applications. An alternative
was considered: have the join field represent the union
of the fields in the files (where they are identical for matched lines,
and one or both are null for unmatched lines). This was not
adopted because it would break some historical applications.
.LP
The ability to specify \fIfile2\fP as \fB-\fP is not historical practice;
it was added for completeness.
.LP
The \fB-v\fP option is not historical practice, but was considered
necessary because it permitted the writing of \fIonly\fP
those lines that do not match on the join field, as opposed to the
\fB-a\fP option, which prints both lines that do and do not
match. This additional facility is parallel with the \fB-v\fP option
of \fIgrep\fP.
.LP
Some historical implementations have been encountered where a blank
line in one of the input files was considered to be the end
of the file; the description in this volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001
does not cite this as an allowable case.
