.SH NAME
izoom - magnify or shrink an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/usr/sbin/izoom\fP \fBinimage\fP \fBoutimage\fP \fBxscale\fP \fByscale\fP [-i -b -t -q -m or -g]
[-w blurfactor]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIizoom\fP magnifies or shrinks an image with or without filtering. xscale
and yscale are floating point scale factors. The filtering method is one
pass, uses 2-d convolution, and is optimized by integer arithmetic and
precomputation of filter coefficients. Normally \fIizoom\fP uses a triangle
filter kernel in both x and y directions.
The \fB-i\fP (impulse) option causes izoom to do no filtering as the image is
resized. The \fB-b\fP (box) option causes izoom to use a box as the filter
kernel. The \fB-t\fP (triangle) option is the default. The \fB-q\fP (quadratic)
option indicates that a quadratic function should be used as the filter
kernel. The \fB-m\fP option uses a Mitchell kernel and the \fB-g\fP option uses a
Gaussian kernel. The \fB-w\fP \fBblurfactor\fP option specifies the width of the
reconstruction filter. This will effect how blurry the resulting image
is. If you want more blur use a larger number. The default value is
1.0.
NOTE: \fIizoom\fP does not work on dithered images which are nothing more than
color look-up table indices. To perform any such image processing one
must first use something like \fIfromdi\fP (in the moregltools subsystem, and
also can be found in /\fIusr\fP/\fIpeople\fP/\fI4Dgifts\fP/\fIiristools\fP/\fIimgtools\fP/\fIfromdi\fP.\fIc\fP),
which converts the dithered image into an RGB image.
