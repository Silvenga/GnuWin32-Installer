.SH NAME
intro - introduction to games and demos
.SH DESCRIPTION
The manual pages with the section 6 suffix are for recreational and
educational programs normally found in the directory \fB/usr/games\fP; however,
Silicon Graphics currently does not ship any such programs, so this
directory does not exist.
The manual pages with the suffix 6D are the demonstration programs found
in the directory \fB/usr/demos/General_Demos,\fP \fB/usr/demos/O2\fP or
\fB/usr/demos/OCTANE\fP Beginning with the 6.3 release of IRIX, these demos can
be accessed from several mechanisms:
- from a web-based interface, which can be started using the toolchest
Find; Demos menu option
- from the system iconcatalog, which can be started using the toolchest
Find; Iconcatalog; Demos
- from buttonfly (/usr/demos/buttonfly)
- and directly from the directories /usr/demos/General_Demos,
/usr/demos/O2 and /usr/demos/OCTANE
Both buttonfly and the directory noted above can be accessed using the
Find; File QuickFind menu option or Selected; File QuickFind menu option
available from the system toolchest
The availability of these programs and the data they use will vary from
system to system and from release to release.
