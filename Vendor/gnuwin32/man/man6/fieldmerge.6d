.SH NAME
fieldmerge - merge two field images into one frame
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfieldmerge\fP \fBinimage0\fP \fBinimage1\fP \fBoutimage\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Standard NTSC Video displays 30 frames per second. Each frame is
composed of two fields that are interlaced. When recording video
animations it is sometimes good to record 60 fields per second, but to do
this two fields must be merged together into a single frame by
interleaving scanlines from two images. \fIfieldmerge\fP interleaves two images
in this way.
.SH NOTE
This program requires that all the source images on the command line have
the same x/y size.
