.SH NAME
fromdi - convert an old .di dithered image into an RGB image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfromdi\fP \fBcolors.map\fP \fBoutimage.rgb\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIfromdi\fP converts an old .di dithered (8-bits) image into an RGB image.
\fIipaste\fP works differently on 4D machines than it originally did on
2000/3000 IRIS machines. While it is true that on the 2000/3000 machines
image files made by the program dither (making an 8-bit image) would work
with \fIipaste\fP , on the 4D's \fIipaste\fP was written to operate on RGB (24-bit)
images or SCREEN (16-bit starting at zero) images but not with DITHERED
(8-bits starting at some offset) images. Refer to the Note in the
ipaste(1G) man page stating that if one REALLY wants to view their
DITHERED images on a 4D, they will first need to use \fIfromdi\fP to convert
them from DITHERED into RGB format, and then can use \fIipaste\fP to display
them.
