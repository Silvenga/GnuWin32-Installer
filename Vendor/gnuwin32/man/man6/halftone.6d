.SH NAME
halftone - half-tone an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBhalftone\fP \fBinimage\fP \fBoutimage\fP \fBfreq\fP \fBangle\fP \fB[patternno]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIhalftone\fP converts the input image into a halftoned image, using
Hollaway's technique. The density of the halftone screen is controlled
by the floating point value freq. Smaller values of \[lq]freq\[rq] make a larger
dot pattern. The angle of the halftone patterns is controlled by the
argument \[lq]angle\[rq]. The integer argument \[lq]patternno\[rq] selects the halftone
pattern. 0 is the default and creates a dot pattern. A pattern value of
1 will create a line screen, while 2, 3, 4, and 5 create other halftone
patterns.
