.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBscope\fP \fBinimage\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIscope\fP allows viewing an image of any size. This tool can be very useful
particularly with images larger than 1280x1024 pixels. The image appears
on the right hand side of the window, and a blowup of it is on the left
initially focused at the image's center. \[lq]xpos\[rq] and \[lq]ypos\[rq] indicate the
pixel location of the white square box, \[lq]color\[rq] gives the red, green, and
blue values at that location, and \[lq]zoom\[rq] indicates the zoom factor (its'
default is 10). By moving the mouse over the image on the right and
pressing LEFTMOUSE, you can change the window of focus on the right. The
up and down arrow keys zoom out and in respectively.
