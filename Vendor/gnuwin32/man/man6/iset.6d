.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/usr/sbin/iset\fP \fBnewtype\fP \fBimgfiles\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIiset\fP sets the type of an image. This determines which part of the color
map ipaste uses to display the image. The four types of viewable images
are NORMAL, DITHERED, SCREEN, and COLORMAP. These are the four values
newtype can have (each must be spelled in all capital letters as above).
A NORMAL image is an RGB or monochrome image.
A DITHERED image is a color image using only 8 bits to represent the
original 24-bit true RGB image. This image type is obsolete on 4D
machines.
A SCREEN image contains color indexes.
A COLORMAP image is used to store colormaps.
