.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBblur\fP \fBinimage\fP \fBoutimage\fP \fB[pix]\fP \fBor\fP \fB[xpix\fP \fBypix]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIblur\fP low pass filters the input image. This is done by izooming the
image down and then izooming it back up with filtering. The amount of
blurring is controlled by pix or xpix and ypix. A pix value of 10 will
cause the blur to zoom the image down until it is about 10 pixels across,
and then zoom it back up to the original size. Large pix values end up
making the result less blurry.
