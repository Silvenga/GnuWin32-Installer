.SH NAME
btree - display an image using a binary tree ordering.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbtree\fP \fBinimage\fP \fB[depth]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIbtree\fP displays an image using a progressive technique. First it is drawn
as a 2 by 2 array of rectangles, then rectangles are added to make it a 4
by 4 array. The resolution is increased in this way to the default level
which is depth 8. To manually set the level of resolution to be other
than 8, specify depth as some integer value.
