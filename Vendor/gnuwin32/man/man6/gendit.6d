argument nr selects how many levels or red to use, while ng, and nb
select the number of green and blue levels respectively. The minimum
value for nr, ng, or nb is 2. The total number of colors used will be
nr*ng*nb. The \[lq]-s\[rq] option is used to offset the dither patterns used for
red, green and blue by 2 pixels.
