.SH NAME
totarga - Convert from an IRIS image to a type 2 (RGB) targa image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtotarga\fP \fBinimage.rgb\fP \fBoutimage.tga\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fItotarga\fP converts from an IRIS image to a type 2 (RGB) targa image. Most
targa images are displayed directly on monitors with no gamma correction.
The typical gamma is about 2.2, so you need to gammawarp the input image
by 0.454545 to get it out of the linear intensity space, and into monitor
space before using totarga.
