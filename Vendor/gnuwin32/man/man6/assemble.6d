.SH NAME
assemble - assemble an array of smaller images
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBassemble\fP \fBnx\fP \fBny\fP \fBoutimage\fP \fBimgfiles...\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIassemble\fP assembles an nx by ny array of smaller images. The catch here
is that all images being assembled have to have the same x/y dimensions.
The nx by ny array works like this: nx is the number of images that are
going to be sitting side by side in the horizontal direction, and ny is
the number of images side by side in the vertical direction. Order
imgfiles so that the first image will be the one sitting in the bottom
left-hand corner of outimage, with the second sitting either above it or
to its right. If fewer than nx times ny images are given on the command
line, the last image is used repeatedly.
