.SH NAME
bgpaste - paste an image onto the root window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbgpaste\fP \fB[-t\fP \fBr\fP \fBg\fP \fBb]\fP \fB[-o\fP \fBxorig\fP \fByorig]\fP \fBinimage\fP
\fBbgpaste\fP \fB[-t\fP \fBr\fP \fBg\fP \fBb]\fP \fB-n\fP \fBnumimgs\fP \fBxorg\fP \fByorg\fP \fBimg\fP \fB[xorg\fP \fByorg\fP \fBimg\fP \fB.\fP \fB.\fP \fB.\fP \fB]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIbgpaste\fP works in one of two distinct ways: either feed it one image,
which by default is automatically centered (or explicitly specify the
image's origin), or feed it a list of one or more images preceeded by
their respective x/y origins to be painted as a composite in the root
window.
In the first case, \fIbgpaste\fP centers and pastes inimage onto the root
window regardless of inimage's size.
You can override the \[lq]centering\[rq] default and explicitly position your own
image manually by using the -\fIo\fP option to specify the image's absolute-
screenspace origin as measured from the bottom-left corner of the
graphics display screen. The \fIxorig\fP,\fIyorig\fP pair is defined in terms of the
image's bottom-left corner. Negative values are legal to specify and
will \[lq]plant\[rq] the image's origin offscreen to the left and/or the bottom
of the screen origin.
In the second case, the -\fIn\fP flag tells \fIbgpaste\fP you are including a list of
\fIn\fP images, where each image is preceeded by its respective x/y origin pair
(again, negative values are legal). The intersection of the composite
set of images with that of the root window size is calculated and a
buffer of that size is allocated which will contain the composite. The
images will be painted in the order enumerated: the first image listed
will be painted first, the last will be painted last. Any \[lq]background\[rq]
within the composite, as well as any remaining area of the root window
not included in the intersection, will be painted with the default gray
color or one defined using the -\fIt\fP flag.
In either of the above descriptions, if either the X or the Y size (or
both) of inimage/composite is smaller than the screen size, a gray
background is painted where the image/composite doesn't appear. This
gray default color can be redefined to be a specific RGB triplet using
the -\fIt\fP option followed by the \fIr\fP \fIg\fP \fIb\fP integer triplet. Use izoom(6D) if
you wish to blowup an inmage that is smaller than the screen's X and/or Y
size.
.SH NOTE
When employing \fIbgpaste\fP -\fIn\fP performance will degrade because of the
creation of the buffer which stores the composite root window image.
