.SH NAME
dotgen - make an image of two crossed sinusoidal wave patterns
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdotgen\fP \fBoutimage\fP \fBsize\fP \fBscalex\fP \fBscaley\fP \fB[-a]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIdotgen\fP generates an image of two crossed sinusoidal wave patterns. The
output image can be used as input to thresh to create halftoned images.
The output of \fIdotgen\fP is a square image size pixels on a side. scalex and
scaley are floating point values that can be used to change the density
and rotation of the dot pattern. If they are both integers, the output
image will match up with its self when it tiles the plane. The \fB-a\fP option
causes \fIdotgen\fP to take the absolute value of the sum of the two sinusoids.
