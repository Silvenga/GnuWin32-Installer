.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcscale\fP can be used to color balance an image by scaling the r, g, and b
channels by different factors. Each scale factor is an integer in the
range 0 to 255. A scale factor of 0 is interpreted to mean scale by 0.0,
while a scale factor of 255 means scale by 1.0. Each scale factor
multiplies a color channel of the source image. If the -d option is
given, the input colors are divided by the given factors.
