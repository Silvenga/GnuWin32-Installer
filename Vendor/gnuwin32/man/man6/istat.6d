.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIistat\fP prints the header information of a list of image files. x/ysize
give the image's screen size in pixels; zsize is the number of channels
in the image. An RGB image will typically have three channels, while a
Monochrome image will use one channel. Min and max are the range of pixel
intensity values in the image. Bpp describes how many bytes are stored in
each channel of the image; either 1 byte or 2 bytes. Type of image can
be NORMAL, DITHERED, SCREEN, or COLORMAP. Storage refers to the way the
data is compressed: rle is a run-length encoded image, verb is a
verbatim image which means the data is not compressed in any way.
