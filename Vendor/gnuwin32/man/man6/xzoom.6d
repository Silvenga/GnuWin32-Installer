.SH NAME
xzoom - magnify or minify an image in the x direction
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIxzoom\fP magnifies or minifies an image in the x direction with or without
filtering (xscale and yscale are floating point values). The filtering
method is one pass, uses 1-d convolution, and is optimized by integer
arithmetic and precomputation of filter coefficients. Normally xzoom
uses a triangle filter kernel in the x direction. The -\fIi\fP (impulse)
option causes xzoom to do no filtering as the image is resized. The -\fIb\fP
(box) option causes xzoom to use a box as the filter kernel. The -\fIt\fP
(triangle) option is the default. The -\fIm\fP (mitchell) option uses a cubic
filter kernel. The -\fIq\fP (quadratic) indicates that a quadradic function
should be used as the filter kernel.
