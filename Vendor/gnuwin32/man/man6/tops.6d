.SH DESCRIPTION
\fItops\fP converts an IRIS image file into Postscript. This program can
generate black and white or color PostScript. It can create binary as
well as ASCII PostScript. It also can generate encapsulated PostScript
with a preview image.
The \fB-l\fP specifies the halftone screen density to use in the output image.
The default is a 40 line per inch screen.
The \fB-a\fP option specifies the screen angle to use in the printed image.
The default is a 45 degree screen.
The \fB-p\fP option specifies how many pixels per inch the image printed at.
For instance, the IRIS screen pixel density is 98 pixels per inch. If
you want to print a part of the screen at actual size use an option \fB-p\fP
\fB98.0\fP.
The \fB-x\fP and \fB-y\fP options let you specify the x and y pixel densities
independently.
The \fB-b\fP option specifies how many bits to use when describing images. The
valid options are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The default is 8 bits per pixel giving
256 shades in a black and white image.
If the \fB-B\fP option is given, binary PostScript for the image is generated.
This makes the output file about half as big, but you should only use
this option if you know that the printer you are using can handle binary
PostScript data.
The \fB-t\fP option allows you to give a value that is used to scale the x and
y pixel densities given above. Values less than 1.0 will print a smaller
image.
Normally, tops scales the image to fit a 8.5 by 11.0 inch page. The \fB-m\fP
option option lets you describe how large the page is.
Normally, tops uses a standard dot screen. The \fB-h\fP option generates
PostScript that uses a line screen instead.
The \fB-o\fP option allows you to specify an origin for the image.
Normally, tops generates black and white PostScript. If the \fB-rgb\fP or the
\fB-RGB\fP option is given, then rgb color PostScript will be generated. The
only difference between these two options is whether 1 function is used
to read the image data, or 3 functions are used.
If the \fB-cmyk\fP or the \fB-CMYK\fP option is given, then cmyk color PostScript
will be generated. The only difference between these two options is
whether 1 function is used to read the image data, or 4 functions are
used.
The \fB-eps\fP option will cause Encapsulated PostScript to be generated, with
a preview bitmap. This option should be used if you want to include the
PostScript in a document.
The \fB-I\fP option will generate an Encapsulated PostScript image with a
preview bitmap, but only a low resolution version of the input image is
saved. This file can then be included into a document for position only.
Later the low resolution image can be replaced with high resolution image
data.
