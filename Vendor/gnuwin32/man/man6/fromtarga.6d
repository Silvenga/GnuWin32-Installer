.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfromtarga\fP \fBinimage.tga\fP \fBoutimage.rgb\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIfromtarga\fP converts a type 2 RGB TARGA image into an IRIS image. Most
targa images are displayed directly on monitors with no gamma
correction. The typical gamma is about 2.2, so you need to gammawarp the
output image by 2.2 to get it into a linear intensity space.
