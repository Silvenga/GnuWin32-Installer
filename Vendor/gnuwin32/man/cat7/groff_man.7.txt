GROFF_MAN(7)                                       GROFF_MAN(7)



NAME
       groff_man  - groff `man' macros to support generation of
       man pages

SYNOPSIS
       [options ...] [files ...] [options ...] [files ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The man macros used to generate  man  pages  with  groff
       were  written  by James Clark.  This document provides a
       brief summary of the use of each macro in that  package.

OPTIONS
       The  man  macros  understand  the following command line
       options (which define various registers).

       -rcR=1 This option (the default if in nroff  mode)  cre-
              ates a single, very long page instead of multiple
              pages.  Say -rcR=0 to disable it.

       -rC1   If more than one manual page is given on the com-
              mand  line, number the pages continuously, rather
              than starting each at 1.

       -rD1   Double-sided printing.  Footers for even and  odd
              pages are formatted differently.

       -rFT=dist
              Set distance of the footer relative to the bottom
              of the page if negative or relative to the top if
              positive.  The default is -0.5i.

       -rHY=flags
              Set  hyphenation flags.  Possible values are 1 to
              hyphenate without restrictions, 2 to not  hyphen-
              ate  the  last word on a page, 4 to not hyphenate
              the last two characters of a word, and 8  to  not
              hyphenate  the  first  two  characters of a word.
              These values are additive; the default is 14.

       -rIN=width
              Set body text indentation to width.  The  default
              is 7n for nroff, 7.2n for troff.  For nroff, this
              value should always be  an  integer  multiple  of
              unit `n' to get consistent indentation.

       -rLL=line-length
              Set  line  length.   If this option is not given,
              the line length is set to respect any  value  set
              by  a  prior  `.ll'  request,  (which  must be in
              effect when the `.TH' macro is invoked), if  this
              differs from the built-in default for the format-
              ter; otherwise it defaults to 78n in  nroff  mode
              and 6.5i in troff mode.

              Note  that the use of a `.ll' request to initial-
              ize the line length  is  supported  for  backward
              compatibility  with some versions of the man pro-
              gram; direct initialization of the `LL'  register
              should  always  be preferred to the use of such a
              request.  In particular, note  that  a  `.ll 65n'
              request   does  not  preserve  the  normal  nroff
              default line length, (the man default initializa-
              tion  to  78n  prevails), whereas, the `-rLL=65n'
              option, or  an  equivalent  `.nr LL 65n'  request
              preceding  the  use of the `TH' macro, does set a
              line length of 65n.

       -rLT=title-length
              Set title length.  If this option is  not  given,
              the title length defaults to the line length.

       -rPnnn Enumeration  of  pages start with nnn rather than
              with 1.

       -rSxx  Base document font size is xx points (xx  can  be
              10, 11, or 12) rather than 10 points.

       -rSN=width
              Set  sub-subheading  indentation  to  width.  The
              default is 3n.

       -rXnnn After page nnn, number pages as nnna, nnnb, nnnc,
              etc.  For example, the option `-rX2' produces the
              following page numbers: 1, 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, etc.

USAGE
       This section describes the available macros  for  manual
       pages.  For further customization, put additional macros
       and requests into the file  man.local  which  is  loaded
       immediately after the man package.

       .TH title section [extra1] [extra2] [extra3]
              Set  the  title  of the man page to title and the
              section to section, which must take  on  a  value
              between 1 and 8.  The value section may also have
              a string appended, e.g. `.pm', to indicate a spe-
              cific  subsection  of  the man pages.  Both title
              and section are positioned at the left and  right
              in  the  header line (with section in parentheses
              immediately appended to title.  extra1  is  posi-
              tioned  in the middle of the footer line.  extra2
              is positioned at the left in the footer line  (or
              at the left on even pages and at the right on odd
              pages  if  double-sided  printing   is   active).
              extra3 is centered in the header line.

              For  HTML  output,  headers  and footers are com-
              pletely suppressed.

              Additionally, this macro starts a new  page;  the
              new  line number is 1 again (except if the `-rC1'
              option is given on the command line) -- this fea-
              ture  is  intended  only  for formatting multiple
              man pages;  a  single  man  page  should  contain
              exactly  one  TH  macro  at  the beginning of the
              file.

       .SH [text for a heading]
              Set up an unnumbered section heading sticking out
              to  the  left.  Prints out all the text following
              SH up to the end of the line (or the text in  the
              next input line if there is no argument to SH) in
              bold face (or the font specified  by  the  string
              HF), one size larger than the base document size.
              Additionally, the left margin and the indentation
              for  the  following  text is reset to the default
              values.

       .SS [text for a heading]
              Set up a secondary, unnumbered  section  heading.
              Prints  out  all  the text following SS up to the
              end of the line (or the text in  the  next  input
              line  if there is no argument to SS) in bold face
              (or the font specified by the string HF), at  the
              same  size  as the base document size.  Addition-
              ally, the left margin and the indentation for the
              following text is reset to the default values.

       .TP [nnn]
              Set  up  an  indented  paragraph with label.  The
              indentation is set to nnn  if  that  argument  is
              supplied  (the  default  unit is `n' if omitted),
              otherwise it is set to the  previous  indentation
              value  specified  with  TP,  IP, or HP (or to the
              default value if none  of  them  have  been  used
              yet).

              The first input line of text following this macro
              is interpreted as a string to be  printed  flush-
              left,  as  it  is appropriate for a label.  It is
              not interpreted as part of a paragraph, so  there
              is  no  attempt  to fill the first line with text
              from the following input lines.  Nevertheless, if
              the  label  is not as wide as the indentation the
              paragraph starts at the same line (but indented),
              continuing  on the following lines.  If the label
              is wider than  the  indentation  the  descriptive
              part  of the paragraph begins on the line follow-
              ing the label, entirely indented.  Note that nei-
              ther font shape nor font size of the label is set
              to a default value; on the other hand,  the  rest
              of the text has default font settings.

              The  TP  macro is the macro used for the explana-
              tions you are just reading.

       .TQ    The TQ macro sets up header  continuation  for  a
              .TP  macro.  With it, you can stack up any number
              of labels (such as in a glossary, or list of com-
              mands)  before  beginning the indented paragraph.
              For an example, look just  past  the  next  para-
              graph.

              This  macro is not defined on legacy Unix systems
              running classic troff.  To be certain  your  page
              will be portable to those systems, copy its defi-
              nition from  the  an-ext.tmac  file  of  a  groff
              installation.

       .LP    .PP  .P  These macros are mutual aliases.  Any of
              them causes a line break at the current position,
              followed  by  a  vertical  space downwards by the
              amount specified by the PD macro.  The font  size
              and  shape  are  reset to the default value (nor-
              mally 10pt Roman).   Finally,  the  current  left
              margin and the indentation are restored.

       .IP [designator] [nnn]
              Set up an indented paragraph, using designator as
              a tag to mark its beginning.  The indentation  is
              set  to  nnn  if  that  argument is supplied (the
              default unit is `n' if omitted), otherwise it  is
              set  to  the previous indentation value specified
              with TP, IP, or HP (or to the  default  value  if
              none  of them have been used yet).  Font size and
              face of the paragraph (but  not  the  designator)
              are reset to its default values.

              To  start an indented paragraph with a particular
              indentation but without a  designator,  use  `""'
              (two doublequotes) as the second argument.

              For  example,  the  following paragraphs were all
              set up with  bullets  as  the  designator,  using
              `.IP \(bu 4'.   The whole block has been enclosed
              with `.RS' and `.RE' to set the left margin  tem-
              porarily to the current indentation value.

              ·   IP is one of the three macros used in the man
                  package to format lists.

              ·   HP is another.  This macro produces  a  para-
                  graph with a left hanging indentation.

              ·   TP  is another.  This macro produces an unin-
                  dented label followed by  an  indented  para-
                  graph.

       .HP [nnn]
              Set up a paragraph with hanging left indentation.
              The indentation is set to nnn if that argument is
              supplied  (the  default  unit is `n' if omitted),
              otherwise it is set to the  previous  indentation
              value  specified  with  TP,  IP, or HP (or to the
              default value if none  of  them  have  been  used
              yet).   Font  size  and  face  are  reset  to its
              default values.  The following  paragraph  illus-
              trates  the  effect  of  this  macro with hanging
              indentation set to 4 (enclosed by .RS and .RE  to
              set  the  left  margin temporarily to the current
              indentation):

              This is a paragraph following  an  invocation  of
                  the  HP macro.  As you can see, it produces a
                  paragraph where all lines but the  first  are
                  indented.

              Use  of  this  presentation-level macro is depre-
              cated.   While  it  is  universally  portable  to
              legacy Unix systems, a hanging indentation cannot
              be expressed naturally under HTML, and many HTML-
              based  manual  viewers  simply  interpret it as a
              starter for a normal paragraph.  Thus, any infor-
              mation  or  distinction you tried to express with
              the indentation may be lost.

       .RS [nnn]
              This macro moves the left margin to the right  by
              the value nnn if specified (default unit is `n');
              otherwise it is set to the  previous  indentation
              value  specified  with  TP,  IP, or HP (or to the
              default value if none  of  them  have  been  used
              yet).   The  indentation value is then set to the
              default.

              Calls to the RS macro can be nested.

       .RE [nnn]
              This macro moves the left margin  back  to  level
              nnn,  restoring  the previous left margin.  If no
              argument is given, it moves one level back.   The
              first  level  (i.e.,  no call to RS yet) has num-
              ber 1, and each call to RS  increases  the  level
              by 1.

       .EX    .EE  Example/End  Example.   After EX, filling is
              disabled and the font is set  to  constant-width.
              This  is useful for formatting code, command, and
              configuration-file  examples.    The   EE   macro
              restores the previous font.

              These  macros  are  defined on many (but not all)
              legacy Unix systems running classic troff.  To be
              certain  your page will be portable to those sys-
              tems, copy their definitions from the an-ext.tmac
              file of a groff installation.

       To  summarize,  the  following macros cause a line break
       with the insertion of vertical space (which  amount  can
       be  changed  with the PD macro): SH, SS, TP, TQ, LP (PP,
       P), IP, and HP.  The macros RS,  RE,  EX,  and  EE  also
       cause a break but no insertion of vertical space.

MACROS TO SET FONTS
       The  standard  font  is  Roman; the default text size is
       10 point.

       .SM [text]
              Causes the text on the same line or the  text  on
              the  next  input line to appear in a font that is
              one point size smaller than the default font.

       .SB [text]
              Causes the text on the same line or the  text  on
              the  next  input line to appear in boldface font,
              one point size smaller than the default font.

       .BI text
              Causes text on the same  line  to  appear  alter-
              nately in bold face and italic.  The text must be
              on the same line as the macro call.  Thus

                     .BI this "word and" that

              would cause `this' and `that' to appear  in  bold
              face, while `word and' appears in italics.

       .IB text
              Causes  text  to appear alternately in italic and
              bold face.  The text must be on the same line  as
              the macro call.

       .RI text
              Causes  text  on  the  same line to appear alter-
              nately in roman and italic.  The text must be  on
              the same line as the macro call.

       .IR text
              Causes  text  on  the  same line to appear alter-
              nately in italic and roman.  The text must be  on
              the same line as the macro call.

       .BR text
              Causes  text  on  the  same line to appear alter-
              nately in bold face and roman.  The text must  be
              on the same line as the macro call.

       .RB text
              Causes  text  on  the  same line to appear alter-
              nately in roman and bold face.  The text must  be
              on the same line as the macro call.

       .B [text]
              Causes  text  to appear in bold face.  If no text
              is present on the line where the macro is  called
              the  text  of the next input line appears in bold
              face.

       .I [text]
              Causes text to appear in italic.  If no  text  is
              present on the line where the macro is called the
              text of the next input line appears in italic.

MACROS TO DESCRIBE HYPERLINKS AND EMAIL ADDRESSES
       The following macros are not defined on legacy Unix sys-
       tems  running  classic  troff.   To be certain your page
       will be portable to those systems,  copy  their  defini-
       tions from the an-ext.tmac file of a groff installation.

       Using these macros helps ensure that you get  hyperlinks
       when  your manual page is rendered in a browser or other
       program that is Web-enabled.

       .UR URL
              .UE [punctuation] Wrap a World  Wide  Web  hyper-
              link.  The argument to UR is the URL; thereafter,
              lines until UE are collected and used as the link
              text.   Any argument to the UE macro is pasted to
              the end of the text.  On a device that is  not  a
              browser,

                     this  is  a  link  to .UR http://\:random-
                     site.org/\:fubar some random  site  .UE  ,
                     given as an example

              usually  displays  like  this: "this is a link to
              some random  site  <http://randomsite.org/fubar>,
              given as an example".

              The use of \: to insert hyphenless breakpoints is
              a groff extension and can be omitted.

       .MT address
              .ME [punctuation] Wrap  an  email  address.   The
              argument  of  MT  is the address; text following,
              until ME, is a name to  be  associated  with  the
              address.   Any argument to the ME macro is pasted
              to the end of the link text.  On a device that is
              not a browser,

                     contact  .UR  fred.foonly@\:fubar.net Fred
                     Foonly .UE for more information

              usually displays like this: "contact Fred  Foonly
              <fred.foonly@fubar.net> for more information".

              The use of \: to insert hyphenless breakpoints is
              a groff extension and can be omitted.

MACROS TO DESCRIBE COMMAND SYNOPSES
       The following macros are not defined on legacy Unix sys-
       tems  running  classic  troff.   To be certain your page
       will be portable to those systems,  copy  their  defini-
       tions from the an-ext.tmac file of a groff installation.

       These macros are a convenience for authors.   They  also
       assist  automated translation tools and help browsers in
       recognizing command synopses and treating  them  differ-
       ently from running text.

       .SY command
              Begin  synopsis.   Takes  a  single argument, the
              name of a command.  Text following, until  closed
              by YS, is set with a hanging indentation with the
              width of command plus a space.  This produces the
              traditional look of a Unix command synopsis.

       .OP key value
              Describe an optional command argument.  The argu-
              ments of this macro are set surrounded by  option
              braces in the default Roman font; the first argu-
              ment is printed with a bold face, while the  sec-
              ond argument is typeset as italic.

       .YS    This macro restores normal indentation at the end
              of a command synopsis.

       Here is a real example:

              .SY groff .OP \-abcegiklpstzCEGNRSUVXZ .OP \-d cs
              .OP  \-f  fam .OP \-F dir .OP \-I dir .OP \-K arg
              .OP \-L arg .OP \-m name .OP \-M dir .OP \-n  num
              .OP  \-o  list .OP \-P arg .OP \-r cn .OP \-T dev
              .OP \-w name .OP \-W name .RI [ file .IR  .\|.\|.
              ] .YS

       produces the following output:

              [file ...]

       If  necessary, you might use br requests to control line
       breaking.  You can insert plain text as well; this looks
       like   the   traditional  (unornamented)  syntax  for  a
       required command argument or filename.

MISCELLANEOUS
       The default indentation is 7.2n in troff mode and 7n  in
       nroff mode except for grohtml which ignores indentation.

       .DT    Set tabs every 0.5 inches.  Since this  macro  is
              always called during a TH request, it makes sense
              to call it only if the tab  positions  have  been
              changed.

              Use  of  this  presentation-level macro is depre-
              cated.  It translates poorly to HTML, under which
              exact  whitespace  control  and  tabbing  are not
              readily available.  Thus, information or distinc-
              tions that you use DT to express are likely to be
              lost.  If you feel tempted to use it, you  should
              probably    be    composing    a    table   using
              tbl(@MAN1DIR@) markup instead.

       .PD [nnn]
              Adjust the empty space before a new paragraph  or
              section.   The optional argument gives the amount
              of space (default unit is `v');  without  parame-
              ter,  the  value  is  reset  to its default value
              (1 line in nroff  mode,  0.4v  otherwise).   This
              affects  the  macros SH, SS, TP, LP (resp. PP and
              P), IP, and HP.

              Use of this presentation-level  macro  is  depre-
              cated.  It translates poorly to HTML, under which
              exact control of inter-paragraph spacing  is  not
              readily available.  Thus, information or distinc-
              tions that you use PD to express are likely to be
              lost.

       .AT [system [release]]
              Alter  the  footer  for  use with AT&T man pages.
              This command exists only for compatibility; don't
              use it.  See the groff info manual for more.

       .UC [version]
              Alter  the  footer  for  use  with BSD man pages.
              This command exists only for compatibility; don't
              use it.  See the groff info manual for more.

       .PT    Print  the header string.  Redefine this macro to
              get control of the header.

       .BT    Print the footer string.  Redefine this macro  to
              get control of the footer.

       The following strings are defined:

       \*S    Switch back to the default font size.

       \*R    The `registered' sign.

       \*(Tm  The `trademark' sign.

       \*(lq  \*(rq  Left  and  right  quote.  This is equal to
              `\(lq' and `\(rq', respectively.

       \*(HF  The typeface used to print headings and  subhead-
              ings.  The default is `B'.

       If  a  preprocessor  like  tbl  or eqn is needed, it has
       become usage to make the first line of the man page look
       like this:

              '\" word

       Note  the single space character after the double quote.
       word consists of letters for the  needed  preprocessors:
       `e'  for  eqn,  `r'  for refer, and `t' for tbl.  Modern
       implementations of the man program read this first  line
       and automatically call the right preprocessor(s).

PORTABILITY AND TROFF REQUESTS
       Since   the  man  macros  consist  of  groups  of  groff
       requests, one can, in principle,  supplement  the  func-
       tionality  of  the  man  macros  with  individual  groff
       requests where necessary.  See the groff info pages  for
       a complete reference of all requests.

       Note,  however,  that using raw troff requests is likely
       to make your page render  poorly  on  the  (increasingly
       common)  class of viewers that render it to HTML.  Troff
       requests make implicit  assumptions  about  things  like
       character and page sizes that may break in an HTML envi-
       ronment; also, many of these viewers don't interpret the
       full  troff vocabulary, a problem which can lead to por-
       tions of your text being silently dropped.

       For portability to modern viewers, it is best  to  write
       your  page  entirely  in  the requests described on this
       page.  Further, it is best to completely avoid those  we
       have described as `presentation-level' (HP, PD, and DT).

       The macros we have  described  as  extensions  (.EX/.EE,
       .SY/.OP/.YS,  .UR/.UE,  and .MT/.ME) should be used with
       caution, as they may not yet be built in to some  viewer
       that  is  important to your audience.  If in doubt, copy
       the implementation onto your page.

FILES
       man.tmac
              an.tmac  These  are   wrapper   files   to   call
              andoc.tmac.

       andoc.tmac
              Use  this file in case you don't know whether the
              man macros or the mdoc package  should  be  used.
              Multiple man pages (in either format) can be han-
              dled.

       an-old.tmac
              Most man macros are contained in this file.

       an-ext.tmac
              The extension macro  definitions  for  .SY,  .OP,
              .YS,  .TQ, .EX/.EE, .UR/.UE, and .MT/.ME are con-
              tained in this file.  It is  written  in  classic
              troff,  and  released  for  free  re-use, and not
              copylefted; manual page authors  concerned  about
              portability to legacy Unix systems are encouraged
              to copy these definitions into their  pages,  and
              maintainers   of  troff  or  its  workalikes  are
              encouraged to re-use them.

       man.local
              Local changes and customizations  should  be  put
              into this file.
