NAME
       groff - a short reference for the GNU roff language

DESCRIPTION
       The  name  groff  stands  for  GNU  roff and is the free
       implementation of the  roff  type-setting  system.   See
       roff(7)  for  a  survey  and the background of the groff
       system.

       This document gives only short descriptions of the  pre-
       defined  roff  language elements as used in groff.  Both
       the classical features and the groff extensions are pro-
       vided.

       Historically, the roff language was called troff.  groff
       is compatible with the  classical  system  and  provides
       proper  extensions.   So  in GNU, the terms roff, troff,
       and groff language could be used as  synonyms.   However
       troff  slightly  tends  to  refer  more to the classical
       aspects, whereas groff emphasizes  the  GNU  extensions,
       and roff is the general term for the language.

       This  file is only a short version of the complete docu-
       mentation that is found in the groff info(1) file, which
       contains more detailed, actual, and concise information.

       The general syntax for writing groff documents is  rela-
       tively easy, but writing extensions to the roff language
       can be a bit harder.

       The roff language is line-oriented.  There are only  two
       kinds  of lines, control lines and text lines.  The con-
       trol lines start with a control character, by default  a
       period  "."   or a single quote "'"; all other lines are
       text lines.

       Control lines represent commands, optionally with  argu-
       ments.   They  have  the  following syntax.  The leading
       control character can be followed  by  a  command  name;
       arguments,  if any, are separated by spaces (but not tab
       characters) from the command name and among  themselves,
       for example,

              .command_name arg1 arg2

       For  indentation,  any number of space or tab characters
       can be inserted between the  leading  control  character
       and  the command name, but the control character must be
       on the first position of the line.

       Text lines represent the parts that  is  printed.   They
       can  be  modified  by escape sequences, which are recog-
       nized by a leading backslash `\'.  These are in-line  or
       even  in-word formatting elements or functions.  Some of
       these take arguments separated  by  single  quotes  "'",
       others  are regulated by a length encoding introduced by
       an open parenthesis `(' or enclosed in brackets `['  and
       `]'.

       The  roff  language  provides  flexible  instruments for
       writing language extension, such as macros.  When inter-
       preting macro definitions, the roff system enters a spe-
       cial operating mode, called the copy mode.

       The copy mode behavior can be quite  tricky,  but  there
       are some rules that ensure a safe usage.

       1.     Printable  backslashes must be denoted as \e.  To
              be more precise, \e represents the current escape
              character.  To get a backslash glyph, use \(rs or
              \[rs].

       2.     Double all backslashes.

       3.     Begin all text lines with the special non-spacing
              character \&.

       This  does  not  produce the most efficient code, but it
       should work as a first measure.  For better  strategies,
       see the groff info file and groff_tmac(5).

       Reading  roff  source  files  is easier, just reduce all
       double backslashes to a single one in all macro  defini-
       tions.

GROFF ELEMENTS
       The roff language elements add formatting information to
       a text file.  The fundamental  elements  are  predefined
       commands  and variables that make roff a full-blown pro-
       gramming language.

       There are two kinds  of  roff  commands,  possibly  with
       arguments.   Requests are written on a line of their own
       starting with  a  dot  `.'  or  a  "'",  whereas  Escape
       sequences  are  in-line functions and in-word formatting
       elements starting with a backslash `\'.

       The user can define her own  formatting  commands  using
       the  de  request.  These commands are called macros, but
       they are used exactly like requests.  Macro packages are
       pre-defined  sets  of  macros  written in the groff lan-
       guage.   A  user's  possibilities   to   create   escape
       sequences  herself is very limited, only special charac-
       ters can be mapped.

       The groff language provides several kinds  of  variables
       with  different interfaces.  There are pre-defined vari-
       ables, but the user can  define  her  own  variables  as
       well.

       String  variables  store  character sequences.  They are
       set with the ds request and retrieved by the  \*  escape
       sequences.  Strings can have variables.

       Register  variables  can store numerical values, numbers
       with a scale unit, and occasionally string-like objects.
       They are set with the nr request and retrieved by the \n
       escape sequences.

       Environments allow the user to temporarily store  global
       formatting  parameters like line length, font size, etc.
       for later reuse.  This is done by the ev request.

       Fonts are identified either by a name or by an  internal
       number.  The current font is chosen by the ft request or
       by the \f escape sequences.   Each  device  has  special
       fonts,  but  the  following  fonts are available for all
       devices.  R is the standard font Roman.  B is  its  bold
       counterpart.   The italic font is called I and is avail-
       able everywhere, but on text devices it is displayed  as
       an  underlined  Roman  font.   For  the graphical output
       devices, there exist constant-width  pendants  of  these
       fonts, CR, CI, and CB.  On text devices, all glyphs have
       a constant width anyway.

       Glyphs are visual representation  forms  of  characters.
       In  groff, the distinction between those two elements is
       not always obvious (and a full discussion is beyond  the
       scope  of this man page).  A first approximation is that
       glyphs have a specific size and  colour  and  are  taken
       from  a specific font; they can't be modified any more -
       characters are the input, and glyphs are the output.  As
       soon  as an output line has been generated, it no longer
       contains characters but glyphs.  In this  man  page,  we
       use  either  `glyph'  or  `character',  whatever is more
       appropriate.

       Moreover, there are  some  advanced  roff  elements.   A
       diversion  stores  (formatted)  information into a macro
       for later usage.  A trap is a positional condition  like
       a  certain  number of lines from page top or in a diver-
       sion or in the input.  Some action can be prescribed  to
       be run automatically when the condition is met.

       More  detailed  information and examples can be found in
       the groff info file.

CONTROL CHARACTERS
       There is a small set of characters that have  a  special
       controlling task in certain conditions.

       .      A  dot is only special at the beginning of a line
              or after the condition in the  requests  if,  ie,
              el, and while.  There it is the control character
              that introduces a request (or macro).   The  spe-
              cial  behavior  can  be  delayed  by using the \.
              escape.  By using the  cc  request,  the  control
              character  can  be  set to a different character,
              making the dot `.' a non-special character.

              In all other positions, it just means a dot char-
              acter.  In text paragraphs, it is advantageous to
              start each sentence at a line of its own.

       '      The single quote has two controlling  tasks.   At
              the  beginning  of  a line and in the conditional
              requests it is the non-breaking  control  charac-
              ter.   That  means  that  it introduces a request
              like the dot, but with  the  additional  property
              that  this request doesn't cause a linebreak.  By
              using the c2 request, the non-break control char-
              acter can be set to a different character.

              As  a  second  task, it is the most commonly used
              argument  separator  in  some  functional  escape
              sequences (but any pair of characters not part of
              the argument do work).  In all  other  positions,
              it denotes the single quote or apostrophe charac-
              ter.  Groff provides a  printable  representation
              with the \(cq escape sequence.

       "      The  double quote is used to enclose arguments in
              macros (but not in requests and strings).  In the
              ds and as requests, a leading double quote in the
              argument is stripped off, making everything  else
              afterwards  the  string  to  be defined (enabling
              leading whitespace).  The escaped double quote \"
              introduces  a comment.  Otherwise, it is not spe-
              cial.  Groff provides a printable  representation
              with the \(dq escape sequence.

       \      The   backslash   usually  introduces  an  escape
              sequence  (this  can  be  changed  with  the   ec
              request).   A printed version of the escape char-
              acter is the \e escape; a backslash glyph can  be
              obtained by \(rs.

       (      The  open  parenthesis  is only special in escape
              sequences when  introducing  an  escape  name  or
              argument  consisting  of  exactly two characters.
              In groff, this behavior can be replaced by the []
              construct.

       [      The  opening  bracket  is  only  special in groff
              escape sequences; there it is used to introduce a
              long escape name or long escape argument.  Other-
              wise, it is non-special, e.g. in macro calls.

       ]      The closing bracket  is  only  special  in  groff
              escape  sequences;  there  it  terminates  a long
              escape name or long escape argument.   Otherwise,
              it is non-special.

       space  Space  characters are only functional characters.
              They separate the arguments in requests,  macros,
              and  strings,  and the words in text lines.  They
              are subject to groff's horizontal spacing  calcu-
              lations.   To  get  a defined space width, escape
              sequences like `\ ' (this is the escape character
              followed  by  a  space),  \|, \^, or \h should be
              used.

       newline
              In text paragraphs, newlines mostly  behave  like
              space  characters.   Continuation  lines  can  be
              specified by an escaped newline, i.e., by  speci-
              fying  a backslash `\' as the last character of a
              line.

       tab    If a tab character occurs during text the  inter-
              preter  makes  a horizontal jump to the next pre-
              defined tab position.  There is  a  sophisticated
              interface for handling tab positions.

NUMERICAL EXPRESSIONS
       A  numerical  value  is  a signed or unsigned integer or
       float with or without an appended scaling indicator.   A
       scaling  indicator is a one-character abbreviation for a
       unit of measurement.  A number  followed  by  a  scaling
       indicator signifies a size value.  By default, numerical
       values do not have a scaling indicator, i.e.,  they  are
       normal numbers.

       The  roff language defines the following scaling indica-
       tors.

              c         Centimeter
              i         Inch
              P         Pica = 1/6 inch
              p         Point = 1/72 inch
              m         Em = the font size in  points  (approx.
                        width of letter `m')
              M         100th of an Em
              n         En = Em/2
              u         Basic unit for actual output device
              v         Vertical  line  space  in  basic  units
                        scaled point = 1/sizescale of  a  point
                        (defined in font DESC file)
              f         Scale by 65536.

       Numerical  expressions are combinations of the numerical
       values defined above  with  the  following  arithmetical
       operators already defined in classical troff.

              +         Addition
              -         Subtraction
              *         Multiplication
              /         Division
              %         Modulo
              =         Equals
              ==        Equals
              <         Less than
              >         Greater than
              <=        Less or equal
              >=        Greater or equal
              &         Logical and
              :         Logical or
              !         Logical not
              (         Grouping of expressions
              )         Close current grouping

       Moreover, groff added the following operators for numer-
       ical expressions:

              e1>?e2    The maximum of e1 and e2.
              e1<?e2    The minimum of e1 and e2.
              (c;e)     Evaluate e using c as the default scal-
                        ing indicator.

       For details see the groff info file.

CONDITIONS
       Conditions  occur in tests raised by the if, ie, and the
       while requests.  The following table  characterizes  the
       different types of conditions.

              N         A numerical expression N yields true if
                        its value is greater than 0.
              !N        True if the value of I is 0.
              's1's2'   True  if  string  s1  is  identical  to
                        string s2.
              !'s1's2'  True  if  string s1 is not identical to
                        string s2.
              cch       True if there is a glyph ch  available.
              dname     True  if  there  is  a  string,  macro,
                        diversion, or request called name.
              e         Current page number is even.
              o         Current page number is odd.
              mname     True if there is a color called name.
              n         Formatter is nroff.
              rreg      True if there is a register named  reg.
              t         Formatter is troff.
              Ffont     True if there exists a font named font.
              Sstyle    True if a style named  style  has  been
                        registered.

REQUESTS
       This  section  provides a short reference for the prede-
       fined requests.  In groff, request,  macro,  and  string
       names can be arbitrarily long.  No bracketing or marking
       of long names is needed.

       Most requests take one or more arguments.  The arguments
       are  separated  by space characters (no tabs!); there is
       no inherent limit for their length or number.

       Some requests have optional arguments with  a  different
       behaviour.   Not all of these details are outlined here.
       Refer to the groff info file and groff_diff(7)  for  all
       details.

       In  the  following request specifications, most argument
       names were chosen to be descriptive.  Only the following
       denotations need clarification.

              c         denotes a single character.
              font      a  font either specified as a font name
                        or a font number.
              anything  all characters up to  the  end  of  the
                        line or within \{ and \}.
              n         is  a  numerical expression that evalu-
                        ates to an integer value.
              N         is an arbitrary  numerical  expression,
                        signed or unsigned.
              ±N        has  three  meanings  depending  on its
                        sign, described below.

       If an expression defined as ±N starts with  a  `+'  sign
       the  resulting  value  of  the expression is added to an
       already existing value inherent to the related  request,
       e.g.  adding  to  a  number register.  If the expression
       starts with a `-' the value of the  expression  is  sub-
       tracted from the request value.

       Without  a sign, N replaces the existing value directly.
       To assign a negative number either prepend 0 or  enclose
       the negative number in parentheses.

       Besides these standard groff requests,  there  might  be
       further  macro  calls.   They can originate from a macro
       package (see roff(7) for an overview)  or  from  a  pre-
       processor.

       Preprocessor  macros  are  easy  to be recognized.  They
       enclose their code into a pair of characteristic macros.

ESCAPE SEQUENCES
       Escape  sequences  are in-line language elements usually
       introduced by a backslash `\' and followed by an  escape
       name  and  sometimes by a required argument.  Input pro-
       cessing is continued directly after the escaped  charac-
       ter  or  the argument (without an intervening separation
       character).  So there must be a way to determine the end
       of the escape name and the end of the argument.

       This  is  done by enclosing names (escape name and argu-
       ments consisting of a variable name) by a pair of brack-
       ets  [name]  and  constant arguments (number expressions
       and characters) by apostrophes (ASCII 0x27)  like  'con-
       stant'.

       There  are abbreviations for short names.  Two-character
       escape names can be specified by an opening  parenthesis
       like  \(xy  or \*(xy without a closing counterpart.  And
       all one-character names different from the special char-
       acters  `['  and  `('  can  even  be specified without a
       marker, for example \nc or \$c.

       Constant arguments of length 1 can omit the marker apos-
       trophes, too, but there is no two-character analogue.

       While one-character escape sequences are mainly used for
       in-line functions and system related tasks, the two-let-
       ter  names  following the \( construct are glyphs prede-
       fined by the roff  system;  these  are  called  `Special
       Characters'  in  the  classical  documentation.  Escapes
       sequences of the form \[name] denote glyphs too.

   Single-Character Escapes
       \"     Start of a comment.  Everything up to the end  of
              the line is ignored.
       \#     Everything  up  to and including the next newline
              is ignored.  This is interpreted  in  copy  mode.
              This  is like \" except that the terminating new-
              line is ignored as well.
       \*s    The string stored in  the  string  variable  with
              one-character name s.
       \*(st  The  string  stored  in  the string variable with
              two-character name st.

              The  string  stored  in  the string variable with
              arbitrarily long  name  stringvar,  taking  arg1,
              arg2, ... as arguments.
       \$0    The  name by which the current macro was invoked.
              The als request can make a macro have  more  than
              one name.
       \$x    Macro  or string argument with one-digit number x
              in the range 1 to 9.
       \$(xy  Macro or string argument with two-digit number xy
              (larger than zero).
       \$[nexp]
              Macro  or string argument with number nexp, where
              nexp is a numerical expression evaluating  to  an
              integer >=1.
       \$*    In  a  macro  or string, the concatenation of all
              the arguments separated by spaces.
       \$@    In a macro or string, the  concatenation  of  all
              the  arguments  with  each  surrounded  by double
              quotes, and separated by spaces.
       \$^    In a macro, the representation of all  parameters
              as if they were an argument to the ds request.
       \\     reduces  to  a  single backslash; useful to delay
              its interpretation as escape  character  in  copy
              mode.  For a printable backslash, use \e, or even
              better \[rs], to be independent from the  current
              escape character.
       \'     The  acute  accent  ´;  same as \(aa.  Unescaped:
              apostrophe, right quotation  mark,  single  quote

              thing in the diversion.  anything is read in copy
              mode.   See also the escape sequences \!  and \?.
       \space Unpaddable  space  size  space  glyph  (no   line
              break).

              declared  with the cflags request to be transpar-
              ent for the purposes of end-of-sentence  recogni-
              tion.
       \/     Increases  the  width  of  the preceding glyph so
              that the spacing between that glyph and the  fol-
              lowing glyph is correct if the following glyph is
              a roman glyph.
       \,     Modifies the spacing of the  following  glyph  so
              that  the spacing between that glyph and the pre-
              ceding glyph is correct if the preceding glyph is
              a roman glyph.
       \~     Unbreakable  space  that  stretches like a normal
              inter-word space when a line is adjusted.
       \:     Inserts a zero-width break point (similar  to  \%
              but without a soft hyphen character).
       \newline

       The escape sequences \e, \., \", \$, \*, \a, \n, \t, \g,
       and \newline are interpreted in copy mode.

       Escape sequences starting with \( or \[ do not represent
       single  character escape sequences, but introduce escape
       names with two or more characters.

       If a backslash is followed by a character that does  not
       constitute  a  defined escape sequence, the backslash is
       silently ignored and the character maps to itself.

   Special Characters
       [Note: `Special Characters' is a misnomer;  those  enti-
       ties are (output) glyphs, not (input) characters.]

       Common  special  characters  are  predefined  by  escape
       sequences of the form \(xy  with  characters  x  and  y.
       Some of these exist in the usual font while most of them
       are only available in the special font.  Below  you  can
       find  a  selection  of the most important glyphs; a com-
       plete list can be found in groff_char(7).

   Strings
       Strings are  defined  by  the  ds  request  and  can  be
       retrieved by the \* escape sequence.

       Strings  share their name space with macros.  So strings
       and macros without arguments are roughly equivalent;  it
       is  possible  to  call  a  string like a macro and vice-
       versa, but this often leads  to  unpredictable  results.
       The  following  string  is  the  only  one predefined in
       groff.

       \*[.T]    The name of the current output device as spec-
                 ified by the -T command line option.

REGISTERS
       Registers  are  variables that store a value.  In groff,
       most  registers  store  numerical  values  (see  section
       NUMERICAL  EXPRESSIONS  above), but some can also hold a
       string value.

       Each register is given a name.  Arbitrary registers  can
       be defined and set with the nr request.

       The  value  stored in a register can be retrieved by the
       escape sequences introduced by \n.

       Most useful are predefined registers.  In the  following
       the  notation  name is used to refer to register name to
       make clear that we speak about registers.   Please  keep
       in mind that the \n[] decoration is not part of the reg-
       ister name.

   Read-only Registers
       The following  registers  have  predefined  values  that
       should  not  be modified by the user (usually, registers
       starting with a dot a read-only).  Mostly, they  provide
       information  on  the  current  settings or store results
       from request calls.

COMPATIBILITY
       The  differences  of the groff language in comparison to
       classical troff as defined by [CSTR #54] are  documented
       in groff_diff(7).

       The  groff  system  provides  a  compatibility mode, see
       groff(1) on how to invoke this.

BUGS
       Report bugs to the groff bug mailing list Include a com-
       plete, self-contained example that will allow the bug to
       be reproduced, and say which version of  groff  you  are
       using.
