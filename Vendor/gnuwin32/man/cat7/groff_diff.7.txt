GROFF_DIFF(7)                                     GROFF_DIFF(7)



NAME
       groff_diff - differences between GNU troff and classical
       troff

DESCRIPTION
       This manual  page  describes  the  language  differences
       between  groff, the GNU roff text processing system, and
       the classical roff formatter  of  the  freely  available
       Unix 7 of the 1970s, documented in the Troff User's Man-
       ual by Ossanna and Kernighan.   This  inludes  the  roff
       language  as  well  as  the  intermediate  output format
       (troff output).

       The section SEE ALSO gives pointers to both the  classi-
       cal roff and the modern groff documentation.

GROFF LANGUAGE
       In  this  section, all additional features of groff com-
       pared to the classical Unix 7  troff  are  described  in
       detail.

   Long names
       The  names  of  number registers, fonts, strings/macros/
       diversions, special characters (glyphs), and colors  can
       be  of any length.  In escape sequences, additionally to
       the classical `(xx'  construction  for  a  two-character
       glyph  name, you can use `[xxx]' for a name of arbitrary
       length.

       \[xxx] Print the special character (glyph) called xxx.

       \[comp1 comp2 ...]
              Print composite glyph consisting of multiple com-
              ponents.   Example: `\[A ho]' is capital letter A
              with ogonek which  finally  maps  to  glyph  name
              `u0041_0328'.    See  the  groff  info  file  for
              details how a glyph name for a composite glyph is
              constructed,  and  groff_char(7)  for  a  list of
              glyph name components  used  in  composite  glyph
              names.

       \f[xxx]
              Set font xxx.  Additionally, \f[] is a new syntax
              form equal to \fP, i.e., to return to the  previ-
              ous font.

       \*[xxx arg1 arg2 ...]
              Interpolate string xxx, taking arg1, arg2, ... as
              arguments.

       \n[xxx]
              Interpolate number register xxx.

   Fractional point sizes
       A scaled point is equal  to  1/sizescale  points,  where
       sizescale  is specified in the DESC file (1 by default).
       There is a new scale indicator z that has the effect  of
       multiplying by sizescale.  Requests and escape sequences
       in troff interpret arguments that represent a point size
       as  being  in  units of scaled points, but they evaluate
       each such argument using a default scale indicator of z.
       Arguments treated in this way are the argument to the ps
       request, the third argument to the cs request, the  sec-
       ond  and  fourth arguments to the tkf request, the argu-
       ment to the \H escape sequence, and  those  variants  of
       the \s escape sequence that take a numeric expression as
       their argument.

       For example, suppose sizescale is 1000;  then  a  scaled
       point  is equivalent to a millipoint; the call .ps 10.25
       is equivalent to .ps 10.25z and so sets the  point  size
       to  10250 scaled points, which is equal to 10.25 points.

       The number register \n[.s] returns  the  point  size  in
       points  as decimal fraction.  There is also a new number
       register \n[.ps] that returns the point size  in  scaled
       points.

       It would make no sense to use the z scale indicator in a
       numeric expression whose  default  scale  indicator  was
       neither u nor z, and so troff disallows this.  Similarly
       it would make no sense to use a scaling indicator  other
       than  z or u in a numeric expression whose default scale
       indicator was z, and so troff disallows this as well.

       There is also new scale indicator s which multiplies  by
       the number of units in a scaled point.  So, for example,
       \n[.ps]s is equal to 1m.  Be sure not to confuse  the  s
       and z scale indicators.

   Numeric expressions
       Spaces  are  permitted  in  a  number  expression within
       parentheses.

       M indicates a scale of 100ths of an em.  f  indicates  a
       scale of 65536 units, providing fractions for color def-
       initions with the defcolor request.  For example, 0.5f =
       32768u.

       e1>?e2 The maximum of e1 and e2.

       e1<?e2 The minimum of e1 and e2.

       (c;e)  Evaluate e using c as the default scaling indica-
              tor.  If c is missing, ignore scaling  indicators
              in the evaluation of e.

   New escape sequences
       \A'anything'
              This expands to 1 or 0, depending on whether any-
              thing is or is not acceptable as the  name  of  a
              string,  macro, diversion, number register, envi-
              ronment, font, or color.  It returns  0  if  any-
              thing  is  empty.   This is useful if you want to
              look up user input in some  sort  of  associative
              table.

       \B'anything'
              This expands to 1 or 0, depending on whether any-
              thing is or is not a  valid  numeric  expression.
              It returns 0 if anything is empty.

       \C'xxx'
              Typeset  glyph  named  xxx.   Normally it is more
              convenient to use \[xxx].  But \C has the  advan-
              tage  that  it is compatible with recent versions
              of UNIX and is available in compatibility mode.

       \E     This is equivalent to an escape character, but it
              is  not  interpreted  in copy mode.  For example,
              strings to start and end superscripting could  be
              defined like this

                     .ds  {  \v'-.3m'\s'\En[.s]*6u/10u'  .ds  }
                     \s0\v'.3m'

              The use of \E ensures that these definitions work
              even  if  \*{  gets interpreted in copy mode (for
              example, by being used in a macro argument).

       \Ff    \F(fm \F[fam] Change font family.   This  is  the
              same  as  the fam request.  \F[] switches back to
              the previous color (note that \FP won't work;  it
              selects font family `P' instead).

       \mx    \m(xx  \m[xxx]  Set drawing color.  \m[] switches
              back to the previous color.

       \Mx    \M(xx \M[xxx] Set  background  color  for  filled
              objects  drawn  with the \D'...'  commands.  \M[]
              switches back to the previous color.

       \N'n'  Typeset the glyph with index  n  in  the  current
              font.   n  can be any integer.  Most devices only
              have glyphs with indices between 0 and  255.   If
              the  current  font  does not contain a glyph with
              that code, special fonts are not  searched.   The
              \N  escape  sequence  can be conveniently used in
              conjunction with the char request, for example

                     .char \[phone] \f(ZD\N'37'

              The index of each glyph is given  in  the  fourth
              column  in  the  font  description file after the
              charset  command.   It  is  possible  to  include
              unnamed  glyphs  in  the font description file by
              using a name of ---; the \N  escape  sequence  is
              the only way to use these.

       \On    \O[n]  Suppress  troff  output.  The escapes \O2,
              \O3, \O4, and \O5 are intended for  internal  use
              by grohtml.

              \O0    Disable  any  ditroff  glyphs  from  being
                     emitted to  the  device  driver,  provided
                     that  the escape occurs at the outer level
                     (see \O3 and \O4).

              \O1    Enable output of glyphs, provided that the
                     escape occurs at the outer level.

                     \O0  and  \O1  also  reset  the  registers
                     \n[opminx],  \n[opminy],  \n[opmaxx],  and
                     \n[opmaxy]  to  -1.   These four registers
                     mark the top left and  bottom  right  hand
                     corners  of  a  box  which encompasses all
                     written glyphs.

              \O2    Provided that the  escape  occurs  at  the
                     outer  level,  enable output of glyphs and
                     also write out to stderr the  page  number
                     and four registers encompassing the glyphs
                     previously written since the last call  to
                     \O.

              \O3    Begin a nesting level.  At start-up, troff
                     is at outer  level.   This  is  really  an
                     internal  mechanism for grohtml while pro-
                     ducing images.  They are generated by run-
                     ning the troff source through troff to the
                     postscript device and ghostscript to  pro-
                     duce images in PNG format.  The \O3 escape
                     starts a new page if  the  device  is  not
                     html  (to reduce the possibility of images
                     crossing a page boundary).

              \O4    End a nesting level.

              \O5[Pfilename]
                     This escape is grohtml specific.  Provided
                     that this escape occurs at the outer nest-
                     ing level, write filename to stderr.   The
                     position  of  the image, P, must be speci-
                     fied and must be one of  l,  r,  c,  or  i
                     (left, right, centered, inline).  filename
                     is associated with the production  of  the
                     next inline image.

       \R'name 켷'
              This has the same effect as

                     .nr name 켷

       \s(nn  \s(nn  Set  the point size to nn points; nn must
              be exactly two digits.

       \s[켷] \s[n] \s'켷' \s'n' Set  the  point  size  to  n
              scaled  points;  n is a numeric expression with a
              default scale indicator of z.

       \Vx    \V(xx \V[xxx] Interpolate  the  contents  of  the
              environment   variable   xxx,   as   returned  by
              getenv(3).  \V is interpreted in copy mode.

       \Yx    \Y(xx \Y[xxx] This is approximately equivalent to
              \X'\*[xxx]'.   However the contents of the string
              or macro xxx are not interpreted; also it is per-
              mitted  for  xxx  to have been defined as a macro
              and thus contain newlines (it  is  not  permitted
              for the argument to \X to contain newlines).  The
              inclusion of newlines requires  an  extension  to
              the  UNIX troff output format, and confuses driv-
              ers that do not know about this extension.

       \Z'anything'
              Print anything and then  restore  the  horizontal
              and  vertical  position; anything may not contain
              tabs or leaders.

       \$0    The name by which the current macro was  invoked.
              The  als  request can make a macro have more than
              one name.

       \$*    In a macro or string, the  concatenation  of  all
              the arguments separated by spaces.

       \$@    In  a  macro  or string, the concatenation of all
              the arguments  with  each  surrounded  by  double
              quotes, and separated by spaces.

       \$^    In  a macro, the representation of all parameters
              as if they were an argument to the ds request.

       \$(nn  \$[nnn] In a macro or string, this gives the  nn-
              th  or  nnn-th  argument.  Macros and strings can
              have an unlimited number of arguments.

       \?anything\?
              When used  in  a  diversion,  this  transparently
              embeds  anything  in  the diversion.  anything is
              read in copy mode.  When the diversion is reread,
              anything  is  interpreted.  anything may not con-
              tain newlines; use \! if you want to  embed  new-
              lines  in a diversion.  The escape sequence \? is
              also recognized in copy mode and  turned  into  a
              single internal code; it is this code that termi-
              nates anything.  Thus

                     .nr      x      1      .nf      .di      d
                     \?\\?\\\\?\\\\\\\\nx\\\\?\\?\?   .di .nr x
                     2 .di e .d .di .nr x 3 .di f .e .di .nr  x
                     4 .f

              prints 4.

       \/     This  increases  the width of the preceding glyph
              so that the spacing between that  glyph  and  the
              following glyph is correct if the following glyph
              is a roman glyph.  It is a good idea to use  this
              escape sequence whenever an italic glyph is imme-
              diately followed by a  roman  glyph  without  any
              intervening space.

       \,     This  modifies the spacing of the following glyph
              so that the spacing between that  glyph  and  the
              preceding glyph is correct if the preceding glyph
              is a roman glyph.  It is a good idea to use  this
              escape sequence whenever a roman glyph is immedi-
              ately followed by an  italic  glyph  without  any
              intervening space.

       \)     Like  \&  except that it behaves like a character
              declared with the cflags request to be  transpar-
              ent  for the purposes of end-of-sentence recogni-
              tion.

       \~     This produces an unbreakable space that stretches
              like  a  normal  inter-word  space when a line is
              adjusted.

       \:     This causes the insertion of a  zero-width  break
              point.  It is equal to \% within a word but with-
              out insertion of a soft hyphen glyph.

       \#     Everything up to and including the  next  newline
              is  ignored.   This  is interpreted in copy mode.
              It is like \" except that \" does not ignore  the
              terminating newline.

   New requests
       .aln xx yy
              Create  an  alias  xx  for number register object
              named yy.  The new name  and  the  old  name  are
              exactly  equivalent.  If yy is undefined, a warn-
              ing of type reg is generated, and the request  is
              ignored.

       .als xx yy
              Create an alias xx for request, string, macro, or
              diversion object named yy.  The new name and  the
              old name are exactly equivalent (it is similar to
              a hard rather than a soft link).  If yy is  unde-
              fined,  a  warning  of type mac is generated, and
              the request is ignored.  The de, am, di, da,  ds,
              and  as  requests only create a new object if the
              name of the macro, diversion or  string  is  cur-
              rently  undefined  or  if  it  is defined to be a
              request; normally they modify  the  value  of  an
              existing object.

       .am1 xx yy
              Similar   to   .am,  but  compatibility  mode  is
              switched off during execution.  To be  more  pre-
              cise, a `compatibility save' token is inserted at
              the beginning of the macro addition, and a  `com-
              patibility  restore' token at the end.  As a con-
              sequence, the requests am, am1, de, and  de1  can
              be  intermixed  freely  since  the  compatibility
              save/restore tokens only affect the  macro  parts
              defined by .am1 and .ds1.

       .ami xx yy
              Append  to macro indirectly.  See the dei request
              below for more information.

       .ami1 xx yy
              Same as the ami request but compatibility mode is
              switched off during execution.

       .as1 xx yy
              Similar   to   .as,  but  compatibility  mode  is
              switched off during expansion.  To be  more  pre-
              cise, a `compatibility save' token is inserted at
              the beginning of the string, and a `compatibility
              restore' token at the end.  As a consequence, the
              requests as, as1, ds, and ds1 can  be  intermixed
              freely   since   the  compatibility  save/restore
              tokens only affect the  (sub)strings  defined  by
              as1 and ds1.

       .asciify xx
              This request `unformats' the diversion xx in such
              a way that ASCII and space characters  (and  some
              escape   sequences)   that   were  formatted  and
              diverted into xx are treated like ordinary  input
              characters  when xx is reread.  Useful for diver-
              sions in conjunction with the writem request.  It
              can  be  also  used for gross hacks; for example,
              this

                     .tr @.  .di x @nr  n  1  .br  .di  .tr  @@
                     .asciify x .x

              sets  register  n to 1.  Note that glyph informa-
              tion (font, font size, etc.)  is  not  preserved;
              use .unformat instead.

       .backtrace
              Print a backtrace of the input stack on stderr.

       .blm xx
              Set  the  blank  line macro to xx.  If there is a
              blank line macro, it is invoked when a blank line
              is  encountered instead of the usual troff behav-
              iour.

       .box xx
              .boxa xx These requests are similar to the di and
              da  requests  with the exception that a partially
              filled line does not become part of the diversion
              (i.e.,  the  diversion  always  starts with a new
              line) but is restored after ending the diversion,
              discarding the partially filled line which possi-
              bly comes from the diversion.

       .break Break out of a while loop.  See  also  the  while
              and  continue  requests.   Be sure not to confuse
              this with the br request.

       .brp   This is the same as \p.

       .cflags n c1 c2...
              Characters c1, c2,... have properties  determined
              by n, which is ORed from the following:

              1      The  character  ends  sentences (initially
                     characters .?! have this property).

              2      Lines can be broken before  the  character
                     (initially  no  characters have this prop-
                     erty); a line is not broken at a character
                     with  this  property unless the characters
                     on each side both  have  non-zero  hyphen-
                     ation  codes.  This can be overridden with
                     value 64.

              4      Lines can be broken  after  the  character
                     (initially   characters  -\[hy]\[em]  have
                     this property); a line is not broken at  a
                     character  with  this  property unless the
                     characters on each side both have non-zero
                     hyphenation codes.

                     This can be overridden with value 64.

              8      The  glyph  associated with this character
                     overlaps horizontally  (initially  charac-
                     ters  \[ul]\[rn]\[ru]\[radicalex]\[sqrtex]
                     have this property).

              16     The glyph associated with  this  character
                     overlaps vertically (initially glyph \[br]
                     has this property).

              32     An end-of-sentence character  followed  by
                     any  number  of characters with this prop-
                     erty is treated as the end of  a  sentence
                     if followed by a newline or two spaces; in
                     other words the character  is  transparent
                     for the purposes of end-of-sentence recog-
                     nition; this is the same as having a  zero
                     space  factor in TeX (initially characters
                     "')]*\[dg]\[rq] have this property).

              64     Ignore hyphenation code values of the sur-
                     rounding characters.  Use this in combina-
                     tion with values 2  and  4  (initially  no
                     characters have this property).

       .char c string
              [This  request  can  both  define  characters and
              glyphs.]

              Define entity c to be string.  To  be  more  pre-
              cise,  define  (or  even override) a groff entity
              which can be accessed with name c  on  the  input
              side,  and  which uses string on the output side.
              Every time glyph c needs to be printed, string is
              processed  in  a  temporary  environment  and the
              result is wrapped up into a single object.   Com-
              patibility  mode  is  turned  off  and the escape
              character is set to \ while string is being  pro-
              cessed.   Any  emboldening,  constant  spacing or
              track kerning is applied to  this  object  rather
              than to individual glyphs in string.

              A  groff  object  defined  by this request can be
              used just like a normal  glyph  provided  by  the
              output  device.   In  particular other characters
              can be translated to it with the tr  request;  it
              can  be  made the leader glyph by the lc request;
              repeated patterns can be  drawn  with  the  glyph
              using  the \l and \L escape sequences; words con-
              taining c can be  hyphenated  correctly,  if  the
              hcode  request  is  used  to  give  the  object a
              hyphenation code.

              There is a special anti-recursion feature: Use of
              glyph  within  the  glyph's definition is handled
              like normal glyphs not defined with char.

              A glyph definition can be removed with the  rchar
              request.

       .chop xx
              Chop  the  last  element  off  macro,  string, or
              diversion xx.  This is useful  for  removing  the
              newline from the end of diversions that are to be
              interpolated as strings.

       .close stream
              Close the stream named  stream;  stream  will  no
              longer  be  an  acceptable  argument to the write
              request.  See the open request.

       .composite glyph1 glyph2
              Map glyph name glyph1 to glyph name glyph2 if  it
              is  used in \[...]  with more than one component.

       .continue
              Finish the current iteration  of  a  while  loop.
              See also the while and break requests.

       .color n
              If  n is non-zero or missing, enable colors (this
              is the default), otherwise disable them.

       .cp n  If n is non-zero or missing, enable compatibility
              mode,  otherwise  disable  it.   In compatibility
              mode, long names  are  not  recognized,  and  the
              incompatibilities  caused  by  long  names do not
              arise.

       .defcolor xxx scheme color_components
              Define color xxx.  scheme can be one of the  fol-
              lowing values: rgb (three components), cmy (three
              components), cmyk (four components), and gray  or
              grey  (one  component).   Color components can be
              given either as a hexadecimal string or as  posi-
              tive  decimal  integers  in the range 0-65535.  A
              hexadecimal string contains all color  components
              concatenated;  it must start with either # or ##.
              The former specifies  hex  values  in  the  range
              0-255  (which  are internally multiplied by 257),
              the  latter  in  the  range  0-65535.   Examples:
              #FFC0CB  (pink), ##ffff0000ffff (magenta).  A new
              scaling indicator f  has  been  introduced  which
              multiplies its value by 65536; this makes it con-
              venient to specify color components as  fractions
              in the range 0 to 1.  Example:

                     .defcolor darkgreen rgb 0.1f 0.5f 0.2f

              Note  that f is the default scaling indicator for
              the defcolor request, thus the above statement is
              equivalent to

                     .defcolor darkgreen rgb 0.1 0.5 0.2

              The  color  named  default  (which is device-spe-
              cific) can't be redefined.  It is  possible  that
              the  default color for \M and \m is not the same.

       .de1 xx yy
              Similar  to  .de,  but  compatibility   mode   is
              switched  off  during  execution.   On entry, the
              current compatibility mode is saved and  restored
              at exit.

       .dei xx yy
              Define macro indirectly.  The following example

                     .ds xx aa .ds yy bb .dei xx yy

              is equivalent to

                     .de aa bb

       .dei1 xx yy
              Similar to the dei request but compatibility mode
              is switched off during execution.

       .device anything
              This is (almost) the same as the \X escape.  any-
              thing  is  read  in  copy  mode;  a  leading " is
              stripped.

       .devicem xx
              This is the same as the \Y escape (to  embed  the
              contents  of a macro into the intermediate output
              preceded with `x X').

       .do xxx
              Interpret .xxx with compatibility mode  disabled.
              For example,

                     .do fam T

              would have the same effect as

                     .fam T

              except  that  it would work even if compatibility
              mode had been enabled.  Note  that  the  previous
              compatibility  mode  is restored before any files
              sourced by xxx are interpreted.

       .ds1 xx yy
              Similar  to  .ds,  but  compatibility   mode   is
              switched  off  during expansion.  To be more pre-
              cise, a `compatibility save' token is inserted at
              the beginning of the string, and a `compatibility
              restore' token at the end.

       .ecs   Save current escape character.

       .ecr   Restore escape character saved with ecs.  Without
              a  previous  call  to  ecs,  `\'  will be the new
              escape character.

       .evc xx
              Copy the contents of environment xx to  the  cur-
              rent environment.  No pushing or popping of envi-
              ronments is done.

       .fam xx
              Set the current font family to xx.   The  current
              font  family  is part of the current environment.
              If xx is missing, switch back  to  previous  font
              family.   The  value at start-up is `T'.  See the
              description of the sty request for more  informa-
              tion on font families.

       .fchar c string
              Define  fallback  character  (or  glyph)  c to be
              string.  The syntax of this request is  the  same
              as  the char request; the only difference is that
              a glyph defined with char hides  the  glyph  with
              the  same  name  in  the  current font, whereas a
              glyph defined with fchar is checked only  if  the
              particular glyph isn't found in the current font.
              This test happens before checking special  fonts.

       .fcolor c
              Set the fill color to c.  If c is missing, switch
              to the previous fill color.

       .fschar f c string
              Define fallback character (or glyph) c for font f
              to  be string.  The syntax of this request is the
              same as the  char  request  (with  an  additional
              argument  to  specify  the font); a glyph defined
              with fschar is searched after the list  of  fonts
              declared with the fspecial request but before the
              list of fonts declared with .special.

       .fspecial f s1 s2...
              When the current font is f, fonts s1, s2,...  are
              special,  that  is,  they are searched for glyphs
              not in the current font.  Any fonts specified  in
              the  special  request  are  searched  after fonts
              specified in the fspecial request.  Without argu-
              ment,  reset  the list of global special fonts to
              be empty.

       .ftr f g
              Translate font f to g.  Whenever a font  named  f
              is referred to in an \f escape sequence, in the F
              and S conditional operators, or in  the  ft,  ul,
              bd,  cs,  tkf,  special,  fspecial,  fp,  or  sty
              requests, font g is used.  If g  is  missing,  or
              equal to f then font f is not translated.

       .fzoom f zoom
              Set  zoom  factor  zoom  for font f.  zoom must a
              non-negative integer multiple of 1/1000th.  If it
              is missing or is equal to zero, it means the same
              as 1000, namely no magnification.  f  must  be  a
              real font name, not a style.

       .gcolor c
              Set  the  glyph  color  to  c.   If c is missing,
              switch to the previous glyph color.

       .hcode c1 code1 c2 code2...
              Set the hyphenation code of character c1 to code1
              and that of c2 to code2.  A hyphenation code must
              be a single input character (not a special  char-
              acter)  other than a digit or a space.  Initially
              each lower-case  letter  a-z  has  a  hyphenation
              code, which is itself, and each upper-case letter
              A-Z has a hyphenation code which  is  the  lower-
              case   version  of  itself.   See  also  the  hpf
              request.

       .hla lang
              Set the current  hyphenation  language  to  lang.
              Hyphenation  exceptions  specified  with  the  hw
              request and hyphenation patterns  specified  with
              the hpf request are both associated with the cur-
              rent hyphenation language.  The  hla  request  is
              usually  invoked  by the troffrc file to set up a
              default language.

       .hlm n Set the maximum number of consecutive  hyphenated
              lines  to n.  If n is negative, there is no maxi-
              mum.  The default value is  -1.   This  value  is
              associated  with  the  current environment.  Only
              lines output from an  environment  count  towards
              the  maximum  associated  with  that environment.
              Hyphens resulting from \% are  counted;  explicit
              hyphens are not.

       .hpf file
              Read  hyphenation  patterns  from  file;  this is
              searched for in the same way  that  name.tmac  is
              searched for when the -mname option is specified.
              It should have the same format  as  (simple)  TeX
              patterns files.  More specifically, the following
              scanning rules are implemented.

                    A percent sign starts a comment (up to the
                     end  of  the  line)  even if preceded by a
                     backslash.

                    No support for `digraphs' like \$.

                    ^^xx (x is 0-9 or a-f) and ^^x  (character
                     code  of  x in the range 0-127) are recog-
                     nized; other use of ^ causes an error.

                    No macro expansion.

                    hpf  checks  for  the   expression   \pat-
                     terns{...}   (possibly   with   whitespace
                     before and after the braces).   Everything
                     between the braces is taken as hyphenation
                     patterns.  Consequently, { and }  are  not
                     allowed in patterns.

                    Similarly,  \hyphenation{...} gives a list
                     of hyphenation exceptions.

                    \endinput is recognized also.

                    For backwards compatibility, if  \patterns
                     is missing, the whole file is treated as a
                     list of hyphenation patterns (only  recog-
                     nizing  the  % character as the start of a
                     comment).

              Use the hpfcode request to map the encoding  used
              in  hyphenation  patterns  files to groff's input
              encoding.

              The set of  hyphenation  patterns  is  associated
              with the current language set by the hla request.
              The hpf request is usually invoked by the troffrc
              file;  a  second  call  replaces the old patterns
              with the new ones.

       .hpfa file
              The same as hpf except that the hyphenation  pat-
              terns  from  file  are  appended  to the patterns
              already loaded in the current language.

       .hpfcode a b c d ...
              After reading a hyphenation  patterns  file  with
              the  hpf  or hpfa request, convert all characters
              with character code a in the recently  read  pat-
              terns to character code b, character code c to d,
              etc.  Initially, all character codes map to them-
              selves.   The  arguments of hpfcode must be inte-
              gers in the range 0 to 255.  Note that it is even
              possible to use character codes which are invalid
              in groff otherwise.

       .hym n Set the hyphenation margin to n: when the current
              adjustment mode is not b, the line is not hyphen-
              ated if the line is no more than  n  short.   The
              default  hyphenation  margin  is  0.  The default
              scaling indicator for this  request  is  m.   The
              hyphenation margin is associated with the current
              environment.  The current hyphenation  margin  is
              available in the \n[.hym] register.

       .hys n Set  the hyphenation space to n: When the current
              adjustment mode is b don't hyphenate the line  if
              the  line can be justified by adding no more than
              n extra space to each word  space.   The  default
              hyphenation  space  is  0.   The  default scaling
              indicator for this request is m.  The hyphenation
              space is associated with the current environment.
              The current hyphenation space is available in the
              \n[.hys] register.

       .itc n macro
              Variant  of .it for which a line interrupted with
              \c counts as one input line.

       .kern n
              If n is  non-zero  or  missing,  enable  pairwise
              kerning, otherwise disable it.

       .length xx string
              Compute the length of string and return it in the
              number register  xx  (which  is  not  necessarily
              defined before).

       .linetabs n
              If  n  is  non-zero  or missing, enable line-tabs
              mode,  otherwise  disable  it   (which   is   the
              default).   In  line-tabs mode, tab distances are
              computed relative to the (current)  output  line.
              Otherwise  they  are  taken relative to the input
              line.  For example, the following

                     .ds x a\t\c .ds y b\t\c .ds z c .ta 1i  3i
                     \*x \*y \*z

              yields

                     a         b         c

              In line-tabs mode, the same code gives

                     a         b                   c

              Line-tabs  mode  is  associated  with the current
              environment;  the   read-only   number   register
              \n[.linetabs]  is  set to 1 if in line-tabs mode,
              and 0 otherwise.

       .mso file
              The same as the so request except  that  file  is
              searched  for  in  the  same directories as macro
              files for the the -m command line option.  If the
              file  name  to be included has the form name.tmac
              and  it  isn't  found,  mso  tries   to   include
              tmac.name instead and vice versa.

       .nop anything
              Execute anything.  This is similar to `.if 1'.

       .nroff Make  the  n  built-in  condition  true and the t
              built-in condition false.  This can  be  reversed
              using the troff request.

       .open stream filename
              Open  filename  for  writing  and  associate  the
              stream named stream with it.  See also the  close
              and write requests.

       .opena stream filename
              Like  open,  but if filename exists, append to it
              instead of truncating it.

       .output string
              Emit string directly to the  intermediate  output
              (subject  to  copy-mode  interpretation); this is
              similar to \! used at the top level.  An  initial
              double  quote  in string is stripped off to allow
              initial blanks.

       .pev   Print the current environment  and  each  defined
              environment state on stderr.

       .pnr   Print  the  names  and  contents of all currently
              defined number registers on stderr.

       .psbb filename
              Get the bounding box of a PostScript image  file-
              name.  This file must conform to Adobe's Document
              Structuring Conventions; the command looks for  a
              %%BoundingBox comment to extract the bounding box
              values.  After a successful call, the coordinates
              (in PostScript units) of the lower left and upper
              right  corner  can  be  found  in  the  registers
              \n[llx],  \n[lly],  \n[urx], and \n[ury], respec-
              tively.  If some error  has  occurred,  the  four
              registers are set to zero.

       .pso command
              This  behaves  like  the  so  request except that
              input comes from the standard output of  command.

       .ptr   Print  the  names and positions of all traps (not
              including input line traps and  diversion  traps)
              on stderr.  Empty slots in the page trap list are
              printed as well, because they can affect the pri-
              ority of subsequently planted traps.

       .pvs 켷
              Set  the  post-vertical  line space to n; default
              scale indicator is p.  This  value  is  added  to
              each  line  after  it  has  been output.  With no
              argument, the post-vertical line space is set  to
              its previous value.

              The  total vertical line spacing consists of four
              components: .vs and  \x  with  a  negative  value
              which  are applied before the line is output, and
              .pvs and \x  with  a  positive  value  which  are
              applied after the line is output.

       .rchar c1 c2...
              Remove the definitions of glyphs c1, c2,...  This
              undoes the effect of a char request.

       .return
              Within a macro, return  immediately.   If  called
              with  an  argument, return twice, namely from the
              current  macro  and  from  the  macro  one  level
              higher.  No effect otherwise.

       .rfschar c1 c2...
              Remove  the  font-specific  definitions of glyphs
              c1, c2,...  This undoes the effect  of  a  fschar
              request.

       .rj    .rj  n  Right  justify  the  next  n input lines.
              Without an argument right justify the next  input
              line.   The number of lines to be right justified
              is  available  in  the  \n[.rj]  register.   This
              implicitly does .ce 0.  The ce request implicitly
              does .rj 0.

       .rnn xx yy
              Rename number register xx to yy.

       .schar c string
              Define global fallback character (or glyph) c  to
              be  string.   The  syntax  of this request is the
              same as the char request; a  glyph  defined  with
              schar   is  searched  after  the  list  of  fonts
              declared with the special request but before  the
              mounted special fonts.

       .shc c Set  the  soft  hyphen  character  to c.  If c is
              omitted, the soft hyphen character is set to  the
              default  \[hy].  The soft hyphen character is the
              glyph which is inserted when a word is hyphenated
              at  a  line  break.  If the soft hyphen character
              does not exist in the font of the  glyph  immedi-
              ately preceding a potential break point, then the
              line is not broken at that point.  Neither  defi-
              nitions  (specified  with  the  char request) nor
              translations (specified with the tr request)  are
              considered  when  finding the soft hyphen charac-
              ter.

       .shift n
              In a macro, shift the arguments by  n  positions:
              argument i becomes argument i-n; arguments 1 to n
              are no longer available.  If n is missing,  argu-
              ments  are  shifted  by  1.  Shifting by negative
              amounts is currently undefined.

       .sizes s1 s2...sn [0]
              This command is similar to the sizes command of a
              DESC  file.  It sets the available font sizes for
              the current font to s1, s2,..., sn scaled points.
              The  list  of  sizes  can  be  terminated  by  an
              optional 0.  Each si can also be a range of sizes
              m-n.  Contrary to the font file command, the list
              can't extend over more than a single line.

       .special s1 s2...
              Fonts s1, s2,... are special and are searched for
              glyphs  not  in  the current font.  Without argu-
              ments, reset the list  of  special  fonts  to  be
              empty.

       .spreadwarn limit
              Make troff emit a warning if the additional space
              inserted for each space between words in an  out-
              put line is larger or equal to limit.  A negative
              value is changed to zero; no argument toggles the
              warning  on  and off without changing limit.  The
              default scaling  indicator  is  m.   At  startup,
              spreadwarn  is  deactivated,  and limit is set to
              3m.  For example, .spreadwarn 0.2m causes a warn-
              ing  if  troff  must  add  0.2m  or more for each
              interword space  in  a  line.   This  request  is
              active  only if text is justified to both margins
              (using .ad b).

       .sty n f
              Associate style f with font position n.   A  font
              position  can be associated either with a font or
              with a style.  The current font is the index of a
              font  position  and so is also either a font or a
              style.  When it is a  style,  the  font  that  is
              actually  used  is  the font the name of which is
              the concatenation of the name of the current fam-
              ily and the name of the current style.  For exam-
              ple, if the current font is 1 and font position 1
              is  associated  with style R and the current font
              family is T, then font TR is used.  If  the  cur-
              rent font is not a style, then the current family
              is ignored.  When the requests cs, bd,  tkf,  uf,
              or fspecial are applied to a style, then they are
              applied instead to the member of the current fam-
              ily  corresponding  to  that  style.  The default
              family can  be  set  with  the  -f  command  line
              option.  The styles command in the DESC file con-
              trols which font positions (if any) are initially
              associated with styles rather than fonts.

       .substring xx n1 [n2]
              Replace  the  string  named xx with the substring
              defined by the indices  n1  and  n2.   The  first
              character  in  the  string has index 0.  If n2 is
              omitted, it is taken to be equal to the  string's
              length.  If the index value n1 or n2 is negative,
              it is counted from the end of the  string,  going
              backwards:  The  last character has index -1, the
              character before the last character has index -2,
              etc.

       .tkf f s1 n1 s2 n2
              Enable  track  kerning for font f.  When the cur-
              rent font is  f  the  width  of  every  glyph  is
              increased  by  an  amount between n1 and n2; when
              the current point size is less than or  equal  to
              s1  the  width  is  increased  by  n1; when it is
              greater  than  or  equal  to  s2  the  width   is
              increased  by  n2; when the point size is greater
              than or equal to s1 and less than or equal to  s2
              the increase in width is a linear function of the
              point size.

       .tm1 string
              Similar to the tm request, string is read in copy
              mode  and  written  on the standard error, but an
              initial double quote in string is stripped off to
              allow initial blanks.

       .tmc string
              Similar  to  tm1 but without writing a final new-
              line.

       .trf filename
              Transparently output the contents of  file  file-
              name.   Each line is output as if preceded by \!;
              however, the lines are not subject  to  copy-mode
              interpretation.   If the file does not end with a
              newline, then a newline is added.   For  example,
              you  can define a macro x containing the contents
              of file f, using

                     .di x .trf f .di

              Unlike with the cf request, the file cannot  con-
              tain  characters  such  as NUL that are not valid
              troff input characters.

       .trin abcd
              This is the same as the tr  request  except  that
              the  asciify  request uses the character code (if
              any) before the character translation.  Example:

                     .trin ax .di xxx a .br .di .xxx  .trin  aa
                     .asciify xxx .xxx

              The result is x a.  Using tr, the result would be
              x x.

       .trnt abcd
              This is the same as the tr  request  except  that
              the  translations  do  not  apply to text that is
              transparently throughput into  a  diversion  with
              \!.  For example,

                     .tr ab .di x \!.tm a .di .x

              prints  b;  if  trnt  is  used  instead  of tr it
              prints a.

       .troff Make the n built-in condition false,  and  the  t
              built-in  condition true.  This undoes the effect
              of the nroff request.

       .unformat xx
              This request `unformats' the diversion xx.   Con-
              trary to the asciify request, which tries to con-
              vert formatted elements of the diversion back  to
              input  tokens as much as possible, .unformat only
              handles tabs and spaces  between  words  (usually
              caused  by  spaces or newlines in the input) spe-
              cially.  The former are treated as if  they  were
              input  tokens,  and  the  latter  are stretchable
              again.  Note that the vertical size of  lines  is
              not  preserved.   Glyph  information  (font, font
              size, space width, etc.) is retained.  Useful  in
              conjunction with the box and boxa requests.

       .vpt n Enable  vertical position traps if n is non-zero,
              disable them otherwise.  Vertical position  traps
              are  traps  set  by the wh or dt requests.  Traps
              set by the it request are not  vertical  position
              traps.   The parameter that controls whether ver-
              tical position traps are enabled is global.  Ini-
              tially vertical position traps are enabled.

       .warn n
              Control  warnings.   n  is the sum of the numbers
              associated  with  each  warning  that  is  to  be
              enabled;  all  other  warnings are disabled.  The
              number associated with each warning is listed  in
              troff(1).   For  example,  .warn  0  disables all
              warnings,  and  .warn  1  disables  all  warnings
              except  that  about  missing glyphs.  If n is not
              given, all warnings are enabled.

       .warnscale si
              Set the scaling indicator used in warnings to si.
              Valid  values  for  si are u, i, c, p, and P.  At
              startup, it is set to i.

       .while c anything
              While condition c is  true,  accept  anything  as
              input; c can be any condition acceptable to an if
              request; anything can comprise multiple lines  if
              the  first  line starts with \{ and the last line
              ends with \}.  See also the  break  and  continue
              requests.

       .write stream anything
              Write   anything  to  the  stream  named  stream.
              stream must previously have been the  subject  of
              an  open request.  anything is read in copy mode;
              a leading " is stripped.

       .writec stream anything
              Similar to write but without writing a final new-
              line.

       .writem stream xx
              Write  the  contents of the macro or string xx to
              the stream named stream.  stream must  previously
              have  been the subject of an open request.  xx is
              read in copy mode.

   Extended escape sequences
       \D'...'
              All drawing commands of groff's intermediate out-
              put  are  accepted.   See subsection Drawing Com-
              mands below for more information.

   Extended requests
       .cf filename
              When used in a  diversion,  this  embeds  in  the
              diversion  an  object  which,  when  reread, will
              cause the contents of filename  to  be  transpar-
              ently  copied  through  to  the  output.  In UNIX
              troff, the contents of  filename  is  immediately
              copied   through  to  the  output  regardless  of
              whether there is a current diversion; this behav-
              iour is so anomalous that it must be considered a
              bug.

       .de xx yy
              .am xx yy .ds xx yy  .as xx yy  In  compatibility
              mode,  these  requests  behaves  similar to .de1,
              .am1, .ds1, and .as1, respectively:  A  `compati-
              bility  save' token is inserted at the beginning,
              and a `compatibility restore' token at  the  end,
              with compatibility mode switched on during execu-
              tion.

       .ev xx If xx is not a number, this switches to  a  named
              environment called xx.  The environment should be
              popped with a matching  ev  request  without  any
              arguments,  just  as  for  numbered environments.
              There is no limit on the number of named environ-
              ments;  they are created the first time that they
              are referenced.

       .ss m n
              When two arguments are given to the  ss  request,
              the  second  argument  gives  the  sentence space
              size.  If the second argument is not  given,  the
              sentence space size is the same as the word space
              size.  Like the word  space  size,  the  sentence
              space   is   in  units  of  one  twelfth  of  the
              spacewidth parameter for the current font.   Ini-
              tially  both the word space size and the sentence
              space size are 12.  Contrary to UNIX  troff,  GNU
              troff  handles this request in nroff mode also; a
              given value is then rounded down to  the  nearest
              multiple  of 12.  The sentence space size is used
              in two circumstances.  If the end of  a  sentence
              occurs  at  the  end of a line in fill mode, then
              both an inter-word space and a sentence space are
              added; if two spaces follow the end of a sentence
              in the middle of a line, then the second space is
              a  sentence  space.   Note  that the behaviour of
              UNIX troff are  exactly  that  exhibited  by  GNU
              troff  if a second argument is never given to the
              ss request.  In GNU troff, as in UNIX troff,  you
              should  always  follow  a  sentence with either a
              newline or two spaces.

       .ta n1 n2...nn T r1 r2...rn
              Set tabs at positions n1, n2,..., nn and then set
              tabs  at  nn+r1,  nn+r2,...,  nn+rn  and  then at
              nn+rn+r1, nn+rn+r2,..., nn+rn+rn, and so on.  For
              example,

                     .ta T .5i

              sets tabs every half an inch.

   New number registers
       The following read-only registers are available:

       \n[.br]
              Within  a macro call, it is set to 1 if the macro
              is called with  the  `normal'  control  character
              (`.'  by  default), and set to 0 otherwise.  This
              allows to reliably modify requests.

                     .als bp*orig bp .de bp .tm before  bp  .ie
                     \\n[.br]  .bp*orig  .el 'bp*orig .tm after
                     bp ..

              Using this register outside of a macro  makes  no
              sense (it always returns zero in such cases).

       \n[.C] 1  if  compatibility  mode is in effect, 0 other-
              wise.

       \n[.cdp]
              The depth of the last glyph added to the  current
              environment.  It is positive if the glyph extends
              below the baseline.

       \n[.ce]
              The number of lines remaining to be centered,  as
              set by the ce request.

       \n[.cht]
              The height of the last glyph added to the current
              environment.  It is positive if the glyph extends
              above the baseline.

       \n[.color]
              1 if colors are enabled, 0 otherwise.

       \n[.csk]
              The  skew  of the last glyph added to the current
              environment.  The skew of a glyph is how  far  to
              the  right of the center of a glyph the center of
              an accent over that glyph should be placed.

       \n[.ev]
              The name or number of  the  current  environment.
              This is a string-valued register.

       \n[.fam]
              The current font family.  This is a string-valued
              register.

       \n[.fn]
              The current (internal) real font name.  This is a
              string-valued register.  If the current font is a
              style, the value of \n[.fn] is  the  proper  con-
              catenation of family and style name.

       \n[.fp]
              The number of the next free font position.

       \n[.g] Always  1.   Macros  should use this to determine
              whether they are running under GNU troff.

       \n[.height]
              The current height of the font as set with \H.

       \n[.hla]
              The current hyphenation language as  set  by  the
              hla request.

       \n[.hlc]
              The  number  of immediately preceding consecutive
              hyphenated lines.

       \n[.hlm]
              The maximum allowed number of consecutive hyphen-
              ated lines, as set by the hlm request.

       \n[.hy]
              The  current  hyphenation flags (as set by the hy
              request).

       \n[.hym]
              The current hyphenation margin (as set by the hym
              request).

       \n[.hys]
              The  current hyphenation space (as set by the hys
              request).

       \n[.in]
              The indentation that applies to the current  out-
              put line.

       \n[.int]
              Set  to  a  positive value if last output line is
              interrupted (i.e., if it contains \c).

       \n[.kern]
              1 if pairwise kerning is enabled, 0 otherwise.

       \n[.lg]
              The current ligature  mode  (as  set  by  the  lg
              request).

       \n[.linetabs]
              The   current  line-tabs  mode  (as  set  by  the
              linetabs request).

       \n[.ll]
              The line length that applies to the current  out-
              put line.

       \n[.lt]
              The title length as set by the lt request.

       \n[.m] The name of the current drawing color.  This is a
              string-valued register.

       \n[.M] The name of the current background  color.   This
              is a string-valued register.

       \n[.ne]
              The  amount  of space that was needed in the last
              ne request that caused a trap to be sprung.  Use-
              ful  in conjunction with the \n[.trunc] register.

       \n[.ns]
              1 if no-space mode is active, 0 otherwise.

       \n[.pe]
              1  during  a  page  ejection  caused  by  the  bp
              request, 0 otherwise.

       \n[.pn]
              The number of the next page, either the value set
              by a pn request, or the  number  of  the  current
              page plus 1.

       \n[.ps]
              The current point size in scaled points.

       \n[.psr]
              The last-requested point size in scaled points.

       \n[.pvs]
              The  current post-vertical line space as set with
              the pvs request.

       \n[.rj]
              The number of lines to be right-justified as  set
              by the rj request.

       \n[.slant]
              The slant of the current font as set with \S.

       \n[.sr]
              The last requested point size in points as a dec-
              imal fraction.  This is a string-valued register.

       \n[.ss]
              \n[.sss]  These give the values of the parameters
              set by the first and second arguments of  the  ss
              request.

       \n[.sty]
              The  current font style.  This is a string-valued
              register.

       \n[.tabs]
              A string representation of the current  tab  set-
              tings  suitable  for use as an argument to the ta
              request.

       \n[.trunc]
              The amount of vertical  space  truncated  by  the
              most  recently sprung vertical position trap, or,
              if the trap was sprung by a ne request, minus the
              amount  of  vertical  motion  produced  by the ne
              request.  In  other  words, at the point  a  trap
              is   sprung,   it  represents  the  difference of
              what the vertical position  would have  been  but
              for  the  trap,  and  what  the vertical position
              actually is.   Useful  in  conjunction  with  the
              \n[.ne] register.

       \n[.U] Set  to  1 if in safer mode and to 0 if in unsafe
              mode (as given with the -U command line  option).

       \n[.vpt]
              1  if vertical position traps are enabled, 0 oth-
              erwise.

       \n[.warn]
              The sum of the numbers associated  with  each  of
              the currently enabled warnings.  The number asso-
              ciated with each warning is listed in troff(1).

       \n[.x] The major version number.  For  example,  if  the
              version number is 1.03, then \n[.x] contains 1.

       \n[.y] The  minor  version  number.  For example, if the
              version number is 1.03, then \n[.y] contains  03.

       \n[.Y] The revision number of groff.

       \n[.zoom]
              The  zoom value of the current font, in multiples
              of 1/1000th.  Zero if no magnification.

       \n[llx]
              \n[lly] \n[urx] \n[ury] These four registers  are
              set  by the psbb request and contain the bounding
              box values (in PostScript units) of a given Post-
              Script image.

       The  following  read/write  registers  are set by the \w
       escape sequence:

       \n[rst]
              \n[rsb] Like the st and sb  registers,  but  take
              account of the heights and depths of glyphs.

       \n[ssc]
              The  amount  of  horizontal space (possibly nega-
              tive) that should be  added  to  the  last  glyph
              before a subscript.

       \n[skw]
              How  far to right of the center of the last glyph
              in the \w argument, the center of an accent  from
              a roman font should be placed over that glyph.

       Other available read/write number registers are:

       \n[c.] The current input line number.  \n[.c] is a read-
              only alias to this register.

       \n[hours]
              The number of hours past  midnight.   Initialized
              at start-up.

       \n[hp] The current horizontal position at input line.

       \n[minutes]
              The  number  of minutes after the hour.  Initial-
              ized at start-up.

       \n[seconds]
              The number of seconds after the minute.  Initial-
              ized at start-up.

       \n[systat]
              The  return  value  of the system() function exe-
              cuted by the last sy request.

       \n[slimit]
              If greater than 0, the maximum number of  objects
              on  the input stack.  If less than or equal to 0,
              there is no limit on the number of objects on the
              input  stack.   With no limit, recursion can con-
              tinue until virtual memory is exhausted.

       \n[year]
              The current  year.   Note  that  the  traditional
              troff  number register \n[yr] is the current year
              minus 1900.

   Miscellaneous
       troff predefines a single (read/write) string-based reg-
       ister,  \*[.T], which contains the argument given to the
       -T command line option, namely the current output device
       (for  example,  latin1 or ascii).  Note that this is not
       the same as the (read-only) number register \n[.T] which
       is  defined  to be 1 if troff is called with the -T com-
       mand line option, and zero otherwise.  This behaviour is
       different to UNIX troff.

       Fonts  not  listed  in  the  DESC file are automatically
       mounted on the next available font  position  when  they
       are  referenced.   If a font is to be mounted explicitly
       with the fp request  on  an  unused  font  position,  it
       should  be  mounted  on  the first unused font position,
       which can be found in  the  \n[.fp]  register;  although
       troff  does not enforce this strictly, it does not allow
       a font to be mounted at a position whose number is  much
       greater than that of any currently used position.

       Interpolating  a  string  does  not  hide existing macro
       arguments.  Thus in a macro, a  more  efficient  way  of
       doing

              .xx \\$@

       is

              \\*[xx]\\

       If  the  font description file contains pairwise kerning
       information, glyphs from that font are kerned.   Kerning
       between  two  glyphs  can  be  inhibited by placing a \&
       between them.

       In a string comparison in a condition,  characters  that
       appear  at different input levels to the first delimiter
       character are not recognized  as  the  second  or  third
       delimiters.   This applies also to the tl request.  In a
       \w escape sequence, a character that appears at  a  dif-
       ferent  input  level to the starting delimiter character
       is not recognized as the  closing  delimiter  character.
       The same is true for \A, \b, \B, \C, \l, \L, \o, \X, and
       \Z.  When decoding a macro or string  argument  that  is
       delimited  by double quotes, a character that appears at
       a different input level to the starting delimiter  char-
       acter is not recognized as the closing delimiter charac-
       ter.  The implementation of \$@ ensures that the  double
       quotes  surrounding an argument appear at the same input
       level, which is different to  the  input  level  of  the
       argument  itself.  In a long escape name ] is not recog-
       nized as a closing delimiter except when  it  occurs  at
       the same input level as the opening ].  In compatibility
       mode, no attention is paid to the input-level.

       There are some new types of condition:

       .if rxxx
              True if there is a number register named xxx.

       .if dxxx
              True if there is a string, macro,  diversion,  or
              request named xxx.

       .if mxxx
              True if there is a color named xxx.

       .if cch
              True if there is a character (or glyph) ch avail-
              able; ch is either an ASCII character or a  glyph
              (special  character) \N'xxx', \(xx or \[xxx]; the
              condition is also true if ch has been defined  by
              the char request.

       .if Ff True if font f exists.  f is handled as if it was
              opened with the ft request (this is, font  trans-
              lation  and styles are applied), without actually
              mounting it.

       .if Ss True if style s has been registered.  Font trans-
              lation is applied.

       The tr request can now map characters onto \~.

       The  space  width  emitted  by  the  \|  and  \^  escape
       sequences can be controlled on  a  per-font  basis.   If
       there  is a glyph named \| or \^, respectively (note the
       leading backslash), defined in the  current  font  file,
       use this glyph's width instead of the default value.

       It  is now possible to have whitespace between the first
       and second dot (or the name of the ending macro) to  end
       a macro definition.  Example:

              .if t \{\ .  de bar .    nop Hello, I'm `bar'.  .
              .  .\}

INTERMEDIATE OUTPUT FORMAT
       This section describes the format output by  GNU  troff.
       The  output  format used by GNU troff is very similar to
       that used by Unix device-independent  troff.   Only  the
       differences are documented here.

   Units
       The argument to the s command is in scaled points (units
       of points/n, where n is the argument  to  the  sizescale
       command   in  the  DESC  file).   The  argument  to  the
       x Height command is also in scaled points.

   Text Commands
       Nn     Print glyph with index n (a non-negative integer)
              of the current font.

       If  the tcommand line is present in the DESC file, troff
       uses the following two commands.

       txxx   xxx is any sequence of characters terminated by a
              space  or  a newline (to be more precise, it is a
              sequence of glyphs which are  accessed  with  the
              corresponding  characters);  the  first character
              should be printed at the  current  position,  the
              current  horizontal  position should be increased
              by the width of the first character,  and  so  on
              for  each  character.   The width of the glyph is
              that given in the font file, appropriately scaled
              for  the  current point size, and rounded so that
              it is a multiple of  the  horizontal  resolution.
              Special  characters  cannot be printed using this
              command.

       un xxx This is same as the t command except  that  after
              printing  each  character, the current horizontal
              position is increased by the sum of the width  of
              that character and n.

       Note that single characters can have the eighth bit set,
       as can the names of fonts and special characters.

       The names of  glyphs  and  fonts  can  be  of  arbitrary
       length; drivers should not assume that they are only two
       characters long.

       When a glyph is to be printed, that glyph is  always  in
       the  current  font.  Unlike device-independent troff, it
       is not necessary for drivers to search special fonts  to
       find a glyph.

       For color support, some new commands have been added:

       mc cyan magenta yellow
              md  mg  gray  mk cyan magenta yellow black mr red
              green blue Set the color components of  the  cur-
              rent  drawing color, using various color schemes.
              md resets the drawing color to the default value.
              The  arguments  are  integers  in  the range 0 to
              65536.

       The x device control command has been extended.

       x u n  If n is 1, start underlining  of  spaces.   If  n
              is 0, stop underlining of spaces.  This is needed
              for the cu request in nroff mode and  is  ignored
              otherwise.

   Drawing Commands
       The  D  drawing command has been extended.  These exten-
       sions are not used by GNU pic if the -n option is given.

       Df n\n Set  the  shade  of  gray  to be used for filling
              solid objects to n; n must be an integer  between
              0  and  1000, where 0 corresponds solid white and
              1000 to solid black, and values in between corre-
              spond  to  intermediate  shades  of  gray.   This
              applies only to solid circles, solid ellipses and
              solid  polygons.   By default, a level of 1000 is
              used.  Whatever color  a  solid  object  has,  it
              should  completely obscure everything beneath it.
              A value greater than 1000 or less than 0 can also
              be  used:  this means fill with the shade of gray
              that is currently being used for lines and  text.
              Normally this is black, but some drivers may pro-
              vide a way of changing this.

              The corresponding \D'f...'  command shouldn't  be
              used  since  its argument is always rounded to an
              integer multiple  of  the  horizontal  resolution
              which can lead to surprising results.

       DC d\n Draw a solid circle with a diameter of d with the
              leftmost point at the current position.

       DE dx dy\n
              Draw a solid ellipse with a  horizontal  diameter
              of  dx  and  a  vertical  diameter of dy with the
              leftmost point at the current position.

       Dp dx1 dy1 dx2 dy2 ... dxn dyn\n
              Draw a polygon with, for  i=1,...,n+1,  the  i-th
              vertex at the current position +j=1(dxj,dyj).  At
              the moment, GNU pic only  uses  this  command  to
              generate triangles and rectangles.

       DP dx1 dy1 dx2 dy2 ... dxn dyn\n
              Like  Dp  but  draw  a solid rather than outlined
              polygon.

       Dt n\n Set the  current  line  thickness  to  n  machine
              units.   Traditionally  Unix  troff drivers use a
              line thickness proportional to the current  point
              size; drivers should continue to do this if no Dt
              command has been given, or if a  Dt  command  has
              been  given  with  a negative value of n.  A zero
              value of n selects the  smallest  available  line
              thickness.

       A  difficulty  arises in how the current position should
       be changed after the execution of these commands.   This
       is  not  of great importance since the code generated by
       GNU pic does not depend on this.  Given a  drawing  com-
       mand of the form

              \D'c x1 y1 x2 y2 ... xn yn'

       where  c  is  not  one  of  c, e, l, a, or ~, Unix troff
       treats each of the xi as a horizontal quantity, and each
       of  the  yi  as a vertical quantity and assumes that the
       width of the drawn object is i=1xi, and that the  height
       is  i=1yi.  (The assumption about the height can be seen
       by examining the st and sb registers after using such  a
       D  command  in  a  \w  escape sequence).  This rule also
       holds for all the original  drawing  commands  with  the
       exception  of  De.   For  the  sake of compatibility GNU
       troff also follows this rule, even though it produces an
       ugly  result  in  the  case  of the Dt and Df, and, to a
       lesser extent, DE  commands.   Thus  after  executing  a
       D command of the form

              Dc x1 y1 x2 y2 ... xn yn\n

       the    current   position   should   be   increased   by
       (i=1xi,i=1yi).

       Another set of extensions is

       DFc cyan magenta yellow\n
              DFd\n DFg gray\n DFk cyan magenta yellow  black\n
              DFr  red green blue\n Set the color components of
              the filling  color  similar  to  the  m  commands
              above.

       The  current position isn't changed by those colour com-
       mands (contrary to Df).

   Device Control Commands
       There is a continuation  convention  which  permits  the
       argument  to  the  x X command to contain newlines: when
       outputting the argument to the x X  command,  GNU  troff
       follows  each newline in the argument with a + character
       (as usual, it terminates the entire argument with a new-
       line);  thus  if  the line after the line containing the
       x X command starts with +, then the newline  ending  the
       line  containing  the  x X  command should be treated as
       part of the argument to the x X command, the + should be
       ignored, and the part of the line following the + should
       be treated like the part of the line following  the  x X
       command.

       The first three output commands are guaranteed to be:

              x T device
              x res n h v
              x init

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       In spite of the many extensions, groff has retained com-
       patibility to classical troff to a  large  degree.   For
       the  cases  where  the  extensions lead to collisions, a
       special compatibility  mode  with  the  restricted,  old
       functionality was created for groff.

   Groff Language
       groff  provides  a  compatibility  mode  that  allows to
       process roff code written for  classical  troff  or  for
       other implementations of roff in a consistent way.

       Compatibility  mode can be turned on with the -C command
       line option, and turned on or off with the .cp  request.
       The  number register \n(.C is 1 if compatibility mode is
       on, 0 otherwise.

       This became necessary because the GNU concept  for  long
       names  causes  some  incompatibilities.  Classical troff
       interprets

              .dsabcd

       as defining a string ab  with  contents  cd.   In  groff
       mode,  this  is  considered  as  a call of a macro named
       dsabcd.

       Also classical troff interprets \*[ or \n[ as references
       to  a  string  or  number  register called [ while groff
       takes this as the start of a long name.

       In compatibility mode, groff interprets these things  in
       the traditional way; so long names are not recognized.

       On  the  other  hand,  groff in GNU native mode does not
       allow to use  the  single-character  escapes  \\  (back-
       slash),  \|  (vertical bar), \^ (caret), \& (ampersand),
       \{ (opening brace), \} (closing brace), `\ ' (space), \'
       (single  quote),  \` (backquote), \- (minus), \_ (under-
       line), \! (bang), \% (percent), and \c (character c)  in
       names  of strings, macros, diversions, number registers,
       fonts or environments, whereas classical troff does.

       The \A escape sequence can be helpful in avoiding  these
       escape sequences in names.

       Fractional  point  sizes cause one noteworthy incompati-
       bility.  In classical  troff,  the  ps  request  ignores
       scale indicators and so

              .ps 10u

       sets  the  point  size  to  10  points, whereas in groff
       native mode the point size is set to 10 scaled points.

       In groff, there  is  a  fundamental  difference  between
       unformatted input characters, and formatted output char-
       acters (glyphs).  Everything that affects how a glyph is
       output  is  stored with the glyph; once a glyph has been
       constructed it is unaffected by any subsequent  requests
       that  are executed, including the bd, cs, tkf, tr, or fp
       requests.

       Normally glyphs are constructed from input characters at
       the  moment immediately before the glyph is added to the
       current output line.  Macros, diversions and strings are
       all,  in  fact,  the  same  type of object; they contain
       lists of input characters and glyphs in any combination.

       Special  characters  can  be both; before being added to
       the output, they act as input entities, afterwards  they
       denote glyphs.

       A  glyph does not behave like an input character for the
       purposes of macro processing; it does not inherit any of
       the  special  properties  that  the input character from
       which it was constructed might have had.  The  following
       example makes things clearer.

              .di x \\\\ .br .di .x

       With  GNU  troff this is printed as \\.  So each pair of
       input backslashes `\\' is turned into  a  single  output
       backslash glyph `\' and the resulting output backslashes
       are not interpreted as escape characters when  they  are
       reread.

       Classical  troff  would interpret them as escape charac-
       ters when they were reread and would end up  printing  a
       single backslash `\'.

       In  GNU,  the  correct way to get a printable version of
       the backslash character `\' is the \(rs escape sequence,
       but classical troff does not provide a clean feature for
       getting a non-syntactical backslash.  A close method  is
       the  printable  version  of the current escape character
       using the \e escape sequence; this works if the  current
       escape character is not redefined.  It works in both GNU
       mode and compatibility mode,  while  dirty  tricks  like
       specifying  a  sequence  of  multiple backslashes do not
       work reliably; for the different handling in diversions,
       macro  definitions, or text mode quickly leads to a con-
       fusion about the necessary number of backslashes.

       To store an escape  sequence  in  a  diversion  that  is
       interpreted  when  the  diversion  is reread, either the
       traditional \! transparent output facility or the new \?
       escape sequence can be used.

   Intermediate Output
       The  groff  intermediate  output format is in a state of
       evolution.  So far it has some incompatibilities, but it
       is  intended  to  establish  a full compatibility to the
       classical troff output format.  Actually  the  following
       incompatibilities exist:

        The positioning after the drawing of the polygons con-
         flicts with the classical definition.

        The intermediate output cannot be  rescaled  to  other
         devices as classical `device-independent' troff did.
