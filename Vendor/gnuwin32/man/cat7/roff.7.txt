NAME
       roff - concepts and history of roff typesetting

DESCRIPTION
       roff  is  the  general name for a set of text formatting
       programs, known under names like troff, nroff,  ditroff,
       groff,  etc.   A  roff  system consists of an extensible
       text formatting language  and  a  set  of  programs  for
       printing  and  converting  to other text formats.  Unix-
       like operating systems distribute a  roff  system  as  a
       core package.

       The  most  common roff system today is the free software
       implementation GNU roff, groff(1).  groff implements the
       look-and-feel  and  functionality of its ancestors, with
       many extensions.

       The ancestry of roff is described  in  section  HISTORY.
       In  this  document,  the  term roff always refers to the
       general class of roff programs, not to the roff  command
       provided in early UNIX systems.

       In  spite  of  its  age,  roff is in wide use today, for
       example, the manual pages on UNIX systems  (man  pages),
       many  software  books,  system documentation, standards,
       and corporate documents are written in roff.   The  roff
       output  for  text  devices  is  still unmatched, and its
       graphical output has the  same  quality  as  other  free
       type-setting  programs  and  is  better than some of the
       commercial systems.

       roff is used  to  format  UNIX  manual  pages,  (or  man
       pages),  the standard documentation system on many UNIX-
       derived operating systems.

       This document describes the history of  the  development
       of  the  roff  system;  some usage aspects common to all
       roff versions, details on the roff  pipeline,  which  is
       usually  hidden  behind front-ends like groff(1); a gen-
       eral overview of the formatting language; some tips  for
       editing  roff  files; and many pointers to further read-
       ings.

HISTORY
       Document formatting by computer dates back to the 1960s.
       The  roff  system  itself is intimately connected to the
       Unix operating system, but its roots go back to the ear-
       lier operating systems CTSS and Multics.

   The Predecessor RUNOFF
       roff's  ancestor  RUNOFF was written in the MAD language
       by Jerry Saltzer for the Compatible Time Sharing  System
       (CTSS),  a  project  of  the  Massachusetts Institute of
       Technology (MIT), in 1963 and 1964 - note that CTSS com-
       mands were all uppercase.

       In  1965,  MIT's  Project MAC teamed with Bell Telephone
       Laboratories (BTL) and General  Electric  to  begin  the
       Multics  system  A command called runoff was written for
       Multics in the late 60s in the  BCPL  language,  by  Bob
       Morris,  Doug  McIlroy, and other members of the Multics
       team.

       Like its CTSS  ancestor,  Multics  runoff  formatted  an
       input  file  consisting  of text and command lines; com-
       mands began with a period and were two letters.   Output
       from  these commands was to terminal devices such as IBM
       Selectric terminals.  Multics runoff had additional fea-
       tures  added, such as the ability to do two-pass format-
       ting; it became the main format for  Multics  documenta-
       tion and text processing.

       BCPL  and  runoff were ported to the GCOS system at Bell
       Labs when BTL left the development of Multics.

   The Classical nroff/troff System
       At BTL, there was a need to drive  the  Graphic  Systems
       CAT  typesetter, a graphical output device from a PDP-11
       computer running Unix.  As runoff was  too  limited  for
       this  task it was further developed into a more powerful
       text formatting system by Joseph F. Ossanna, who already
       programmed several runoff ports.

       The  name  runoff  was  shortened  to roff.  The greatly
       enlarged language of Ossanna's version already  included
       all  elements  of  a  full roff system.  All modern roff
       systems try to implement compatibility to  this  system.
       So Joe Ossanna can be called the father of all roff sys-
       tems.

       This first roff system had three formatter programs.

       troff  (typesetter roff) generated  a  graphical  output
              for the CAT typesetter as its only device.

       nroff  produced  text  output suitable for terminals and
              line printers.

       roff   was the reimplementation  of  the  former  runoff
              program  with  its limited features; this program
              was abandoned in later versions.  Today, the name
              roff is used to refer to a troff/nroff sytem as a
              whole.

       Ossanna's first version was written in the PDP-11 assem-
       bly  language  and  released  in  1973.  Brian Kernighan
       joined the roff  development  by  rewriting  it  in  the
       C  programming  language.  The C version was released in
       1975.

       The syntax of the formatting language of the nroff/troff
       programs  was documented in the famous Troff User's Man-
       ual [CSTR #54], first published in  1976,  with  further
       revisions  up to 1992 by Brian Kernighan.  This document
       is the specification of the classical troff.  All  later
       roff  systems tried to establish compatibility with this
       specification.

       After Ossanna's death in 1977, Kernighan  went  on  with
       developing troff.  In the late 1970s, Kernighan equipped
       troff with a general interface to support more  devices,
       the  intermediate  output  format, and the postprocessor
       system.  This completed the structure of a  roff  system
       as it is still in use today; see section USING ROFF.  In
       1979,  these  novelties  were  described  in  the  paper
       [CSTR #97].  This new troff version is the basis for all
       existing newer troff systems, including groff.  On  some
       systems,  this  device independent troff got a binary of
       its own, called ditroff(7).  All modern  troff  programs
       already  provide the full ditroff capabilities automati-
       cally.

   Availability
       The source code of both the ancient Unix  and  classical
       troff  weren't available for two decades.  Meanwhile, it
       is accessible again (on-line)  for  non-commercial  use,
       cf. section SEE ALSO.

   Free roff
       The  most important free roff project was the GNU imple-
       mentation of troff, written from scratch by James  Clark
       and put under the GNU Public License It was called groff
       (GNU roff).  See groff(1) for an overview.

       The groff system is still  actively  developed.   It  is
       compatible  to  the classical troff, but many extensions
       were added.  It is the first roff system that is  avail-
       able  on  almost all operating systems - and it is free.
       This makes groff the de-facto roff standard today.

       An alternative is Gunnar Ritter's Heirloom Documentation
       Tools  project, started in 2005, which provides enhanced
       versions of the various roff tools found in the  OpenSo-
       laris  and Plan 9 operating systems, now available under
       free licenses.

USING ROFF
       Most people won't even notice  that  they  are  actually
       using  roff.   When  you  read a system manual page (man
       page) roff is working in the background.  roff documents
       can  be viewed with a native viewer called xditview(1x),
       a standard program of the  X  window  distribution,  see
       X(7x).    But  using  roff  explicitly  isn't  difficult
       either.

       Some roff implementations provide wrapper programs  that
       make it easy to use the roff system on the shell command
       line.  For example, the GNU roff implementation groff(1)
       provides  command line options to avoid the long command
       pipes of classical troff; a  program  grog(1)  tries  to
       guess  from  the document which arguments should be used
       for a run of groff; people who do  not  like  specifying
       command  line  options should try the groffer(1) program
       for graphically displaying groff files and man pages.

   The roff Pipe
       Each roff system consists of preprocessors, roff format-
       ter  programs, and a set of device postprocessors.  This
       concept makes heavy use of the  piping  mechanism,  that
       is,  a series of programs is called one after the other,
       where the output of each program in the queue  is  taken
       as the input for the next program.

              cat  file | ... | preproc | ... | troff options |
              postproc

       The preprocessors generate roff code that is fed into  a
       roff  formatter  (e.g.  troff),  which in turn generates
       intermediate output that is fed into a  device  postpro-
       cessor program for printing or final output.

       All  of  these  parts use programming languages of their
       own; each language is totally  unrelated  to  the  other
       parts.  Moreover, roff macro packages that were tailored
       for special purposes can be included.

       Most roff documents use  the  macros  of  some  package,
       intermixed  with  code  for  one  or more preprocessors,
       spiced with some elements from the plain roff  language.
       The full power of the roff formatting language is seldom
       needed by users; only programmers of macro packages need
       to know about the gory details.

   Preprocessors
       A roff preprocessor is any program that generates output
       that syntactically obeys the rules of the  roff  format-
       ting  language.  Each preprocessor defines a language of
       its own that is  translated  into  roff  code  when  run
       through  the  preprocessor  program.   Parts  written in
       these languages may be included within a roff  document;
       they  are identified by special roff requests or macros.
       Each document that is enhanced by preprocessor code must
       be run through all corresponding preprocessors before it
       is fed into the actual roff formatter program,  for  the
       formatter just ignores all alien code.  The preprocessor
       programs extract and transform only the  document  parts
       that are determined for them.

       There  are  a lot of free and commercial roff preproces-
       sors.  Some of them aren't available on each system, but
       there  is  a small set of preprocessors that are consid-
       ered as an integral part of each roff system.  The clas-
       sical preprocessors are

              tbl      for tables.
              eqn      for mathematical formulæ.
              pic      for drawing diagrams.
              refer    for bibliographic references.
              soelim   for including macro files from standard locations.
              chem     for drawing chemical formulæ.

       Other  known preprocessors that are not available on all
       systems include

              grap   for constructing graphical elements.
              grn    for including gremlin(1) pictures.

   Formatter Programs
       A roff formatter is  a  program  that  parses  documents
       written  in the roff formatting language or uses some of
       the roff macro packages.  It generates intermediate out-
       put,  which  is  intended to be fed into a single device
       postprocessor that must be specified by  a  command-line
       option  to  the  formatter  program.  The documents must
       have  been  run  through  all  necessary   preprocessors
       before.

       The  output  produced by a roff formatter is represented
       in yet another language, the intermediate output  format
       or  troff  output.  This language was first specified in
       [CSTR  #97];  its  GNU  extension   is   documented   in
       groff_out(5).   The  intermediate  output  language is a
       kind of assembly language  compared  to  the  high-level
       roff  language.   The  generated  intermediate output is
       optimized for a special device, but the language is  the
       same for every device.

       The roff formatter is the heart of the roff system.  The
       traditional roff had  two  formatters,  nroff  for  text
       devices and troff for graphical devices.

       Often, the name troff is used as a general term to refer
       to both formatters.

   Devices and Postprocessors
       Devices are hardware interfaces like printers,  text  or
       graphical  terminals,  etc., or software interfaces such
       as a conversion into a different text or graphical  for-
       mat.

       A  roff postprocessor is a program that transforms troff
       output into a form suitable for a special  device.   The
       roff postprocessors are like device drivers for the out-
       put target.

       For each device there is a  postprocessor  program  that
       fits the device optimally.  The postprocessor parses the
       generated intermediate output and generates  device-spe-
       cific code that is sent directly to the device.

       The  names of the devices and the postprocessor programs
       are not fixed because they greatly depend on  the  soft-
       ware and hardware abilities of the actual computer.  For
       example, the classical devices mentioned in  [CSTR  #54]
       have greatly changed since the classical times.  The old
       hardware doesn't exist any longer and the old  graphical
       conversions  were quite imprecise when compared to their
       modern counterparts.

       For example, the Postscript  device  post  in  classical
       troff  had  a  resolution  of  720 units per inch, while
       groff's ps device has 72000, a refinement of factor 100.

       Today  the  operating systems provide device drivers for
       most printer-like hardware, so  it  isn't  necessary  to
       write a special hardware postprocessor for each printer.

ROFF PROGRAMMING
       Documents using roff are normal text files decorated  by
       roff  formatting elements.  The roff formatting language
       is quite powerful; it is almost a full programming  lan-
       guage  and  provides  elements  to enlarge the language.
       With these, it became possible to develop macro packages
       that  are tailored for special applications.  Such macro
       packages are much handier than plain roff.  So most peo-
       ple  will  choose a macro package without worrying about
       the internals of the roff language.

   Macro Packages
       Macro packages are collections of macros that are  suit-
       able  to  format a special kind of documents in a conve-
       nient way.  This greatly eases the usage of  roff.   The
       macro definitions of a package are kept in a file called
       name.tmac (classically tmac.name).  All tmac  files  are
       stored  in one or more directories at standardized posi-
       tions.  Details on the  naming  of  macro  packages  and
       their placement is found in groff_tmac(5).

       A  macro package that is to be used in a document can be
       announced to the formatter by the  command  line  option
       -m,  see troff(1), or it can be specified within a docu-
       ment using the file inclusion requests of the roff  lan-
       guage, see groff(7).

       Famous  classical macro packages are man for traditional
       man pages, mdoc for BSD-style manual  pages;  the  macro
       sets  for  books, articles, and letters are me (probably
       from the first name of  its  creator  Eric  Allman),  ms
       (from   Manuscript  Macros),  and  mm  (from  Memorandum
       Macros).

   The roff Formatting Language
       The classical roff formatting language is documented  in
       the  Troff  User's Manual [CSTR #54].  The roff language
       is a full programming language providing requests, defi-
       nition  of  macros,  escape sequences, string variables,
       number or size registers, and flow controls.

       Requests are the predefined  basic  formatting  commands
       similar  to  the commands at the shell prompt.  The user
       can define request-like elements using  predefined  roff
       elements.   These  are  then  called macros.  A document
       writer  will  not  note  any  difference  in  usage  for
       requests  or macros; both are written on a line on their
       own starting with a dot.

       Escape sequences are roff elements starting with a back-
       slash  `\'.   They can be inserted anywhere, also in the
       midst of text in a line.  They  are  used  to  implement
       various  features,  including the insertion of non-ASCII
       characters with \(, font changes with \f,  in-line  com-
       ments  with  \", the escaping of special control charac-
       ters like \\, and many other features.

       Strings are variables that can store a string.  A string
       is  stored by the .ds request.  The stored string can be
       retrieved later by the \* escape sequence.

       Registers store numbers and sizes.  A  register  can  be
       set  with the request .nr and its value can be retrieved
       by the escape sequence \n.

FILE NAME EXTENSIONS
       Manual pages (man pages) take the section  number  as  a
       file  name  extension, e.g., the filename for this docu-
       ment is roff.7, i.e., it is kept in section 7 of the man
       pages.

       The classical macro packages take the package name as an
       extension, e.g. file.me for  a  document  using  the  me
       macro  package, file.mm for mm, file.ms for ms, file.pic
       for pic files, etc.

       But there is no general naming  scheme  for  roff  docu-
       ments,  though  file.tr  for  troff file is seen now and
       then.  Maybe there should be a standardization  for  the
       filename extensions of roff files.

       File  name  extensions  can be very handy in conjunction
       with the less(1) pager.  It provides the possibility  to
       feed  all  input into a command-line pipe that is speci-
       fied in the shell environment variable  LESSOPEN.   This
       process is not well documented, so here an example:

              LESSOPEN='|lesspipe %s'

       where  lesspipe is either a system supplied command or a
       shell script of your own.

EDITING ROFF
       The best program for editing a roff  document  is  Emacs
       (or  Xemacs),  see  emacs(1).  It provides an nroff mode
       that is suitable for all kinds of roff  dialects.   This
       mode can be activated by the following methods.

       When editing a file within Emacs the mode can be changed
       by typing `M-x nroff-mode', where M-x means to hold down
       the  Meta key (or Alt) and hitting the x key at the same
       time.

       But it is also possible to have the  mode  automatically
       selected when the file is loaded into the editor.

       ·      The most general method is to include the follow-
              ing 3 comment lines at the end of the file.

                     .\" Local Variables: .\" mode:  nroff  .\"
                     End:

       ·      There  is a set of file name extensions, e.g. the
              man pages that trigger the  automatic  activation
              of the nroff mode.

       ·      Theoretically,   it  is  possible  to  write  the
              sequence

                     .\" -*- nroff -*-

              as the first line of a file to have it started in
              nroff  mode  when  loaded.   Unfortunately,  some
              applications such as the man program are confused
              by this; so this is deprecated.

       All  roff  formatters  provide automated line breaks and
       horizontal and vertical spacing.  In order to  not  dis-
       turb this, the following tips can be helpful.

       ·      Never include empty or blank lines in a roff doc-
              ument.  Instead, use the empty  request  (a  line
              consisting  of  a dot only) or a line comment .\"
              if a structuring element is needed.

       ·      Never start a line with whitespace  because  this
              can  lead to unexpected behavior.  Indented para-
              graphs can be constructed in a controlled way  by
              roff requests.

       ·      Start each sentence on a line of its own, for the
              spacing  after  a  dot  is  handled   differently
              depending  on  whether it terminates an abbrevia-
              tion or a sentence.  To distinguish  both  cases,
              do a line break after each sentence.

       ·      To  additionally use the auto-fill mode in Emacs,
              it is best to insert an  empty  roff  request  (a
              line  consisting  of  a dot only) after each sen-
              tence.

       The following example shows  how  optimal  roff  editing
       could look.

              This  is  an  example  for a .I roff document.  .
              This is the next sentence in the same  paragraph.
              .  This is a longer sentence stretching over sev-
              eral lines; abbreviations like `cf.'  are  easily
              identified  because  the dot is not followed by a
              line break.  .  In the output, this will still go
              to the same paragraph.

       Besides  Emacs,  some  other editors provide nroff style
       files too, e.g. vim(1), an extension of the  vi(1)  pro-
       gram.

SEE ALSO
       There  is  a lot of documentation on roff.  The original
       papers on classical troff are still available,  and  all
       aspects of groff are documented in great detail.

              and pointers to all historical aspects of roff.

       Multics
              The Multics site contains a lot of information on
              the  MIT  projects,  CTSS,  Multics,  early Unix,
              including runoff; especially useful are  a  glos-
              sary and the many links to ancient documents.

       Unix Archive
              The  Ancient  Unixes  Archive provides the source
              code and some  binaries  of  the  ancient  Unixes
              (including the source code of troff and its docu-
              mentation) that were made public by Caldera since
              2001,  e.g.  of  the  famous  Unix  version 7 for
              PDP-11 at the Unix V7 site

       Developers at AT&T Bell Labs
              Bell Labs  Computing  and  Mathematical  Sciences
              Research  provides a search facility for tracking
              information on the early developers.

       Plan 9 The Plan 9 operating system by AT&T Bell Labs.

       runoff Jerry Saltzer's home page stores  some  documents
              using the ancient RUNOFF formatting language.

       CSTR Papers
              The Bell Labs CSTR site stores the original troff
              manuals (CSTR #54, #97,  #114,  #116,  #122)  and
              famous historical documents on programming.

       GNU roff
              The  groff web site provides the free roff imple-
              mentation groff, the actual standard roff.

   Historical roff Documentation
       Many classical troff documents are still  available  on-
       line.  The two main manuals of the troff language are

       [CSTR #54]
              J.  F.  Ossanna,  Nroff/Troff  User's Manual Bell
              Labs, 1976; revised by Brian Kernighan, 1992.

       [CSTR #97]
              Brian Kernighan, A  Typesetter-independent  TROFF
              Bell Labs, 1981, revised March 1982.

       The "little language" roff papers are

       [CSTR #114]
              Jon  L.  Bentley and Brian W. Kernighan, GRAP - A
              Language for Typesetting Graphs Bell Labs, August
              1984.

       [CSTR #116]
              Brian W. Kernighan, PIC - A Graphics Language for
              Typesetting Bell Labs, December 1984.

       [CSTR #122]
              J.  L.  Bentley,  L.  W.  Jelinski,  and  B.   W.
              Kernighan, CHEM - A Program for Typesetting Chem-
              ical Structure Diagrams, Computers and  Chemistry
              Bell Labs, April 1986.

   Manual Pages
       Due  to  its  complex  structure, a full roff system has
       many man pages, each describing a single aspect of roff.
       Unfortunately, there is no general naming scheme for the
       documentation among the different roff  implementations.

       In groff, the man page groff(1) contains a survey of all
       documentation available in groff.

       On other systems, you are  on  your  own,  but  troff(1)
       might be a good starting point.
