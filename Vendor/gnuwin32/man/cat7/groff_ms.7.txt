NAME
       groff_ms - groff ms macros

SYNOPSIS
       groff -ms [ options... ] [ files... ]
       groff -m ms [ options... ] [ files... ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  describes  the GNU version of the ms
       macros, part of the groff typesetting  system.   The  ms
       macros  are mostly compatible with the documented behav-
       ior of the 4.3 BSD Unix ms macros (see Differences  from
       troff ms below for details).  The ms macros are suitable
       for reports, letters, books,  and  technical  documenta-
       tion.

USAGE
       The  ms  macro  package  expects files to have a certain
       amount of structure.  The simplest documents  can  begin
       with  a paragraph macro and consist of text separated by
       paragraph macros or even blank lines.  Longer  documents
       have a structure as follows:

       Document type
              If you use the RP (report) macro at the beginning
              of the document,  groff  prints  the  cover  page
              information  on its own page; otherwise it prints
              the information on the first page with your docu-
              ment  text immediately following.  Other document
              formats found in AT&T troff are specific to  AT&T
              or Berkeley, and are not supported in groff ms.

       Format and layout
              By  setting number registers, you can change your
              document's type (font and size),  margins,  spac-
              ing,  headers  and  footers,  and footnotes.  See
              Document  control  registers   below   for   more
              details.

       Cover page
              A  cover page consists of a title, and optionally
              the author's name and institution,  an  abstract,
              and  the  date.   See Cover page macros below for
              more details.

       Body   Following the cover page is  your  document.   It
              consists of paragraphs, headings, and lists.

       Table of contents
              Longer  documents usually include a table of con-
              tents, which you can add by placing the TC  macro
              at the end of your document.

   Document control registers
       The  following  table  lists the document control number
       registers.  For the sake of consistency,  set  registers
       related to margins at the beginning of your document, or
       just after the RP macro.

   Cover page macros
       Use the following macros to create a cover page for your
       document in the order shown.

       .RP [no]
              Specifies  the  report  format for your document.
              The report format creates a separate cover  page.
              With  no  RP  macro, groff prints a subset of the
              cover page on page 1 of your document.

              If you use the optional no argument, groff prints
              a title page but does not repeat any of the title
              page information (title, author, abstract,  etc.)
              on page 1 of the document.

       .P1    (P-one) Prints the header on page 1.  The default
              is to suppress the header.

       .DA [xxx]
              (optional) Print the current date, or  the  argu-
              ments  to the macro if any, on the title page (if
              specified) and  in  the  footers.   This  is  the
              default for nroff.

       .ND [xxx]
              (optional)  Print  the current date, or the argu-
              ments to the macro if any, on the title page  (if
              specified)  but  not in the footers.  This is the
              default for troff.

       .TL    Specifies the  document  title.   Groff  collects
              text following the TL macro into the title, until
              reaching the author name or abstract.

       .AU    Specifies the author's  name.   You  can  specify
              multiple  authors  by  using an AU macro for each
              author.

       .AI    Specifies  the  author's  institution.   You  can
              specify multiple institutions.

       .AB [no]
              Begins the abstract.  The default is to print the
              word ABSTRACT, centered and in italics, above the
              text  of  the abstract.  The option no suppresses
              this heading.

       .AE    End the abstract.

   Paragraphs
       Use the PP macro to create indented paragraphs, and  the
       LP macro to create paragraphs with no initial indent.

       The  QP  macro  indents  all text at both left and right
       margins.  The effect is identical to  the  HTML  <BLOCK-
       QUOTE>  element.   The next paragraph or heading returns
       margins to normal.

       The XP macro produces an exdented paragraph.  The  first
       line  of  the  paragraph  begins at the left margin, and
       subsequent lines are indented (the opposite of PP).

       For each of the above paragraph types, and also for  any
       list entry introduced by the IP macro (described later),
       the document control register PORPHANS, sets the minimum
       number  of  lines which must be printed, after the start
       of the paragraph, and before any page break occurs.   If
       there  is  insufficient  space  remaining on the current
       page to accommodate this number of lines,  then  a  page
       break  is  forced before the first line of the paragraph
       is printed.

       Similarly, when a section heading (see subsection  Head-
       ings  below)  preceeds any of these paragraph types, the
       HORPHANS document control register specifies the minimum
       number  of  lines of the paragraph which must be kept on
       the same page as the  heading.   If  insufficient  space
       remains  on  the current page to accommodate the heading
       and this number of lines of paragraph text, then a  page
       break is forced before the heading is printed.

   Headings
       Use headings to create a hierarchical structure for your
       document.  By default, the ms macros print  headings  in
       bold  using  the  same font family and point size as the
       body text.  For output devices  which  support  scalable
       fonts,  this  behaviour may be modified, by defining the
       document control registers, GROWPS and PSINCR.

       The following heading macros are available:

       .NH xx Numbered heading.  The argument xx  is  either  a
              numeric  argument  to  indicate  the level of the
              heading, or S xx xx "..."   to  set  the  section
              number explicitly.  If you specify heading levels
              out of sequence, such  as  invoking  .NH 3  after
              .NH 1,  groff prints a warning on standard error.

              If the GROWPS register is set to a value  greater
              than  the  level  of  the heading, then the point
              size of the heading will be increased  by  PSINCR
              units over the text size specified by the PS reg-
              ister, for each level by which the heading  level
              is  less  than the value of GROWPS.  For example,
              the sequence:

                     .nr PS 10
                     .nr GROWPS 3
                     .nr PSINCR 1.5p
                     .
                     .NH 1
                     Top Level Heading
                     .
                     .NH 2
                     Second Level Heading
                     .
                     .NH 3
                     Third Level Heading

              will cause "1. Top Level Heading" to  be  printed
              in   13pt   bold  text,  followed  by  "1.1. Sec-
              ond Level Heading" in  11.5pt  bold  text,  while
              "1.1.1. Third Level Heading", and all more deeply
              nested heading levels, will remain  in  the  10pt
              bold  text which is specified by the PS register.

              Note that the value stored in  PSINCR  is  inter-
              preted in groff basic units; the p scaling factor
              should be employed, when assigning a value speci-
              fied in points.

              The  style  used to represent the section number,
              within a numbered heading, is controlled  by  the
              SN-STYLE  string;  this  may be set to either the
              SN-DOT or the SN-NO-DOT style, (described below),
              by  aliasing  SN-STYLE  accordingly.  By default,
              SN-STYLE is initialised by defining the alias

                     .als SN-STYLE SN-DOT

              it may be changed to the SN-NO-DOT style, if pre-
              ferred, by defining the alternative alias

                     .als SN-STYLE SN-NO-DOT

              Any  such change becomes effective with the first
              use of .NH, after the new alias is defined.

              After invoking .NH, the assigned  heading  number
              is available in the strings SN-DOT (as it appears
              in the  default  formatting  style  for  numbered
              headings, with a terminating period following the
              number), and  SN-NO-DOT  (with  this  terminating
              period  omitted).  The string SN is also defined,
              as an alias for SN-DOT; if  preferred,  the  user
              may  redefine  it  as  an alias for SN-NO-DOT, by
              including the initialisation:

                     .als SN SN-NO-DOT

              at any time; the change  becomes  effective  with
              the  next  use  of  .NH,  after  the new alias is
              defined.

       .SH [xx]
              Unnumbered subheading.  The use of  the  optional
              xx argument is a GNU extension, which adjusts the
              point size of the unnumbered subheading to  match
              that  of  a  numbered  heading,  introduced using
              .NH xx with the same value of xx.   For  example,
              given  the  same  settings  for  PS,  GROWPS  and
              PSINCR, as used in the  preceeding  .NH  example,
              the sequence:

                     .SH 2
                     An Unnumbered Subheading

              will  print  "An Unnumbered Subheading" in 11.5pt
              bold text.

   Highlighting
       The ms macros provide a variety of methods to  highlight
       or emphasize text:

       .B [txt [post [pre]]]
              Sets  its  first  argument  in bold type.  If you
              specify a second argument, groff prints it in the
              previous font after the bold text, with no inter-
              vening space (this allows you to set  punctuation
              after  the  highlighted text without highlighting
              the punctuation).  Similarly, it prints the third
              argument (if any) in the previous font before the
              first argument.  For example,

                     .B foo ) (

              prints (foo).

              If you give this macro no arguments, groff prints
              all  text  following in bold until the next high-
              lighting, paragraph, or heading macro.

       .R [txt [post [pre]]]
              Sets its first argument  in  roman  (or  regular)
              type.   It operates similarly to the B macro oth-
              erwise.

       .I [txt [post [pre]]]
              Sets its first argument in italic type.  It oper-
              ates similarly to the B macro otherwise.

       .CW [txt [post [pre]]]
              Sets its first argument in a constant width face.
              It operates similarly to the B macro otherwise.

       .BI [txt [post [pre]]]
              Sets its first argument in bold italic type.   It
              operates similarly to the B macro otherwise.

       .BX [txt]
              Prints  its  argument  and draws a box around it.
              If you want to box a string that contains spaces,
              use a digit-width space (\0).

       .UL [txt [post]]
              Prints  its first argument with an underline.  If
              you specify a second argument, groff prints it in
              the previous font after the underlined text, with
              no intervening space.

       .LG    Prints  all  text  following   in   larger   type
              (2  points  larger  than  the current point size)
              until the next  font  size,  highlighting,  para-
              graph,  or  heading  macro.  You can specify this
              macro multiple times to enlarge the point size as
              needed.

       .SM    Prints   all   text  following  in  smaller  type
              (2 points smaller than the  current  point  size)
              until  the  next  type  size, highlighting, para-
              graph, or heading macro.  You  can  specify  this
              macro  multiple times to reduce the point size as
              needed.

       .NL    Prints all text following  in  the  normal  point
              size (that is, the value of the PS register).

       \*{text\*}
              Print the enclosed text as a superscript.

   Indents
       You  may need to indent sections of text.  A typical use
       for indents is to create nested lists and sublists.

       Use the RS and RE macros to start and end a  section  of
       indented  text,  respectively.  The PI register controls
       the amount of indent.

       You can nest indented sections as deeply  as  needed  by
       using multiple, nested pairs of RS and RE.

   Lists
       The  IP  macro handles duties for all lists.  Its syntax
       is as follows:

       .IP [marker [width]]

              The marker is usually a bullet character \(bu for
              unordered  lists,  a number (or auto-incrementing
              number register) for numbered lists, or a word or
              phrase for indented (glossary-style) lists.

              The  width  specifies  the indent for the body of
              each  list  item.   Once  specified,  the  indent
              remains  the same for all list items in the docu-
              ment until specified again.

   Tab stops
       Use the ta request to set tab stops as needed.  Use  the
       TA  macro  to reset tabs to the default (every 5n).  You
       can redefine the TA macro to create a different  set  of
       default tab stops.

   Displays and keeps
       Use  displays  to  show  text-based  examples or figures
       (such as code listings).  Displays turn off filling,  so
       lines  of  code can be displayed as-is without inserting
       br requests in between each line.  Displays can be  kept
       on a single page, or allowed to break across pages.  The
       following table shows the display types available.


       Use the DE macro to end any display type.  The macros Ds
       and  De were formerly provided as aliases for DS and DE,
       respectively, but they have been removed, and should  no
       longer be used.  X11 documents which actually use Ds and
       De always load a specific macro file from the  X11  dis-
       tribution  (macros.t)  which provides proper definitions
       for the two macros.

       To keep text together on a page,  such  as  a  paragraph
       that  refers to a table (or list, or other item) immedi-
       ately following, use the KS and KE macros.  The KS macro
       begins  a block of text to be kept on a single page, and
       the KE macro ends the block.

       You can specify a floating keep  using  the  KF  and  KE
       macros.   If  the  keep  cannot fit on the current page,
       groff holds the contents of the  keep  and  allows  text
       following  the  keep (in the source file) to fill in the
       remainder of the current page.  When  the  page  breaks,
       whether by an explicit bp request or by reaching the end
       of the page, groff prints the floating keep at  the  top
       of  the  new  page.   This  is useful for printing large
       graphics or tables that do not need  to  appear  exactly
       where specified.

       The  macros  B1  and  B2  can  be used to enclose a text
       within a box; .B1 begins the box, and .B2 ends it.  Text
       in  the  box  is  automatically  placed  in  a diversion
       (keep).

   Tables, figures, equations, and references
       The -ms macros support the standard groff preprocessors:
       tbl,  pic,  eqn,  and  refer.   Mark text meant for pre-
       processors by enclosing it in pairs of tags as follows:

       .TS [H] and .TE
              Denotes a table, to be processed by the tbl  pre-
              processor.   The  optional  H  argument instructs
              groff to create a running header with the  infor-
              mation  up  to  the  TH  macro.  Groff prints the
              header at the beginning of the table; if the  ta-
              ble  runs  onto  another  page,  groff prints the
              header on the next page as well.

       .PS and .PE
              Denotes a graphic, to be  processed  by  the  pic
              preprocessor.  You can create a pic file by hand,
              using the AT&T pic manual available on the Web as
              a  reference, or by using a graphics program such
              as xfig.

       .EQ [align] and .EN
              Denotes an equation, to be processed by  the  eqn
              preprocessor.  The optional align argument can be
              C, L, or I to center (the default), left-justify,
              or indent the equation.

       .[ and .]
              Denotes a reference, to be processed by the refer
              preprocessor.  The GNU refer(1) manual page  pro-
              vides a comprehensive reference to the preproces-
              sor and the format of the bibliographic database.

   Footnotes
       The  ms  macros provide a flexible footnote system.  You
       can specify a numbered footnote by using the \** escape,
       followed  by the text of the footnote enclosed by FS and
       FE macros.

       You can specify symbolic footnotes by placing  the  mark
       character (such as \(dg for the dagger character) in the
       body text, followed by the text of the footnote enclosed
       by FS \(dg and FE macros.

       You  can  control  how  groff prints footnote numbers by
       changing the value of the FF register as follows:

              0      Prints the footnote  number  as  a  super-
                     script; indents the footnote (default).

              1      Prints  the  number  followed  by a period
                     (like 1.) and indents the footnote.

              2      Like 1, without an indent.

              3      Like 1, but prints the footnote number  as
                     a hanging paragraph.

       You  can use footnotes safely within keeps and displays,
       but  avoid  using  numbered  footnotes  within  floating
       keeps.   You  can set a second \** between a \** and its
       corresponding .FS; as long as each .FS occurs after  the
       corresponding  \** and the occurrences of .FS are in the
       same order as the corresponding occurrences of \**.

   Headers and footers
       There are three ways to define headers and footers:

         Use the strings LH, CH, and RH to set the left,  cen-
          ter, and right headers; use LF, CF, and RF to set the
          left, center, and right footers.  This works best for
          documents  that  do  not  distinguish between odd and
          even pages.

         Use the OH and EH macros to define  headers  for  the
          odd  and  even  pages; and OF and EF macros to define
          footers for the odd and even  pages.   This  is  more
          flexible  than  defining the individual strings.  The
          syntax for these macros is as follows:

                 .OH 'left'center'right'

          You can replace the quote (') marks with any  charac-
          ter not appearing in the header or footer text.

       You can also redefine the PT and BT macros to change the
       behavior of the header and  footer,  respectively.   The
       header process also calls the (undefined) HD macro after
       PT ; you can define this macro if  you  need  additional
       processing  after  printing  the header (for example, to
       draw a line below the header).

   Margins
       You control margins using a  set  of  number  registers.
       The   following  table  lists  the  register  names  and
       defaults:

              Reg.          Definition             Effective      Default
              ------------------------------------------------------------
              PO     Page offset (left margin)   next page        1i
              LL     Line length                 next paragraph   6i
              LT     Header/footer length        next paragraph   6i
              HM     Top (header) margin         next page        1i
              FM     Bottom (footer) margin      next page        1i
              ------------------------------------------------------------

       Note that there is no right margin setting.  The  combi-
       nation of page offset and line length provide the infor-
       mation necessary to derive the right margin.

   Multiple columns
       The ms macros can set text in as many  columns  as  will
       reasonably  fit  on  the page.  The following macros are
       available.  All of them force a page break if  a  multi-
       column  mode  is  already  set.  However, if the current
       mode is single-column, starting a multi-column mode does
       not force a page break.

       .1C    Single-column mode.

       .2C    Two-column mode.

       .MC [width [gutter]]
              Multi-column  mode.  If you specify no arguments,
              it is equivalent to  the  2C  macro.   Otherwise,
              width  is  the width of each column and gutter is
              the space between columns.  The MINGW number reg-
              ister is the default gutter width.

   Creating a table of contents
       Wrap  text  that you want to appear in the table of con-
       tents in XS and XE macros.  Use the TC  macro  to  print
       the table of contents at the end of the document, reset-
       ting the page number to i (Roman numeral 1).

       You can manually create a table of contents by  specify-
       ing a page number as the first argument to XS.  Add sub-
       sequent entries using the XA macro.  For example:

              .XS 1
              Introduction
              .XA 2
              A Brief History of the Universe
              .XA 729
              Details of Galactic Formation
              ...
              .XE

       Use the PX macro to print a manually-generated table  of
       contents without resetting the page number.

       If  you  give  the argument no to either PX or TC, groff
       suppresses printing the title specified by  the  \*[TOC]
       string.

   Fractional point sizes
       Traditionally, the ms macros only support integer values
       for the document's font size and vertical  spacing.   To
       overcome  this  restriction, values larger than or equal
       to 1000 are taken as fractional  values,  multiplied  by
       1000.  For example, `.nr PS 10250' sets the font size to
       10.25 points.

       The following four  registers  accept  fractional  point
       sizes: PS, VS, FPS, and FVS.

       Due  to backwards compatibility, the value of VS must be
       smaller than 40000 (this is 40.0 points).

DIFFERENCES FROM troff ms
       The groff ms macros are  a  complete  re-implementation,
       using  no original AT&T code.  Since they take advantage
       of the extended features in groff, they cannot  be  used
       with AT&T troff.  Other differences include:

         The  internals  of groff ms differ from the internals
          of Unix ms.  Documents that depend  upon  implementa-
          tion  details of Unix ms may not format properly with
          groff ms.

         The error-handling policy of groff ms  is  to  detect
          and  report  errors,  rather  than silently to ignore
          them.

         Some Bell  Labs  localisms  are  not  implemented  by
          default.   However, if you call the otherwise undocu-
          mented  SC  section-header  macro,  you  will  enable
          implementations  of  three  other  archaic  Bell Labs
          macros: UC, P1, and P2.  These  are  not  enabled  by
          default  because (a) they were not documented, in the
          original ms manual, and (b) the P1 and UC macros both
          collide with different macros in the Berkeley version
          of ms.

          These emulations are sufficient to give back the 1976
          Kernighan  &  Cherry  paper  Typsetting Mathematics -
          User's Guide its section headings, and  restore  some
          text  that had gone missing as arguments of undefined
          macros.  No warranty express or implied is  given  as
          to  how  well  the  typographic details these produce
          match the original Bell Labs macros.

         Berkeley localisms,  in  particular  the  TM  and  CT
          macros, are not implemented.

         Groff  ms  does not work in compatibility mode (e.g.,
          with the -C option).

         There is no support for typewriter-like devices.

         Groff ms does not provide cut marks.

         Multiple line spacing is not supported (use a  larger
          vertical spacing instead).

         Some  Unix  ms  documentation says that the CW and GW
          number registers can be used to  control  the  column
          width  and  gutter width, respectively.  These number
          registers are not used in groff ms.

         Macros that  cause  a  reset  (paragraphs,  headings,
          etc.)  may change the indent.  Macros that change the
          indent do not increment or decrement the indent,  but
          rather  set  it  absolutely.  This can cause problems
          for documents that define additional macros of  their
          own.   The  solution is to use not the in request but
          instead the RS and RE macros.

         The number register GS is set to 1 by  the  groff  ms
          macros, but is not used by the Unix ms macros.  Docu-
          ments that need to determine whether they  are  being
          formatted  with  Unix  ms or groff ms should use this
          number register.

         To make groff ms use the default page  offset  (which
          also specifies the left margin), the PO number regis-
          ter must stay undefined until the first ms  macro  is
          evaluated.   This  implies that PO should not be used
          early in the document, unless  it  is  changed  also:
          Remember  that  accessing an undefined register auto-
          matically defines it.

   Strings
       You can redefine the  following  strings  to  adapt  the
       groff ms macros to languages other than English:

                      String       Default Value
                    -------------------------------
                    REFERENCES   References
                    ABSTRACT     ABSTRACT
                    TOC          Table of Contents

                    MONTH10      October
                    MONTH11      November
                    MONTH12      December
                    -------------------------------

       The \*- string produces an em dash -- like this.

       Use  \*Q  and  \*U to get a left and right typographer's
       quote, respectively,  in  troff  (and  plain  quotes  in
       nroff).


   Text Settings
       The  FAM  string  sets the default font family.  If this
       string is undefined at  initialization,  it  is  set  to
       Times.

       The  point  size,  vertical spacing, and inter-paragraph
       spacing for footnotes are controlled by the number  reg-
       isters  FPS,  FVS,  and FPD; at initialization these are
       set to \n(PS-2, \n[FPS]+2,  and  \n(PD/2,  respectively.
       If any of these registers are defined before initializa-
       tion, the initialization macro does not change them.

       The hyphenation flags (as set by the hy request) are set
       from the HY register; the default is 14.

       Improved  accent  marks (as originally defined in Berke-
       ley's ms version) are available  by  specifying  the  AM
       macro  at the beginning of your document.  You can place
       an accent over most characters by specifying the  string
       defining  the  accent directly after the character.  For
       example, n\*~ produces an n with a tilde over it.

NAMING CONVENTIONS
       The following conventions are used for names of  macros,
       strings  and number registers.  External names available
       to documents that use the groff ms macros  contain  only
       uppercase letters and digits.

       Internally  the  macros are divided into modules; naming
       conventions are as follows:

         Names used only within one module  are  of  the  form
          module*name.

         Names  used  outside  the  module  in  which they are
          defined are of the form module@name.

         Names associated with a particular environment are of
          the form environment:name; these are used only within
          the par module.

         name does not have a module prefix.

         Constructed names used to implement arrays are of the
          form array!index.

       Thus the groff ms macros reserve the following names:

         Names containing the characters *, @, and :.

         Names containing only uppercase letters and digits.
