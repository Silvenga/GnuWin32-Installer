MAN(7)                                                   MAN(7)




NAME
       man - macros to typeset manual

SYNOPSIS
       nroff  -man  file ...

       troff  -man  file ...

DESCRIPTION
       These  macros  are used to lay out pages of this manual.
       A   skeleton   page   may   be   found   in   the   file
       /usr/man/man0/xx.

       Any  text  argument  t may be zero to six words.  Quotes
       may be used to include blanks in a `word'.  If  text  is
       empty,  the  special  treatment  is  applied to the next
       input line with text to be printed.  In this way .I  may
       be used to italicize a whole line, or .SM followed by .B
       to make small bold letters.

       A prevailing indent distance is remembered between  suc-
       cessive  indented  paragraphs,  and  is reset to default
       value upon reaching a non-indented  paragraph.   Default
       units for indents i are ens.

       Type  font  and  size are reset to default values before
       each paragraph, and after processing font and size  set-
       ting macros.

       These strings are predefined by -man:

       \*R    `(Reg)', trademark symbol in troff.

       \*S    Change to default type size.
