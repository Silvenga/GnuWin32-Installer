.SH NAME
btowc \- convert single byte to wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "wint_t btowc (int " c );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbtowc\fP function converts \fIc\fP, interpreted as a multibyte sequence
of length 1, starting in the initial shift state, to a wide character and
returns it. If \fIc\fP is EOF or not a valid multibyte sequence of length 1,
the \fBbtowc\fP function returns WEOF.
.PP
Never use this function. It cannot help you in writing internationalized
programs. Internationalized programs must never support single-byte
representations in a special way.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBbtowc\fP function returns the wide character converted from the single
byte \fIc\fP. If \fIc\fP is EOF or not a valid multibyte sequence of length 1,
it returns WEOF.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR mbtowc (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBbtowc\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
.PP
This function should never be used. It does not work for encodings which have
state, and unnecessarily treats single bytes differently from multibyte
sequences. Use the function \fBmbtowc\fP instead.
