.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBwcscspn\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the \fBstrcspn\fP
function. It determines the length of the longest initial segment of \fIwcs\fP
which consists entirely of wide-characters not listed in \fIreject\fP. In
other words, it searches for the first occurrence in the wide-character
string \fIwcs\fP of any of the characters in the wide-character string
\fIreject\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBwcscspn\fP function returns the number of wide characters in the longest
initial segment of \fIwcs\fP which consists entirely of wide-characters not
listed in \fIreject\fP. In other words, it returns the position of the first
occurrence in the wide-character string \fIwcs\fP of any of the characters in
the wide-character string \fIreject\fP, or \fIwcslen(wcs)\fP if there is none.
