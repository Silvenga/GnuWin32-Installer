.SH NAME
iswcntrl \- test for control wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "int iswcntrl (wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBiswcntrl\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the
\fBiscntrl\fP function. It tests whether \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide character class "cntrl".
.PP
The wide character class "cntrl" is disjoint from the wide character class
"print" and therefore also disjoint from its subclasses "graph", "alpha",
"upper", "lower", "digit", "xdigit", "punct".
.PP
For an unsigned char \fIc\fP, \fIiscntrl(c)\fP implies \fIiswcntrl(btowc(c))\fP,
but not vice versa.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBiswcntrl\fP function returns non-zero if \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide character class "cntrl". Otherwise it returns zero.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR iscntrl "(3), " iswctype (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBiswcntrl\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
