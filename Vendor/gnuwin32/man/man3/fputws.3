.TH FPUTWS 3  "July 25, 1999" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
fputws \- write a wide character string to a FILE stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "int fputws (const wchar_t* " ws ", FILE* " stream );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBfputws\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the \fBfputs\fP
function. It writes the wide character string starting at \fIws\fP, up to but
not including the terminating L'\\0' character, to \fIstream\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBfputws\fP function returns a nonnegative integer if the operation was
successful, or -1 to indicate an error.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR fputwc (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBfputws\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
.PP
In the absence of additional information passed to the fopen call, it is
reasonable to expect that \fBfputws\fP will actually write the multibyte
string corresponding to the wide character string \fIws\fP.
