.TH ISWGRAPH 3  "July 25, 1999" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
iswgraph \- test for graphic wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "int iswgraph (wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBiswgraph\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the
\fBisgraph\fP function. It tests whether \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide character class "graph".
.PP
The wide character class "graph" is a subclass of the wide character class
"print".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide character class "print", the wide character class
"graph" is disjoint from the wide character class "cntrl".
.PP
The wide character class "graph" is disjoint from the wide character class
"space" and therefore also disjoint from its subclass "blank".
.\" Note: UNIX98 (susv2/xbd/locale.html) says that "graph" and "space" may
.\" have characters in common, except U+0020. But ISO C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999
.\" section 7.25.2.1.10) says that "space" and "graph" are disjoint.
.PP
The wide character class "graph" contains all the wide characters from the
wide character class "print" except the space character. It therefore contains
the wide character classes "alnum" and "punct".
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBiswgraph\fP function returns non-zero if \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide character class "graph". Otherwise it returns zero.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR isgraph "(3), " iswctype (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBiswgraph\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
