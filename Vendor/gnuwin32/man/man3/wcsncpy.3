.SH NAME
wcsncpy \- copy a fixed-size string of wide characters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "wchar_t* wcsncpy (wchar_t* " dest ", const wchar_t* " src ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBwcsncpy\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the \fBstrncpy\fP
function. It copies at most \fIn\fP wide characters from the wide-character
string pointed to by \fIsrc\fP, including the terminating L'\\0' character,
to the array pointed to by \fIdest\fP. Exactly \fIn\fP wide characters are
written at \fIdest\fP. If the length \fIwcslen(src)\fP is smaller than \fIn\fP,
the remaining wide characters in the array pointed to by \fIdest\fP are filled
with L'\\0' characters. If the length \fIwcslen(src)\fP is greater or equal
to \fIn\fP, the string pointed to by \fIdest\fP will not be L'\\0' terminated.
.PP
The strings may not overlap.
.PP
The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least \fIn\fP wide
characters at \fIdest\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fBwcsncpy\fP returns \fIdest\fP.
