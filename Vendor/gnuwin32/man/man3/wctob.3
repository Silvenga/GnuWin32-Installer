.SH NAME
wctob \- try to represent a wide character as a single byte
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "int wctob (wint_t " c );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBwctob\fP function tests whether the multi-byte representation of the
wide character \fIc\fP, starting in the initial state, consists of a single
byte. If so, it is returned as an unsigned char.
.PP
Never use this function. It cannot help you in writing internationalized
programs. Internationalized programs must never distinguish single-byte and
multi-byte characters.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBwctob\fP function returns the single-byte representation of \fIc\fP,
if it exists, of EOF otherwise.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR wctomb (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBwctob\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
.PP
This function should never be used. Internationalized programs must never
distinguish single-byte and multi-byte characters. Use the function
\fBwctomb\fP instead.
