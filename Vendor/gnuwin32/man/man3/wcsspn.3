.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBwcsspn\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the \fBstrspn\fP
function. It determines the length of the longest initial segment of \fIwcs\fP
which consists entirely of wide-characters listed in \fIaccept\fP. In other
words, it searches for the first occurrence in the wide-character string
\fIwcs\fP of a wide-character not contained in the wide-character string
\fIaccept\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBwcsspn\fP function returns the number of wide characters in the longest
initial segment of \fIwcs\fP which consists entirely of wide-characters listed
in \fIaccept\fP. In other words, it returns the position of the first
occurrence in the wide-character string \fIwcs\fP of a wide-character not
contained in the wide-character string \fIaccept\fP, or \fIwcslen(wcs)\fP
if there is none.
