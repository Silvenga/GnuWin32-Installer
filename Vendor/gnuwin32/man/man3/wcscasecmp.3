.SH NAME
wcscasecmp \- compare two wide-character strings, ignoring case
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "int wcscasecmp (const wchar_t* " s1 ", const wchar_t* " s2 );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBwcscasecmp\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the
\fBstrcasecmp\fP function. It compares the wide-character string pointed to
by \fIs1\fP and the wide-character string pointed to by \fIs2\fP, ignoring
case differences (\fBtowupper\fP, \fBtowlower\fP).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBwcscasecmp\fP function returns zero if the wide-character strings at
\fIs1\fP and \fIs2\fP are equal except for case distinctions. It returns a
positive integer if \fIs1\fP is greater than \fIs2\fP, ignoring case. It
returns a negative integer if \fIs1\fP is smaller than \fIs2\fP, ignoring case.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This function is a GNU extension.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR strcasecmp "(3), " wcscmp (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBwcscasecmp\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
