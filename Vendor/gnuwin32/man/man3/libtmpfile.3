.TH "Netpbm subroutine library: pm_tmpfile() function" 3 "22 July 2004" "netpbm documentation"
 
.SH NAME
pm_tmpfile() - tempfile creation routine using TMPFILE
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
#include <netpbm/pm.h>

FILE *
pm_tmpfile(void);
.fi

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
This simple example creates a temporary file, writes "hello world"
to it, then reads back and prints those contents.

.nf
#include <netpbm/pm.h>

FILE * myfile;

myfile = pm_tmpfile();

fprintf(myfile, "hello world\n");

fseek(myfile, 0, SEEK_SET);

fread(buffer, sizeof(buffer), 1, myfile);

fprintf(STDOUT, "temp file contains '%s'\n", buffer);

fclose(myfile);

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This library function is part of
.BR Netpbm (1).
.PP
\fBpm_tmpfile()\fP creates and opens an unnamed temporary file.
It is basically the same thing as the standard C library
\fBtmpfile()\fP function, except that it uses the \fBTMPFILE\fP
environment variable to decide where to create the temporary file.
If \fBTMPFILE\fP is not set or is set to something unusable (e.g.
too long), \fBpm_tmpfile()\fP falls back to the value of the
standard C library symbol \fBP_tmpdir\fP, just like \fBtmpfile()\fP.
.PP
Unlike \fBtmpfile()\fP, \fBpm_tmpfile()\fP never returns NULL.
If it fails, it issues a message to Standard Error and aborts the
program, like most libnetpbm routines do.

.SH HISTORY
\fBpm_tmpfile()\fP was introduced in Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004).
