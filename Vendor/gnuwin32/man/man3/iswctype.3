.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

.SH DESCRIPTION
If \fIwc\fP is a wide character having the character property designated by
\fIdesc\fP (or in other words: belongs to the character class designated by
\fIdesc\fP), the \fBiswctype\fP function returns non-zero. Otherwise it
returns zero. If \fIwc\fP is WEOF, zero is returned.
.PP
\fIdesc\fP must be a character property descriptor returned by the \fBwctype\fP
function.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBiswctype\fP function returns non-zero if the \fIwc\fP has the designated
property. Otherwise it returns 0.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
