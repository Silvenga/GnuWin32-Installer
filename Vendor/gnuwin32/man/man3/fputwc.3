.TH FPUTWC 3  "July 25, 1999" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
fputwc \- write a wide character to a FILE stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "wint_t fputwc (wchar_t " wc ", FILE* " stream );
.BI "wint_t putwc (wchar_t " wc ", FILE* " stream );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBfputwc\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the \fBfputc\fP
function. It writes the wide character \fIwc\fP to \fIstream\fP. If
\fIferror(stream)\fP becomes true, it returns WEOF. If a wide character
conversion error occurs, it sets \fBerrno\fP to \fBEILSEQ\fP and returns WEOF.
Otherwise it returns \fIwc\fP.
.PP
The \fBputwc\fP function or macro performs identically to \fBfputwc\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBfputwc\fP function returns \fIwc\fP if no error occurred, or WEOF to
indicate an error.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR fgetwc "(3), " fputws (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBfputwc\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
.PP
In the absence of additional information passed to the fopen call, it is
reasonable to expect that \fBfputwc\fP will actually write the multibyte
sequence corresponding to the wide character \fIwc\fP.
