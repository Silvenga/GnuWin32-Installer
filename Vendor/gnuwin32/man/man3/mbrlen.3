.TH MBRLEN 3  "May 12, 2000" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
mbrlen \- determine number of bytes in next multibyte character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "size_t mbrlen (const char* " s ", size_t " n ", mbstate_t* " ps );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The main case for this function is when \fIs\fP is not NULL. In this case,
the \fBmbrlen\fP function inspects at most \fIn\fP bytes of the multibyte
string starting at \fIs\fP and extracts the next complete multibyte character.
It updates the shift state \fI*ps\fP. If the multibyte character is not the
null wide character, it returns the number of bytes that were consumed from
\fIs\fP. If the multibyte character is the null wide character, it resets the
shift state \fI*ps\fP to the initial state and returns 0.
.PP
If the \fIn\fP bytes starting at \fIs\fP do not contain a complete multibyte
character, \fBmbrlen\fP keeps track of the partial multibyte character by
updating \fI*ps\fP and returns \fI(size_t)(-2)\fP. This can happen even if
\fIn\fP >= \fIMB_CUR_MAX\fP, if the multibyte string contains redundant shift
sequences.
.PP
If the multibyte string starting at \fIs\fP contains an invalid multibyte
sequence before the next complete character, \fBmbrlen\fP returns
\fI(size_t)(-1)\fP and sets \fBerrno\fP to \fBEILSEQ\fP. In this case,
the effects on \fI*ps\fP are undefined.
.PP
A second case is when \fIs\fP is NULL. In this case, \fIn\fP is ignored. If
\fI*ps\fP contains no partially accumulated multibyte character, the
\fBmbrlen\fP function puts \fI*ps\fP in the initial state and returns 0;
otherwise it returns \fI(size_t)(-1)\fP and sets \fBerrno\fP to \fBEILSEQ\fP.
.PP
In both of the above cases, if \fIps\fP is a NULL pointer, a static anonymous
state only known to the mbrlen function is used instead.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBmbrlen\fP function returns the number of bytes parsed from the multibyte
sequence starting at \fIs\fP, if a non-null wide character was recognized.
It returns 0, if a null wide character was recognized. It returns (size_t)(-1)
and sets \fBerrno\fP to \fBEILSEQ\fP, if an invalid multibyte sequence was
encountered. It returns (size_t)(-2) if it couldn't parse a complete multibyte
character, meaning that the remaining bytes should be fed to \fBmbrlen\fP in
a new call.

.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBmbrlen\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
