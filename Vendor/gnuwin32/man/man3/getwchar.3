.TH GETWCHAR 3  "July 25, 1999" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
getwchar \- read a wide character from standard input
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "wint_t getwchar (void);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgetwchar\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the
\fBgetchar\fP function. It reads a wide character from \fBstdin\fP and returns
it. If the end of stream is reached, or if \fIferror(stdin)\fP becomes
true, it returns WEOF. If a wide character conversion error occurs, it sets
\fBerrno\fP to \fBEILSEQ\fP and returns WEOF.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBgetwchar\fP function returns the next wide-character from standard input,
or WEOF.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR fgetwc (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBgetwchar\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
.PP
It is reasonable to expect that \fBgetwchar\fP will actually read a multibyte
sequence from standard input and then convert it to a wide character.
