.SH NAME
wcsncasecmp \- compare two fixed-size wide-character strings, ignoring case
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "int wcsncasecmp (const wchar_t* " s1 ", const wchar_t* " s2 ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBwcsncasecmp\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the
\fBstrncasecmp\fP function. It compares the wide-character string pointed to
by \fIs1\fP and the wide-character string pointed to by \fIs2\fP, but at most
\fIn\fP wide characters from each string, ignoring case differences
(\fBtowupper\fP, \fBtowlower\fP).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBwcsncasecmp\fP function returns zero if the wide-character strings at
\fIs1\fP and \fIs2\fP, truncated to at most length \fIn\fP, are equal except
for case distinctions. It returns a positive integer if truncated \fIs1\fP is
greater than truncated \fIs2\fP, ignoring case. It returns a negative integer
if truncated \fIs1\fP is smaller than truncated \fIs2\fP, ignoring case.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This function is a GNU extension.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR strncasecmp "(3), " wcsncmp (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBwcsncasecmp\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
