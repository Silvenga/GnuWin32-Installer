.SH NAME
fgetwc \- read a wide character from a FILE stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "wint_t fgetwc (FILE* " stream ");
.BI "wint_t getwc (FILE* " stream ");
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBfgetwc\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the \fBfgetc\fP
function. It reads a wide character from \fIstream\fP and returns it. If
the end of stream is reached, or if \fIferror(stream)\fP becomes true,
it returns WEOF. If a wide character conversion error occurs, it sets
\fBerrno\fP to \fBEILSEQ\fP and returns WEOF.
.PP
The \fBgetwc\fP function or macro performs identically to \fBfgetwc\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBfgetwc\fP function returns the next wide-character from the stream, or
WEOF.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR fputwc "(3), " fgetws "(3), " ungetwc (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBfgetwc\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
.PP
In the absence of additional information passed to the fopen call, it is
reasonable to expect that \fBfgetwc\fP will actually read a multibyte sequence
from the stream and then convert it to a wide character.
