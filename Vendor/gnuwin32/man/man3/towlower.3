.TH TOWLOWER 3  "July 25, 1999" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
towlower \- convert a wide character to lowercase
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "wint_t towlower (wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBtowlower\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the
\fBtolower\fP function. If \fIwc\fP is a wide character, it is converted to
lowercase. Characters which do not have case are returned unchanged.
If \fIwc\fP is WEOF, WEOF is returned.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBtowlower\fP function returns the lowercase equivalent of \fIwc\fP,
or WEOF if \fIwc\fP is WEOF.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR towupper "(3), " towctrans "(3), " iswlower (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBtowlower\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
.PP
This function is not very appropriate for dealing with Unicode characters,
because Unicode knows about three cases: upper, lower and title case.
