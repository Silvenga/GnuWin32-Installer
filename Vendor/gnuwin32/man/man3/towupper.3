.TH TOWUPPER 3  "July 25, 1999" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
towupper \- convert a wide character to uppercase
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "wint_t towupper (wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBtowupper\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the
\fBtoupper\fP function. If \fIwc\fP is a wide character, it is converted to
uppercase. Characters which do not have case are returned unchanged.
If \fIwc\fP is WEOF, WEOF is returned.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBtowupper\fP function returns the uppercase equivalent of \fIwc\fP,
or WEOF if \fIwc\fP is WEOF.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR towlower "(3), " towctrans "(3), " iswupper (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBtowupper\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
.PP
This function is not very appropriate for dealing with Unicode characters,
because Unicode knows about three cases: upper, lower and title case.
