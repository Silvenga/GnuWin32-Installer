sqrt(P)                                                 sqrt(P)





NAME
       sqrt, sqrtf, sqrtl - square root function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double sqrt(double x);
       float sqrtf(float x);
       long double sqrtl(long double x);


DESCRIPTION
       The  functionality  described  on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard.  Any  conflict  between
       the  requirements  described here and the ISO C standard
       is unintentional.  This volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions  shall compute the square root of their
       argument x,

       An application wishing to  check  for  error  situations
       should   set   errno   to   zero   and  call  feclearex-
       cept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.   On
       return,  if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID
       | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW  |  FE_UNDERFLOW)  is  non-
       zero, an error has occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return
       the square root of x.

       For finite values of x < -0, a domain error shall occur,
       and   either  a  NaN (if supported), or   an implementa-
       tion-defined value shall be returned.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is +-0 or +Inf, x shall be returned.

       If x is -Inf, a domain error shall occur, and  either  a
       NaN  (if  supported), or an implementation-defined value
       shall be returned.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Domain Error
              The finite value of x is < -0,    or x is -Inf.

       If   the   integer   expression   (math_errhandling    &
       MATH_ERRNO)  is  non-zero,  then  errno  shall be set to
       [EDOM]. If the integer  expression  (math_errhandling  &
       MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is non-zero, then the invalid floating-
       point exception shall be raised.

EXAMPLES
   Taking the Square Root of 9.0
              #include <math.h>
              ...
              double x = 9.0;
              double result;
              ...
              result = sqrt(x);


APPLICATION USAGE
       On   error,   the   expressions   (math_errhandling    &
       MATH_ERRNO)  and (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are
       independent of each other, but at least one of them must
       be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
