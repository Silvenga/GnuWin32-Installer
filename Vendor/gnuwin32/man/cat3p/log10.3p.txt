log10(P)                                               log10(P)





NAME
       log10, log10f, log10l - base 10 logarithm function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double log10(double x);
       float log10f(float x);
       long double log10l(long double x);


DESCRIPTION
       The  functionality  described  on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard.  Any  conflict  between
       the  requirements  described here and the ISO C standard
       is unintentional.  This volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions  shall compute the base 10 logarithm of
       their argument x, log_10(x).

       An application wishing to  check  for  error  situations
       should   set   errno   to   zero   and  call  feclearex-
       cept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.   On
       return,  if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID
       | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW  |  FE_UNDERFLOW)  is  non-
       zero, an error has occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return
       the base 10 logarithm of x.

       If x is +-0, a  pole  error  shall  occur  and  log10(),
       log10f(),   and   log10l()   shall   return   -HUGE_VAL,
       -HUGE_VALF, and -HUGE_VALL, respectively.

       For finite values of x that are less than 0,    or if  x
       is  -Inf,   a  domain error shall occur, and    either a
       NaN (if supported), or   an implementation-defined value
       shall be returned.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is 1, +0 shall be returned.

       If x is +Inf, +Inf shall be returned.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Domain Error
              The  finite  value  of  x is negative,    or x is
              -Inf.

       If   the   integer   expression   (math_errhandling    &
       MATH_ERRNO)  is  non-zero,  then  errno  shall be set to
       [EDOM]. If the integer  expression  (math_errhandling  &
       MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is non-zero, then the invalid floating-
       point exception shall be raised.

       Pole Error
              The value of x is zero.

       If   the   integer   expression   (math_errhandling    &
       MATH_ERRNO)  is  non-zero,  then  errno  shall be set to
       [ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &
       MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is  non-zero,  then  the divide-by-zero
       floating-point exception shall be raised.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       On   error,   the   expressions   (math_errhandling    &
       MATH_ERRNO)  and (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are
       independent of each other, but at least one of them must
       be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
