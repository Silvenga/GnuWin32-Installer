erf(P)                                                   erf(P)





NAME
       erf, erff, erfl - error functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double erf(double x);
       float erff(float x);
       long double erfl(long double x);


DESCRIPTION
       The  functionality  described  on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard.  Any  conflict  between
       the  requirements  described here and the ISO C standard
       is unintentional.  This volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions  shall  compute  the  error function of
       their argument x, defined as:

       An application wishing to  check  for  error  situations
       should   set   errno   to   zero   and  call  feclearex-
       cept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.   On
       return,  if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID
       | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW  |  FE_UNDERFLOW)  is  non-
       zero, an error has occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return
       the value of the error function.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is +-0, +-0 shall be returned.

       If x is +-Inf, +-1 shall be returned.

       If x is subnormal, a range error may occur, and 2  *  x/
       sqrt() should be returned.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       Range Error
              The result underflows.

       If    the   integer   expression   (math_errhandling   &
       MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then  errno  shall  be  set  to
       [ERANGE].  If the integer expression (math_errhandling &
       MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the  underflow  float-
       ing-point exception shall be raised.


       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Underflow occurs when |x| < DBL_MIN * ( sqrt()/2).

       On    error,   the   expressions   (math_errhandling   &
       MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT)  are
       independent of each other, but at least one of them must
       be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
