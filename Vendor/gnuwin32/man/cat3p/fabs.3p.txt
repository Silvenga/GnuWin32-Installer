NAME
       fabs, fabsf, fabsl - absolute value function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double fabs(double x);
       float fabsf(float x);
       long double fabsl(long double x);


DESCRIPTION
       The  functionality  described  on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard.  Any  conflict  between
       the  requirements  described here and the ISO C standard
       is unintentional.  This volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions  shall  compute  the  absolute value of
       their argument x,| x|.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return
       the absolute value of x.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is +-0, +0 shall be returned.

       If x is +-Inf, +Inf shall be returned.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
