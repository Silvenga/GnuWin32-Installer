NAME
       sinh, sinhf, sinhl - hyperbolic sine functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double sinh(double x);
       float sinhf(float x);
       long double sinhl(long double x);


DESCRIPTION
       The  functionality  described  on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard.  Any  conflict  between
       the  requirements  described here and the ISO C standard
       is unintentional.  This volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions  shall  compute  the hyperbolic sine of
       their argument x.

       An application wishing to  check  for  error  situations
       should   set   errno   to   zero   and  call  feclearex-
       cept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.   On
       return,  if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID
       | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW  |  FE_UNDERFLOW)  is  non-
       zero, an error has occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return
       the hyperbolic sine of x.

       If the result would cause an  overflow,  a  range  error
       shall occur and +-HUGE_VAL, +-HUGE_VALF, and +-HUGE_VALL
       (with the same sign as x) shall be returned as appropri-
       ate for the type of the function.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is +-0 or +-Inf, x shall be returned.

       If  x is subnormal, a range error may occur and x should
       be returned.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Range Error
              The result would cause an overflow.

       If   the   integer   expression   (math_errhandling    &
       MATH_ERRNO)  is  non-zero,  then  errno  shall be set to
       [ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &
       MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the overflow floating-
       point exception shall be raised.


       These functions may fail if:

       Range Error
              The value x is subnormal.

       If   the   integer   expression   (math_errhandling    &
       MATH_ERRNO)  is  non-zero,  then  errno  shall be set to
       [ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &
       MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is  non-zero, then the underflow float-
       ing-point exception shall be raised.


       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       On   error,   the   expressions   (math_errhandling    &
       MATH_ERRNO)  and (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are
       independent of each other, but at least one of them must
       be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
