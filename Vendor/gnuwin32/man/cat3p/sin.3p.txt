sin(P)                                                   sin(P)





NAME
       sin, sinf, sinl - sine function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double sin(double x);
       float sinf(float x);
       long double sinl(long double x);


DESCRIPTION
       The  functionality  described  on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard.  Any  conflict  between
       the  requirements  described here and the ISO C standard
       is unintentional.  This volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall compute the sine of their argument
       x, measured in radians.

       An application wishing to  check  for  error  situations
       should   set   errno   to   zero   and  call  feclearex-
       cept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.   On
       return,  if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID
       | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW  |  FE_UNDERFLOW)  is  non-
       zero, an error has occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return
       the sine of x.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is +-0, x shall be returned.

       If x is subnormal, a range error may occur and x  should
       be returned.

       If  x is +-Inf, a domain error shall occur, and either a
       NaN (if supported), or an  implementation-defined  value
       shall be returned.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Domain Error
              The x argument is +-Inf.

       If    the   integer   expression   (math_errhandling   &
       MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then  errno  shall  be  set  to
       [EDOM].  If  the  integer expression (math_errhandling &
       MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the invalid  floating-
       point exception shall be raised.


       These functions may fail if:

       Range Error
              The value of x is subnormal

       If    the   integer   expression   (math_errhandling   &
       MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then  errno  shall  be  set  to
       [ERANGE].  If the integer expression (math_errhandling &
       MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the  underflow  float-
       ing-point exception shall be raised.


       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Taking the Sine of a 45-Degree Angle
              #include <math.h>
              ...
              double radians = 45.0 * M_PI / 180;
              double result;
              ...
              result = sin(radians);


APPLICATION USAGE
       These functions may lose accuracy when their argument is
       near a multiple of  or is far from 0.0.

       On   error,   the   expressions   (math_errhandling    &
       MATH_ERRNO)  and (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are
       independent of each other, but at least one of them must
       be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
