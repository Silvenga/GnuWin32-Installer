cbrt(P)                                                 cbrt(P)





NAME
       cbrt, cbrtf, cbrtl - cube root functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double cbrt(double x);
       float cbrtf(float x);
       long double cbrtl(long double x);


DESCRIPTION
       The  functionality  described  on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard.  Any  conflict  between
       the  requirements  described here and the ISO C standard
       is unintentional.  This volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions  shall  compute  the  real cube root of
       their argument x.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return
       the cube root of x.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is +-0 or +-Inf, x shall be returned.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       For  some applications, a true cube root function, which
       returns negative results for negative arguments, is more
       appropriate  than  pow( x, 1.0/3.0), which returns a NaN
       for x less than 0.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
