copysign(P)                                         copysign(P)





NAME
       copysign,  copysignf,  copysignl  -  number manipulation
       function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double copysign(double x, double y);
       float copysignf(float x, float y);
       long double copysignl(long double x, long double y);


DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this  reference  page  is
       aligned  with  the  ISO C standard. Any conflict between
       the requirements described here and the  ISO C  standard
       is  unintentional.   This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall produce a value with the magnitude
       of  x  and the sign of y. On implementations that repre-
       sent a signed zero but do not treat negative  zero  con-
       sistently  in  arithmetic  operations,  these  functions
       regard the sign of zero as positive.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return
       a value with the magnitude of x and the sign of y.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
