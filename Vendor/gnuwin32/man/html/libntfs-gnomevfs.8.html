<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
libntfs-gnomevfs - Module for GNOME VFS that allows access to NTFS
filesystems. 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Overview</a></h2>
The GNOME virtual filesystem (VFS) provides universal
access to different filesystems. The <b>libntfs-gnomevfs</b> module enables GNOME
VFS aware clients to seamlessly utilize the NTFS library <b>libntfs</b>. 
<p> So you
can access an NTFS filesystem without needing to use the NTFS utilities
themselves (at least in theory anyway).  In practice this is probably more
useful for programs and programmers to make using <b>libntfs</b> easier, more
generic, and to allow easier debugging of <b>libntfs</b>. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Examples</a></h2>

<h3><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Prerequisites</a></h3>
<p>
To
be able to follow these examples you will need to have installed the test
utilities from the gnome-vfs-2.4.x package.  The easiest way to do this is to
download and compile the gnome-vfs-2 package, e.g. download from: 
<p> <a href='http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/desktop/2.4/2.4.0/sources/gnome-vfs-2.4.0.tar.gz'>http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/desktop/2.4/2.4.0/sources/gnome-vfs-2.4.0.tar.gz</a>


<p> Then run ./configure followed by make and make install (as root).  This
will install it into /usr/local so it should not conflict with your existing
installation from  rpm or deb packages which will be in /usr. 
<p> Note you
may also need to add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf and then run ldconfig
(as root) to let your system see the installed gnome-vfs-2.4.x libraries. 
<p> Then
run ./configure followed by make and make install (as root) in the main
<b>ntfsprogs</b> directory to build and install the <b>libntfs-gnomevfs</b> module and
<b>libntfs</b> library which is used by the module. 
<p> 
<h3><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Copying a file from an NTFS
partition</a></h3>
<p>
To copy the file autoexec.bat from the main directory of an NTFS
partition (/dev/hda1) to the /tmp directory on your system you could run:

<p> /path/to/gnome-vfs-2.4.x/test/test-xfer file:///dev/hda1#libntfs:/autoexec.bat

<p>/tmp/autoexec.bat 
<p> To copy a file from a directory inside the NTFS partition
you would just specify the full path. So for example to copy the file win.ini
from the Windows directory you would run: 
<p> /path/to/gnome-vfs-2.4.x/test/test-xfer

<p>file:///dev/hda1#libntfs:/Windows/win.ini /tmp/win.ini 
<p> 
<h3><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Shell access to an
NTFS partition</a></h3>
<p>
For debugging it is most useful to be able to do various
things to the NTFS partition while it is being operated upon by <b>libntfs</b>.
This is achieved using the test-shell utility (from the gnome-vfs-2.4.x package)
by running: /path/to/gnome-vfs-2.4.x/test/test-shell 
<p> This drops you into the
GNOME VFS shell from where you can now cd into the NTFS partition (/dev/hda1)
by typing: cd file:///dev/hda1#libntfs:/ 
<p> You are now in the root directory
of the NTFS partition.  The first thing you will probably want to do is
to type "ls" to display the directory contents. 
<p> You could then change directories
using the "cd" command, e.g. to enter the Windows directory you would type:

<p>cd Windows 
<p> You can then open files, seek inside files, read from files
(write is not enabled at present), etc thus exercising large portions of
the NTFS library. 
<p> Use the "help" command while in the shell to see the
available commands. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Bugs</a></h2>
<p>
No bugs are known but there are several limitations
at the moment: 
<p> You cannot get information about files other than what
the "ls" command  in the test-shell can give you, i.e. the "info" command
in the test-shell does not work. 
<p> Further access to the partition is read-only
and hence you cannot write to files.  This will be changed in the future
once the module has had more wide testing. 
<p> There may be other limitations
and possibly bugs.  Please report any problems to the NTFS mailing list:
