 <br>
CALC OPTIONS <p>

<p> 
<dl>

<dt><b>-c</b> </dt>
<dd>Continue reading command lines even after an execution
error has caused the abandonment of a line. <p>
For example: <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc read many_errors.cal
</pre> <p>
will cause <b>calc</b> to abort on the first error, whereas: <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc -c read many_errors.cal
</pre> <p>
will cause <b>calc</b> to try to process each line being read despite the errors
that it encounters. <p>
By default, calc startup resource files are silently
ignored if not found. This flag will report missing startup resource files
unless <b>-d</b> is also given. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-C</b> </dt>
<dd>Permit the execution of custom builtin functions.
Without this flag, calling the custom() builtin function will simply generate
an error. <p>
Use of this flag may cause <b>calc</b> to execute functions that are
non-standard and that are not portable.  Custom builtin functions are disabled
by default for this reason. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-d</b> </dt>
<dd>Disable the printing of the opening title.
 The printing of resource file debug and informational messages is also
disabled as if <b>config("resource_debug", 0)</b> had been executed. <p>
For example:
<p>
 calc "read qtime; <a href='qtime.2.html'>qtime(2)</a>
"  <p>
will output something like: <p>
 <br>
<pre>qtime(utc_hr_offset) defined
It&rsquo;s nearly ten past six.
</pre> <p>
whereas: <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc -d "read qtime; qtime(2)"
</pre> <p>
will just say: <p>
 <br>
<pre>It&rsquo;s nearly ten past six.
</pre> <p>
This flag disables the reporting of missing calc startup resource files.

<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-D</b> calc_debug[:resource_debug[:user_debug]] </dt>
<dd>Force the initial value of
config("calc_debug"), config("resource_debug") and config("user_debug").
<p>
The : separated strings are interpreted as signed 32 bit integers. After
an optional leading sign a leading zero indicates octal conversion, and
a leading &lsquo;&lsquo;0x&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;0X&rsquo;&rsquo; hexadecimal conversion.  Otherwise, decimal conversion
is assumed. <p>
By default, <i>calc_debug</i> is 0, <i>resource_debug</i> is 3 and <i>user_debug</i>
is 0. <p>
For more information use the following <b>calc</b> command: <p>
 <br>
<pre>help config
</pre> 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-e</b> </dt>
<dd>Ignore any environment variables on startup. The getenv() builtin will
still return values, however. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-f</b> </dt>
<dd>This flag is required when using calc in
<b>shell script mode</b>. It must be at the end of the initial <b>#!</b> line of the script.
<p>
This flag is normally only at the end of a calc shell script. If the first
line of an executable file begins <b>#!</b> followed by the absolute pathname
of the <b>calc</b> program and the flag <b>-f</b> as in: <p>
 <br>
<pre>#!c:/progra~1/Calc/bin/calc&nbsp;[other_flags&nbsp;...] -f
</pre> <p>
the rest of the file will be processed in <b>shell script mode</b>. See <b>SHELL
SCRIPT MODE</b> section of this man page below for details. <p>
The actual form
of this flag is: <p>
 <b>-f</b> filename  <p>
On systems that treat an executable that
begins with <b>#!</b> as a script, the path of the execurable is appended by the
kernel as the final argument to the exec() system call. This is why the
<b>-f</b> flag at the very end of the <b>#!</b> line. <p>
It is possible use <b>-f&nbsp;filename</b> on the
command line: <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc&nbsp;[other_flags&nbsp;...] -f filename
</pre> <p>
This will cause calc to process lines in <b>filename</b> in <b>shell script mode</b>.
<p>
Use of <b>-f</b> implies <b>-s</b>. In addition, <b>-d</b> and <b>-p</b> are implied if <b>-i</b> is not given. 
<p>
</dd>

<dt><b>-h</b> </dt>
<dd>Print a help message.  This option implies <b>-q</b>. This is equivalent to the
<b>calc</b> command help help. The help facility is disabled unless the mode is
5 or 7. See <b>-m</b>. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-i</b> </dt>
<dd>Become interactive if possible. If <i>calc_cmd</i> args are given,
<b>calc</b> by default, calc will execute them and exit. This flag causes <b>calc</b>
to drop into interactive mode after the commands are executed. This flag
will cause <b>calc</b> to drop into interactive mode after the commands are executed.
<p>
For example: <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc 2+5
</pre> <p>
will print the value 7 and exit whereas: <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc -i 2+5
</pre> <p>
will print the value 7 and prompt the user for more <b>calc</b> commands. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-m</b> mode
</dt>
<dd>This flag sets the permission mode of <b>calc</b>. It controls the ability for
<b>calc</b> to open files and execute programs. <i>Mode</i> may be a number from 0 to
7. <p>
The mode value is interpreted in a way similar to that of the <a href='chmod.1.html'><b>chmod</b>(1)</a>

octal mode: <p>
 <br>
<pre>0  do not open any file, do not execute progs
1  do not open any file
2  do not open files for reading, do not execute progs
3  do not open files for reading
4  do not open files for writing, do not execute progs
5  do not open files for writing
6  do not execute any program
7  allow everything (default mode)
</pre> <p>
If one wished to run <b>calc</b> from a privileged user, one might want to use
<b>-m</b> 0 in an effort to make <b>calc</b> somewhat more secure. <p>
Mode bits for reading
and writing apply only on an open. Files already open are not effected. Thus
if one wanted to use the <b>-m</b> 0 in an effort to make <b>calc</b> somewhat more secure,
but still wanted to read and write a specific file, one might want to do
in <a href='sh.1.html'><b>sh</b>(1)</a>
, <a href='ksh.1.html'><b>ksh</b>(1)</a>
, <a href='bash.1.html'><b>bash</b>(1)</a>
-like shells: <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc -m 0 3&lt;a.file
</pre> <p>
Files presented to <b>calc</b> in this way are opened in an unknown mode. <b>Calc</b>
will attempt to read or write them if directed. <p>
If the mode disables opening
of files for reading, then the startup resource files are disabled as if
<b>-q</b> was given. The reading of key bindings is also disabled when the mode
disables opening of files for reading. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-O</b> </dt>
<dd>Use the old classic defaults instead
of the default configuration. This flag as the same effect as executing
<b>config("all", "oldcfg")</b> at startup time. <p>
NOTE: Older versions of calc used
<b>-n</b> to setup a modified form of the default calc configuration. The <b>-n</b> flag
currently does nothing. Use of the <b>-n</b> flag is now deprecated and may be used
for something else in the future. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-p</b> </dt>
<dd>Pipe processing is enabled by use of
<b>-p</b>. For example: <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc -p "2^21701-1" | fizzbin
</pre> <p>
In pipe mode, <b>calc</b> does not prompt, does not print leading tabs and does
not print the initial header. The <b>-p</b> flag overrides <b>-i</b>. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-q</b> </dt>
<dd>Disable the reading
of the startup scripts. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-s</b> </dt>
<dd>By default, all <i>calc_cmd</i> args are evaluated and
executed. This flag will disable their evaluation and instead make them
available as strings for the argv() builtin function. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-u</b> </dt>
<dd>Disable buffering
of stdin and stdout. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-v</b> </dt>
<dd>Print the <b>calc</b> version number and exit. </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<p>  <br>
CALC COMMAND LINE <p>
With no <i>calc_cmd</i> arguments, <b>calc</b> operates interactively.
If one or more arguments are given on the command line and <b>-s</b> is NOT given,
then <b>calc</b> will read and execute them and either attempt to go interactive
according as the <b>-i</b> flag was present or absent. <p>
If <b>-s</b> is given, <b>calc</b> will
not evaluate any <i>calc_cmd</i> arguments but instead make them available as
strings to the argv() builtin function. 
<p> Sufficiently simple commands with
no no characters like parentheses, brackets, semicolons, &rsquo;*&rsquo;, which have
special interpretations in UNIX shells may be entered, possibly with spaces,
until the terminating newline. For example: <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc 23 + 47
</pre> <p>
should respond with display of 70, but <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc 23 * 47
</pre> <p>
may fail. Such cases can usually be made to work as expected by enclosing
the command between single marks as in: <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc "23 * 47"
</pre> <p>
and <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc "print sqrt(2), exp(1)"
</pre> <p>
If &rsquo;!&rsquo; is to be used to indicate the factorial function, for shells like
<a href='csh.1.html'><b>csh</b><i>(1)</i></a>
 for which &rsquo;!&rsquo; followed by a non-space character is used for history
substitution, it may be necessary to include a space or use a backslash
to escape the special meaning of &rsquo;!&rsquo;. For example, the command: <p>
 <br>
<pre>print 27!^2
</pre> <p>
may have to be replaced by: <p>
 <br>
<pre>print 27! ^2<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;or<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;print 27!^2
</pre> 
<p>  <br>
CALC STARTUP FILES <p>
Normally on startup, if the environment variable <b>$CALCRC</b>
is undefined and <b>calc</b> is invoked without the <b>-q</b> flag, or if <b>$CALCRC</b> is defined
and calc is invoked with <b>-e</b>, <b>calc</b> looks for a file "startup" in the calc
resource directory <b>.calcrc</b> in the user&rsquo;s home directory, and <b>.calcinit in
the current directory.</b> If one or more of these are found, they are read
in succession as <b>calc</b> scripts and their commands executed. When defined,
<b>$CALCRC</b> is to contain a &rsquo;:&rsquo; separated list of names of files, and if calc
is then invoked without either the <b>-q</b> or <b>-e</b> flags, these files are read in
succession and their commands executed. No error condition is produced if
a listed file is not found. <p>
If the mode specified by <b>-m</b> disables opening
of files for reading, then the reading of startup files is also disabled
as if <b>-q</b> was given. 
<p>  <br>
CALC FILE SEARCH PATH <p>
If the environment variable <b>$CALCPATH</b> is undefined,
or if it is defined and <b>calc</b> is invoked with the <b>-e</b> flag, when a file name
not beginning with <b>/</b>, <b>~</b> or <b>./</b>, is specified as in: <p>
 <br>
<pre>calc read myfile
</pre> <p>
<b>calc</b> searches in succession: <p>
 <br>
<pre>c:/progra~1/Calc/lib/myfile
c:/progra~1/Calc/lib/myfile.cal
c:/progra~1/Calc/share/calc/calc/custom/myfile
c:/progra~1/Calc/share/calc/calc/custom/myfile.cal
</pre> <p>
If the file is found, the search stops and the commands in the file are
executed. It is an error if no readable file with the specified name is
found. An alternative search path can be specified by defining <b>$CALCPATH</b>
in the same way as PATH is defined, as a &rsquo;:&rsquo; separated list of directories,
and then invoking <b>calc</b> without the <b>-e</b> flag. <p>
<b>Calc</b> treats all open files, other
than stdin, stdout and stderr as files available for reading and writing.
One may present <b>calc</b> with an already open file using <a href='sh.1.html'><b>sh</b>(1)</a>
, <a href='ksh.1.html'><b>ksh</b>(1)</a>
, <a href='bash.1.html'><b>bash</b>(1)</a>
-like
shells is to: <p>
 calc 3&lt;open_file 4&lt;open_file2  <p>
For more information use the
following <b>calc</b> commands: <p>
 <br>
<pre>help help
help overview
help usage
help environment
help config
</pre> <p>
<p>

<p>  <br>
SHELL SCRIPT MODE <p>
If the first line of an executable file begins <b>#!</b> followed
by the absolute pathname of the <b>calc</b> program and the flag <b>-f</b> as in: <p>
 <br>
<pre>#!c:/progra~1/Calc/bin/calc&nbsp;[other_flags&nbsp;...] -f
</pre> <p>
the rest of the file will be processed in <b>shell script mode</b>. Note that
<b>-f</b> must at the end of the intiial &lsquo;&lsquo;#!&rsquo;&rsquo; line. Any other optional <b>other_flags</b>
must come before the <b>-f</b>. <p>
In <b>shell script mode</b> the contents of the file are
read and executed as if they were in a file being processed by a read command,
except that a "command" beginning with &rsquo;#&rsquo; followed by whitespace and ending
at the next newline is treated as a comment. Any optional <b>other_flags</b> will
be parsed first followed by the later lines within the script itself. <p>
In
<b>shell script mode</b>, <b>-s</b> is always assumed. In addition, <b>-d</b> and <b>-p</b> are automatically
set if <b>-i</b> is not given. <p>
For example, if the file <b>/tmp/mersenne</b>: <p>
 <br>
<pre>#!c:/progra~1/Calc/bin/calc&nbsp;-q -f
#
# mersenne - an example of a calc shell script file
/* parse args */
if (argv() != 1) {
    fprintf(files(2), "usage: %s exp\n", config("program"));
    abort "must give one exponent arg";
}
/* print the mersenne number */
print "2^": argv(0) : "-1 =", 2^eval(argv(0))-1;
</pre> <p>
is made an executable file by: <p>
 <br>
<pre>chmod +x /tmp/mersenne
</pre> <p>
then the command line: <p>
 <br>
<pre>/tmp/mersenne 127
</pre> <p>
will print: <p>
 <br>
<pre>2^127-1 = 170141183460469231731687303715884105727
</pre> <p>
Note that because <b>-s</b> is assumed in <b>shell script mode</b> and non-dashed args
are made available as strings via the <b>argv</b>() builtin function. Therefore:
<p>
 <br>
<pre>2^eval(argv(0))-1
</pre> <p>
will print the decimal value of 2^n-1 but <p>
 <br>
<pre>2^argv(0)-1
</pre> <p>
will not. <p>

<p>  <br>
DATA TYPES <p>
Fundamental builtin data types include integers, real numbers,
rational numbers, complex numbers and strings. <p>
By use of an object, one
may define an arbitrarily complex data types. One may define how such objects
behave a wide range of operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, negation, squaring, modulus, rounding, exponentiation, equality,
comparison, printing and so on. <p>
For more information use the following <b>calc</b>
commands: <p>
 help types <br>
help obj <br>
show objfuncs  <p>

<p>  <br>
VARIABLES <p>
Variables in <i>calc</i> are typeless. In other words, the fundamental
type of a variable is determined by its content. Before a variable is assigned
a value it has the value of zero. <p>
The scope of a variable may be global,
local to a file, or local to a procedure. Values may be grouped together
in a matrix, or into a a list that permits stack and queue style operations.
<p>
For more information use the following <b>calc</b> commands: <p>
 help variable <br>
help mat <br>
help list <br>
show globals  <p>

<p>  <br>
INPUT/OUTPUT <p>
A leading &lsquo;&lsquo;0x&rsquo;&rsquo; implies a hexadecimal value, a leading &lsquo;&lsquo;0b&rsquo;&rsquo; implies
a binary value, and a &lsquo;&lsquo;0&rsquo;&rsquo; followed by a digit implies an octal value. Complex
numbers are indicated by a trailing &lsquo;&lsquo;i&rsquo;&rsquo; such as in &lsquo;&lsquo;3+4i&rsquo;&rsquo;. Strings may be delimited
by either a pair of single or double quotes. By default, <i>calc</i> prints values
as if they were floating point numbers. One may change the default to print
values in a number of modes including fractions, integers and exponentials.
<p>
A number of stdio-like file I/O operations are provided. One may open, read,
write, seek and close files. Filenames are subject to &lsquo;&lsquo;~&rsquo;&rsquo; expansion to home
directories in a way similar to that of the Korn or C-Shell. <p>
For example:
<p>
 ~/.calcrc <br>
~chongo/lib/fft_multiply.cal  <p>
For more information use the following <b>calc</b>
command: <p>
 help file  <p>

<p>  <br>
CALC LANGUAGE <p>
The <i>calc</i> language is a C-like language. The language includes
commands such as variable declarations, expressions, tests, labels, loops,
file operations, function calls. These commands are very similar to their
counterparts in C. <p>
The language also include a number of commands particular
to <i>calc</i> itself. These include commands such as function definition, help,
reading in resource files, dump files to a file, error notification, configuration
control and status. <p>
For more information use the following <b>calc</b> command:
<p>
 help command <br>
help statement <br>
help expression <br>
help operator <br>
help config  <p>
