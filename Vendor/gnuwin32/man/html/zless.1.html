<i>Zless</i> is a filter which allows examination of compressed
or plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It
is the equivalent of setting the environment variable LESSOPEN to "|gzip
-cdfq -- %s", and then running <i>less</i>. However, enough people seem to think that
having the command <i>zless</i> available is important to be worth providing it.

<p> Note that zless does not work with files piped to it on stdin, it only
works with files specified as arguments.  If you really want to use less
in a pipe, then do the uncompress explicitly and pipe to less instead of
zless.

<i>Zless</i> does not work with compressed
data that is piped to it via standard input; it requires that input files
be specified as arguments.
