<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>SYNOPSIS</a></h2>
  
 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
 A complete reference for writing  manual pages with the  macro
package; a  and  formatting package for   Its predecessor, the  package,
addressed page layout leaving the manipulation of fonts and other typesetting
details to the individual author. In  page layout macros make up the  which
consists of macros for titles, section headers, displays and lists - essentially
items which affect the physical position of text on a formatted page. In
addition to the page structure domain, there are two more domains, the
 domain and the  text domain. The general text domain is defined as macros
which perform tasks such as quoting or emphasizing pieces of text. The manual
domain is defined as macros that are a subset of the day to day informal
language used to describe commands, routines and related  files. Macros
in the manual domain handle command names, command line arguments and options,
function names, function parameters, pathnames, variables, cross references
to other manual pages, and so on. These domain items have value for both
the author and the future user of the manual page. Hopefully, the consistency
gained across the manual set will provide easier translation to future
documentation tools.  Throughout the  manual pages, a manual entry is simply
referred to as a man page, regardless of actual length and without sexist
intention.   
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>GETTING STARTED</a></h2>
 The material presented in the remainder of
this document is outlined as follows:                                 
                                                                      
                     
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>TROFF IDIOSYNCRASIES</a></h2>
 The  package attempts to simplify
the process of writing a man page. Theoretically, one should not have to
learn the tricky details of   to use  however, there are a few limitations
which are unavoidable and best gotten out of the way. And, too, be forewarned,
this package is  fast.    As in   a macro is called by placing a  (dot character)
at the beginning of a line followed by the two-character (or three-character)
name for the macro. There can be space or tab characters between the dot
and the macro name. Arguments may follow the macro separated by spaces (but
 tabs). It is the dot character at the beginning of the line which causes
  to interpret the next two (or more) characters as a macro name. A single
starting dot followed by nothing is ignored. To place a  (dot character)
at the beginning of an input line in some context other than a macro invocation,
precede the  (dot) with the  escape sequence which translates literally
to a zero-width space, and is never displayed in the output.  In general,
  macros accept an unlimited number of arguments (contrary to other versions
of troff which can&rsquo;t handle more than nine arguments). In limited cases,
arguments may be continued or extended on the next line (See  below). Almost
all macros handle quoted arguments (see  below).  Most of the  general text
domain and manual domain macros are special in that their argument lists
are  for callable macro names. This means an argument on the argument list
which matches a general text or manual domain macro name (and which is
defined to be callable) will be executed or called when it is processed.
In this case the argument, although the name of a macro, is not preceded
by a  (dot). This makes it possible to nest macros; for example the option
macro,  may  the flag and argument macros,  and  to specify an optional
flag with an argument:    is produced by     To prevent a string from being
interpreted as a macro name, precede the string with the escape sequence
    is produced by     Here the strings  and  are not interpreted as macros.
Macros whose argument lists are parsed for callable arguments are referred
to as  and macros which may be called from an argument list are referred
to as  throughout this document. This is a technical  as almost all of the
macros in  are parsed, but as it was cumbersome to constantly refer to
macros as being callable and being able to call other macros, the term
parsed has been used.   In the following, we call an  macro which starts
a line (with a leading dot) a  if this distinction is necessary.    Sometimes
it is desirable to give as an argument a string containing one or more
blank space characters, say, to specify arguments to commands which expect
particular arrangement of items in the argument list. Additionally, it makes
 working faster. For example, the function command  expects the first argument
to be the name of a function and any remaining arguments to be function
parameters. As  stipulates the declaration of function parameters in the
parenthesized parameter list, each parameter is guaranteed to be at minimum
a two word string. For example,   There are two possible ways to pass an
argument which contains an embedded space. One way of passing a string containing
blank spaces is to use the hard or unpaddable space character  that is,
a blank space preceded by the escape character  This method may be used
with any macro but has the side effect of interfering with the adjustment
of text over the length of a line.  sees the hard space as if it were any
other printable character and cannot split the string into blank or newline
separated pieces as one would expect. This method is useful for strings
which are not expected to overlap a line boundary. An alternative is to
use  a paddable (i.e. stretchable), unbreakable space (this is a   extension).
The second method is to enclose the string with double quotes.  For example:
   is created by   can also be created by     If the  before the space
in the first example or double quotes in the second example were omitted,
 would see three arguments, and the result would be:            can be
confused by blank space characters at the end of a line. It is a wise preventive
measure to globally remove all blank spaces from  character sequences. Should
the need arise to use a blank character at the end of a line, it may be
forced with an unpaddable space and the  escape character. For example,
    Special characters like the newline character  are handled by replacing
the  with  (e.g.  to preserve the backslash.    A warning is emitted when
an empty input line is found outside of displays (see below). Use  instead.
(Well, it is even better to use  macros to avoid the usage of low-level
commands.)  Leading spaces will cause a break and are output directly. Avoid
this behaviour if possible. Similarly, do not use more than one space character
between words in an ordinary text line; contrary to other text formatters,
they are  replaced with a single space.  You can&rsquo;t pass  directly as an argument.
Use  (or  instead.  By default,  inserts two space characters after a punctuation
mark closing a sentence; characters like  or  are treated transparently,
not influencing the sentence-ending behaviour. To change this, insert  before
or after the dot:   The .Ql . character. .Pp The .Ql \&amp;. character. .Pp .No test .
test .Pp .No test. test    gives   The  character  The  character.   test 
 test    As can be seen in the first and third line,  handles punctuation
characters specially in macro arguments. This will be explained in section
 below. In the same way, you have to protect trailing full stops of abbreviations
with a trailing zero-width space:   A comment in the source file of a man
page can be either started with  on a single line,  after some input, or
 anywhere (the latter is a   extension); the rest of such a line is ignored.

<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>TITLE MACROS</a></h2>
 The
title macros are part of the page structure domain but are presented first
and separately for someone who wishes to start writing a man page yesterday.
Three header macros designate the document title or manual page title,
the operating system, and the date of authorship. These macros are called
once at the very beginning of the document and are used to construct headers
and footers only.        The document title is the subject of the man page
and must be in  due to troff limitations. If omitted,  is used. The section
number may be a number in the range  or   or  If it is specified, and no
volume name is given, a default volume name is used.   Under  the following
sections are defined:               A volume name may be arbitrary or one
of the following:                 For compatibility,  can be used for

If the third parameter is a keyword designating a computer architecture,
its value is prepended to the default volume name as specified by the second
parameter. By default, the following architecture keywords are defined:
 # we use &lsquo;No&rsquo; to avoid hyphenation            If the section number is neither
a numeric expression in the range 1 to~9 nor one of the above described
keywords, the third parameter is used verbatim as the volume name.  In the
following examples, the left (which is identical to the right) and the
middle part of the manual page header strings are shown. Note how  prevents
the digit~7 from being a valid numeric expression.

<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>INTRODUCTION OF MANUAL AND GENERAL TEXT DOMAINS</a></h2>

  The manual domain macro names are derived from the day to day informal
language used to describe commands, subroutines and related files. Slightly
different variations of this language are used to describe the three different
aspects of writing a man page. First, there is the description of  macro
command usage. Second is the description of a  command   macros, and third,
the description of a command to a user in the verbal sense; that is, discussion
of a command in the text of a man page.  In the first case,  macros are
themselves a type of command; the general syntax for a troff command is:
       is a macro command, and anything following it are arguments to be
processed. In the second case, the description of a  command using the content
macros is a bit more involved; a typical  command line might be displayed
as:         Here,  is the command name and the bracketed string  is a 
argument designated as optional by the option brackets. In  terms,  and
 are called  in this example, the user has to replace the meta expressions
given in angle brackets with real file names. Note that in this document
meta arguments are used to describe  commands; in most man pages, meta
variables are not specifically written with angle brackets. The macros which
formatted the above example:   .Nm filter .Op Fl flag .Ao Ar infile Ac Ao
Ar outfile Ac    In the third case, discussion of commands and command
syntax includes both examples above, but may add more detail. The arguments
 and  from the example above might be referred to as  or  Some command
line argument lists are quite long:                   Here one might talk
about the command  and qualify the argument,  as an argument to the flag,
 or discuss the optional file operand  In the verbal context, such detail
can prevent confusion, however the  package does not have a macro for an
argument  a flag. Instead the  argument macro is used for an operand or
file argument like  as well as an argument to a flag like  The make command

are explained in     The manual domain and general text domain macros share
a similar syntax with a few minor deviations; most notably,    and  differ
only when called without arguments; and  and  impose an order on their
argument lists. All content macros are capable of recognizing and properly
handling punctuation, provided each punctuation character is separated
by a leading space. If a command is given:    The result is:    The punctuation
is not recognized and all is output in the font used by  If the punctuation
is separated by a leading white space:    The result is:    The punctuation

below,    
<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>MANUAL DOMAIN</a></h2>
   The address macro identifies an address construct.
                 The default width is 12n.    The  macro is used to specify
the name of the author of the item being documented, or the name of the
author of the actual manual page.                The default width is 12n.
 In the  section, the  command causes a line break allowing each new name
to appear on its own line. If this is not desirable,   .An -nosplit    call
will turn this off. To turn splitting back on, write   .An -split     The
 argument macro may be used whenever an argument is referenced. If called
without arguments, the  string is output.                    The default
width is 12n.    The  macro is used to demonstrate a  declaration for a
device interface in a section four manual.         In the  section a  command
causes a line break before and after its arguments are printed.   The default
width is 12n.    The command modifier is identical to the  (flag) command
with the exception that the  macro does not assert a dash in front of every
argument. Traditionally flags are marked by the preceding dash, however,
some commands or subsets of commands do not use them. Command modifiers
may also be specified in conjunction with interactive commands such as
editor commands. See   The default width is 10n.    A variable (or constant)
which is defined in an include file is specified by the macro         
   The default width is 12n.    The  errno macro specifies the error return
value for section 2, 3, and~9 library routines. The second example below
shows  used with the  general text domain macro, as it would be used in
a section two manual page.              The default width is 17n.    The
 macro specifies an environment variable.              The default width
is 15n.    The  macro handles command line flags. It prepends a dash,  to
the flag. For interactive command flags, which are not prepended with a
dash, the  (command modifier) macro is identical, but without the dash.
                      The  macro without any arguments results in a dash
representing stdin/stdout. Note that giving  a single dash will result in
two dashes.  The default width is 12n.    The  macro is used in the  section
with section two or three functions. It is neither callable nor parsed. 
       In the  section a  command causes a line break if a function has
already been presented and a break has not occurred. This leaves a nice
vertical space in between the previous function call and the declaration
for the next function.   The  macro, while in the  section, represents the
 statement, and is the short form of the above example. It specifies the
C~header file as being included in a C~program. It also causes a line break.
 While not in the  section, it represents the header file enclosed in angle
brackets.             This macro is intended for the  section. It may be
used anywhere else in the man page without problems, but its main purpose
is to present the function type in kernel normal form for the  of sections
two and three (it causes a line break, allowing the function name to appear
on the next line).           The   macro is modeled on  conventions.    
        Note that any call to another macro signals the end of the  call
(it will insert a closing parenthesis at that point).  For functions with
many parameters (which is rare), the macros  (function open) and  (function
close) may be used with  (function argument).  Example:   .Ft int .Fo res_mkquery
.Fa "int op" .Fa "char *dname" .Fa "int class" .Fa "int type" .Fa "char *data"
.Fa "int datalen" .Fa "struct rrec *newrr" .Fa "char *buf" .Fa "int buflen"
.Fc    Produces:                  In the  section, the function will always
begin at the beginning of line. If there is more than one function presented
in the  section and a function type has not been given, a line break will
occur, leaving a nice vertical space between the current function name
and the one prior.  The default width values of  and  are 12n and 16n, respectively.
   The  macro is used to refer to function arguments (parameters) outside
of the  section of the manual or inside the  section if the enclosure macros
 and  instead of  are used.  may also be used to refer to structure members.
           The default width is 12n.    The  macro generates text for use
in the  section.    For example,  produces:   # a small hack to suppress
a warning message     The  option is valid only for manual page sections~2
and~3. Currently, this macro does nothing if used without the  flag.    The

used for special characters, variable constants, etc. - anything which should
be displayed as it would be typed.                The default width is 16n.
   The  macro is used for the document title or subject name. It has the
peculiarity of remembering the first argument it was called with, which
should always be the subject name of the page. When called without arguments,
 regurgitates this initial name for the sole purpose of making less work
for the author. Note: A section two or three document function name is addressed
with the  in the  section, and with  in the  and remaining sections. For
interactive commands, such as the  command keyword in  the  macro should
be used. While  is nearly identical to  it can not recall the first argument
it was invoked with.                The default width is 10n.    The  macro
places option brackets around any remaining arguments on the command line,
and places any trailing punctuation outside the brackets. The macros  and
 (which produce an opening and a closing option bracket respectively) may
be used across one or more lines or to specify the exact position of the
closing parenthesis.                         Here a typical example of the
 and  macros:   .Oo .Op Fl k Ar kilobytes .Op Fl i Ar interval .Op Fl c Ar
count .Oc    Produces:           The default width values of  and  are 14n
and 10n, respectively.    The  macro formats path or file names. If called
without arguments, the  string is output, which represents the current
user&rsquo;s home directory.              The default width is 32n.    The  macro
replaces standard abbreviations with their formal names.    Available pairs
for  are:                    Part 1: System API                       
       Part 2: Shell and Utilities              X/Open                
             Miscellaneous           The  macro may be used whenever a
type is referenced. In the  section, it causes a line break (useful for
old style variable declarations).             Generic variable reference.
               The default width is 12n.    The  macro expects the first
argument to be a manual page name. The optional second argument, if a string
(defining the manual section), is put into parentheses.                The
default width is 10n.

the  macro (the latter takes no arguments). Font modes may be nested within
other font modes.   has the following syntax:     must be one of the following
three types:    Same as if the   macro was used for the entire block of
text.  Same as if the  macro was used for the entire block of text.  Same
as if the  macro was used for the entire block of text.   Both macros are
neither callable nor parsed.    The concept of enclosure is similar to quoting.
The object being to enclose one or more strings between a pair of characters
like quotes or parentheses. The terms quoting and enclosure are used interchangeably
throughout this document. Most of the one-line enclosure macros end in small
letter  to give a hint of quoting, but there are a few irregularities. For
each enclosure macro there is also a pair of open and close macros which
end in small letters  and  respectively.  # XXX                  All macros
ending with  and  have a default width value of 12n.    These macros expect
the first argument to be the opening and closing strings respectively. 
Due to the nine-argument limit in the original troff program two other macros
have been implemented which are now rather obsolete:  takes the first and
second parameter as the left and right enclosure string, which are then
used to enclose the arguments of  The default width value is 12n for both
macros.  The first and second arguments of this macro are the opening and
closing strings respectively, followed by the arguments to be enclosed.
 The quoted literal macro behaves differently in troff and nroff mode. If
formatted with  a quoted literal is always quoted. If formatted with troff,
an item is only quoted if the width of the item is less than three constant
width characters. This is to make short strings more visible where the font
change to literal (constant width) is less noticeable.  The default width
is 16n.  The prefix macro suppresses the whitespace between its first and
second argument:        The default width is 12n.  The  macro (see below)
performs the analogous suffix function.  The  macro inserts an apostrophe
and exits any special text modes, continuing in  mode.    Examples of quoting:
                                  For a good example of nested enclosure
macros, see the  option macro. It was created from the same underlying enclosure
macros as those presented in the list above. The  and  extended argument
list macros are discussed below.    The  macro can be used in a macro command
line for parameters which should  be formatted. Be careful to add  to the
word  if you really want that English word (and not the macro) as a parameter.
         The default width is 12n.    The  macro suppresses insertion of
a space between the current position and its first parameter. For example,
it is useful for old style argument lists where there is no space between
the flag and argument:          Note: The  macro always invokes the  macro
after eliminating the space unless another macro name follows it. If used
as a command (i.e., the second form above in the  line),  is identical to
    The  macro designates a reference to a section header within the same
document.          The default width is 16n.    The symbolic emphasis macro
is generally a boldface macro in either the symbolic sense or the traditional
English usage.          The default width is 6n.    Use this macro for mathematical
symbols and similar things.          The default width is 6n.    The following
macros make a modest attempt to handle references. At best, the macros make
it convenient to manually drop in a subset of  style references.    Reference

begins collection of reference information until the reference end macro

an argument list on a macro boundary for the  macro (see below). Note that

and three function calls. It should consist of a single  macro call; see
   The  section describes the typical usage of the subject of a man page.
The macros required are either   or  (and possibly    and  The function
name macro  is required for manual page sections~2 and~3; the command and
general name macro  is required for sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and~8. Section~4
manuals require a   or a  configuration device usage macro. Several other
macros may be necessary to produce the synopsis line as shown below:  
       The following macros were used:        In most cases the first text
in the  section is a brief paragraph on the command, function or file,
followed by a lexical list of options and respective explanations. To create
such a list, the  (begin list),  (list item) and  (end list) macros are
used (see  below).   Implementation specific information should be placed
here.   Sections 2, 3 and~9 function return values should go here. The  macro
may be used to generate text for use in the  section for most section 2
and 3 library functions; see     The following  section headers are part
of the preferred manual page layout and must be used appropriately to maintain
consistency. They are listed in the order in which they would be used.  
 The  section should reveal any related environment variables and clues
to their behavior and/or usage.   Files which are used or created by the
man page subject should be listed via the  macro in the  section.   There
are several ways to create examples. See the  section below for details.
  Diagnostic messages from a command should be placed in this section. The
 macro may be used to generate text for use in the  section for most section
1, 6 and~8 commands; see    Known compatibility issues (e.g. deprecated options
or parameters) should be listed here.   Specific error handling, especially
from library functions (man page sections 2, 3, and~9) should go here. The
 macro is used to specify an error (errno).   References to other material
on the man page topic and cross references to other relevant man pages
should be placed in the  section. Cross references are specified using the
 macro. Currently  style references are not accommodated.  It is recommended
that the cross references are sorted on the section number, then alphabetically
on the names within a section, and placed in that order and comma separated.
Example:        If the command, library function or file adheres to a specific
implementation such as  or  this should be noted here. If the command does
not adhere to any standard, its history should be noted in the  section.
  Any command which does not adhere to any specific standards should be
outlined historically in this section.   Credits should be placed here. Use
the  macro for names and the  macro for e-mail addresses within optional
contact information. Explicitly indicate whether the person authored the
initial manual page or the software or whatever the person is being credited

may be added; for example, this section was set with:   .Sh "PAGE STRUCTURE

headers:  is parsed but not generally callable. It can be used as an argument
in a call to  only; it then reactivates the default font for   The default
width is 8n.      The   paragraph command may be used to specify a line
space where necessary. The macro is not necessary after a  or  macro or
before a  or  macro (which both assert a vertical distance unless the 
flag is given).  The macro is neither callable nor parsed and takes no arguments;
an alternative name is                                                
                                                                      
       The only keep that is implemented at this time is for words. The
macros are  (begin keep) and  (end keep). The only option that  accepts

useful for preventing line breaks in the middle of options. In the example
for the make command line arguments (see  the keep prevented  from placing
up the flag and the argument on separate lines.  Both macros are neither

It allows the indentation (display) of one line of text. Its default font
is set to constant width (literal).  is parsed but not callable.    The above
was produced by:    Begin display. The  display must be ended with the 
macro. It has the following syntax:             Fill, but do not adjust
the right margin (only left-justify).  Center lines between the current left
and right margin. Note that each single line is centered.  Do not fill; display
a block of text as typed, using line breaks as specified by the user. This
can produce overlong lines without warning messages.  Display a filled block.
The block of text is formatted (i.e., the text is justified on both the left
and right side).  Display block with literal font (usually fixed-width). Useful
for source code or simple tabbed or spaced text.  The file whose name follows
the  flag is read and displayed before any data enclosed with  and  using
the selected display type. Any  commands in the file will be processed. 
If  is specified with one of the following strings, the string is interpreted
to indicate the level of indentation for the forthcoming block of text:
    Align block on the current left margin; this is the default mode of
  Supposedly center the block. At this time unfortunately, the block merely
gets left aligned about an imaginary center margin.  Indent by one default
indent value or tab. The default indent value is also used for the  and
  macros, so one is guaranteed the two types of displays will line up. The
indentation value is normally set to~6n or about two thirds of an inch
(six constant width characters).  Indent two times the default indent value.
 This  aligns the block about two inches from the right side of the page.
This macro needs work and perhaps may never do the right thing within 
   If  is a valid numeric expression instead   use that value for indentation.
The most useful scale indicators are  and  specifying the so-called  and
 This is approximately the width of the letters  and  respectively of the
current font (for nroff output, both scale indicators give the same values).
If  isn&rsquo;t a numeric expression, it is tested whether it is an  macro name,
and the default offset value associated with this macro is used. Finally,
if all tests fail, the width of  (typeset with a fixed-width font) is taken
as the offset.  Suppress insertion of vertical space before begin of display.
   End display (takes no arguments).     There are several types of lists
which may be initiated with the  begin-list macro. Items within the list
are specified with the  item macro, and each list must end with the  macro.
Lists may be nested within themselves and within displays. The use of columns
inside of lists or lists inside of columns is unproven.  In addition, several
list attributes may be specified such as the width of a tag, the list offset,
and compactness (blank lines between items allowed or disallowed). Most
of this document has been formatted with a tag style list   It has the

macros are ignored.  Hanged labels are a matter of taste.  Overhanging labels
are nice when space is constrained.  Inset labels are useful for controlling
blocks of paragraphs and are valuable for converting  manuals to other

 This list type generates multiple columns. The number of columns and the
width of each column is determined by the arguments to the  list,   etc.
If  starts with a  (dot) immediately followed by a valid  macro name, interpret
 and use the width of the result. Otherwise, the width of  (typeset with
a fixed-width font) is taken as the  column width.  Each  argument is parsed
to make a row, each column within the row is a separate argument separated
by a tab or the  macro.  The table:         was produced by:   .Bl -column
