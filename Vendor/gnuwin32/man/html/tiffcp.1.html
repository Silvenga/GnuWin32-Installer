<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
tiffcp - copy (and possibly convert) a <font size='-1'>TIFF</font>

file 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>tiffcp</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <i>src1.tif ... srcN.tif dst.tif</i> 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<i>tiffcp</i>
combines one or more files created according to the Tag Image File Format,
Revision 6.0 into a single <font size='-1'>TIFF</font>
 file. Because the output file may be compressed
using a different algorithm than the input files, <i>tiffcp</i> is most often
used to convert between different compression schemes. <p>
By default,  <i>tiffcp</i>
will copy all the understood tags in a <font size='-1'>TIFF</font>
 directory of an input file
to the associated directory in the output file. <p>
<i>tiffcp</i> can be used to reorganize
the storage characteristics of data in a file, but it is explicitly intended
to not alter or convert the image data content in any way. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>-b image</b>
</dt>
<dd>subtract the following monochrome image from all others processed.  This
can be used to remove a noise bias from a set of images.  This bias image
is typically an image of noise the camera saw with its shutter closed. </dd>

<dt><b>-B</b>
</dt>
<dd>Force output to be written with Big-Endian byte order. This option only has
an effect when the output file is created or overwritten and not when it
is appended to. </dd>

<dt><b>-C</b> </dt>
<dd>Suppress the use of &lsquo;&lsquo;strip chopping&rsquo;&rsquo; when reading images
that have a single strip/tile of uncompressed data. </dd>

<dt><b>-c</b> </dt>
<dd>Specify the compression
to use for data written to the output file: <b>none </b> for no compression, <b>packbits</b>
for PackBits compression, <b>lzw</b> for Lempel-Ziv &amp; Welch compression, <b>jpeg</b> for
baseline JPEG compression, <b>zip</b> for Deflate compression, <b>g3</b> for CCITT Group
3 (T.4) compression, and <b>g4</b> for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) compression. By default
<i>tiffcp</i> will compress data according to the value of the <i>Compression</i> tag
found in the source file. </dd>

<dt>The </dt>
<dd><font size='-1'>CCITT</font>
 Group 3 and Group 4 compression algorithms
can only be used with bilevel data. </dd>

<dt>Group 3 compression can be specified
together with several </dt>
<dd>T.4-specific options: <b>1d</b> for 1-dimensional encoding,
<b>2d</b> for 2-dimensional encoding, and <b>fill</b> to force each encoded scanline to
be zero-filled so that the terminating EOL code lies on a byte boundary.
Group 3-specific options are specified by appending a &lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;-separated list to
the &lsquo;&lsquo;g3&rsquo;&rsquo; option; e.g. <b>-c g3:2d:fill</b> to get 2D-encoded data with byte-aligned EOL
codes. <font size='-1'></font>
</dd>

<dt>LZW </dt>
<dd>compression can be specified together with a  <i>predictor</i> value.
A predictor value of 2 causes each scanline of the output image to undergo
horizontal differencing before it is encoded; a value of 1 forces each
scanline to be encoded without differencing. LZW-specific options are specified
by appending a &lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;-separated list to the &lsquo;&lsquo;lzw&rsquo;&rsquo; option; e.g. <b>-c lzw:2</b> for <font size='-1'>LZW</font>
 compression
with horizontal differencing. </dd>

<dt><b>-f</b> </dt>
<dd>Specify the bit fill order to use in writing
output data. By default, <i>tiffcp</i> will create a new file with the same fill
order as the original. Specifying <b>-f lsb2msb</b> will force data to be written
with the FillOrder tag set to <font size='-1'>LSB2MSB,</font>
 while <b>-f msb2lsb</b> will force data
to be written with the FillOrder tag set to <font size='-1'>MSB2LSB.</font>
 </dd>

<dt><b>-l</b> </dt>
<dd>Specify the length
of a tile (in pixels). <i>tiffcp</i> attempts to set the tile dimensions so that
no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile. </dd>

<dt><b>-L</b> </dt>
<dd>Force output to be
written with Little-Endian byte order. This option only has an effect when
the output file is created or overwritten and not when it is appended to.
</dd>

<dt><b>-M</b> </dt>
<dd>Suppress the use of memory-mapped files when reading images. </dd>

<dt><b>-p</b> </dt>
<dd>Specify
the planar configuration to use in writing image data that has one 8-bit
sample per pixel. By default, <i>tiffcp</i> will create a new file with the same
planar configuration as the original. Specifying <b>-p contig</b> will force data
to be written with multi-sample data packed together, while <b>-p separate</b> will
force samples to be written in separate planes. </dd>

<dt><b>-r</b> </dt>
<dd>Specify the number of
rows (scanlines) in each strip of data written to the output file. By default
(or when value <b>0</b> is specified), <i>tiffcp</i> attempts to set the rows/strip that
no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a strip. If you specify special
value <b>-1</b> it will results in infinite number of the rows per strip. The entire
image will be the one strip in that case. </dd>

<dt><b>-s</b> </dt>
<dd>Force the output file to be
written with data organized in strips (rather than tiles). </dd>

<dt><b>-t</b> </dt>
<dd>Force the output
file to be written with data organized in tiles (rather than strips). options
can be used to force the resultant image to be written as strips or tiles
of data, respectively. </dd>

<dt><b>-w</b> </dt>
<dd>Specify the width of a tile (in pixels). <i>tiffcp</i>
attempts to set the tile dimensions so that no more than 8 kilobytes of
data appear in a tile. <i>tiffcp</i> attempts to set the tile dimensions so that
no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile. </dd>

<dt><b>-,={character}</b> </dt>
<dd>substitute
{character} for &rsquo;,&rsquo; in parsing image directory indices in files.  This is
necessary if filenames contain commas. Note that &rsquo;,=&rsquo; with whitespace immediately
following will disable the special meaning of the &rsquo;,&rsquo; entirely.  See examples.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Examples</a></h2>
The following concatenates two files and writes the result using
 <font size='-1'>LZW</font>
 encoding: <blockquote><br>
<pre>tiffcp -c lzw a.tif b.tif result.tif
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
To convert a G3 1d-encoded  <font size='-1'>TIFF</font>
 to a single strip of G4-encoded data the
following might be used: <blockquote><br>
<pre>tiffcp -c g4 -r 10000 g3.tif g4.tif
</pre></blockquote>
(1000 is just a number that is larger than the number of rows in the source
file.) 
<p> To extract a selected set of images from a multi-image TIFF file,
the file name may be immediately followed by a &rsquo;,&rsquo;  separated list of image
directory indices.  The first image is always in directory 0.  Thus, to copy
the 1st and 3rd images of image file "album.tif" to "result.tif": <blockquote><br>
<pre>tiffcp album.tif,0,2 result.tif
</pre></blockquote>

<p> Given file "CCD.tif" whose first image is a noise bias followed by images
which include that bias, subtract the noise from all those images following
it (while decompressing) with the command: <blockquote><br>
<pre>tiffcp -c none -b CCD.tif CCD.tif,1, result.tif
</pre></blockquote>

<p> If the file above were named "CCD,X.tif", the "-,=" option would be required
to correctly parse this filename with image numbers, as follows: <blockquote><br>
<pre>tiffcp -c none -,=% -b CCD,X.tif CCD,X%1%.tif result.tif
