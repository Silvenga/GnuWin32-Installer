<p>
The <i>dlopen</i>() function shall make an executable object file
specified by <i>file</i> available to the calling program. The class of files eligible
for this operation and the manner of their construction are implementation-defined,
though typically such files are executable objects such as shared libraries,
relocatable files, or programs. Note that some implementations permit the
construction of dependencies between such objects that are embedded within
files. In such cases, a <i>dlopen</i>() operation shall load such dependencies
in addition to the object referenced by <i>file</i>. Implementations may also impose
specific constraints on the construction of programs that can employ <i>dlopen</i>()
and its related services. <p>
A successful <i>dlopen</i>() shall return a <i>handle</i> which
the caller may use on subsequent calls to <i>dlsym</i>() and <i>dlclose</i>(). The value
of this <i>handle</i> should not be interpreted in any way by the caller. <p>
The <i>file</i>
argument is used to construct a pathname to the object file. If <i>file</i> contains
a slash character, the <i>file</i> argument is used as the pathname for the file.
Otherwise, <i>file</i> is used in an implementation-defined manner to yield a pathname.
<p>
If the value of <i>file</i> is 0, <i>dlopen</i>() shall provide a <i>handle</i> on a global
symbol object. This object shall provide access to the symbols from an ordered
set of objects consisting of the original program image file, together
with any objects loaded at program start-up as specified by that process
image file (for example, shared libraries), and the set of objects loaded
using a <i>dlopen</i>() operation together with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag. As the latter
set of objects can change during execution, the set identified by <i>handle</i>
can also change dynamically. <p>
Only a single copy of an object file is brought
into the address space, even if <i>dlopen</i>() is invoked multiple times in reference
to the file, and even if different pathnames are used to reference the
file. <p>
The <i>mode</i> parameter describes how <i>dlopen</i>() shall operate upon <i>file</i>
with respect to the processing of relocations and the scope of visibility
of the symbols provided within <i>file</i>. When an object is brought into the
address space of a process, it may contain references to symbols whose
addresses are not known until the object is loaded. These references shall
be relocated before the symbols can be accessed. The <i>mode</i> parameter governs
when these relocations take place and may have the following values: 
<dl>

<dt>RTLD_LAZY
</dt>
<dd>Relocations shall be performed at an implementation-defined time, ranging
from the time of the <i>dlopen</i>() call until the first reference to a given
symbol occurs. Specifying RTLD_LAZY should improve performance on implementations
supporting dynamic symbol binding as a process may not reference all of
the functions in any given object. And, for systems supporting dynamic symbol
resolution for normal process execution, this behavior mimics the normal
handling of process execution. </dd>

<dt>RTLD_NOW </dt>
<dd>All necessary relocations shall
be performed when the object is first loaded. This may waste some processing
if relocations are performed for functions that are never referenced. This
behavior may be useful for applications that need to know as soon as an
object is loaded that all symbols referenced during execution are available.
<p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Any object loaded by <i>dlopen</i>() that requires relocations against global
symbols can reference the symbols in the original process image file, any
objects loaded at program start-up, from the object itself as well as any
other object included in the same <i>dlopen</i>() invocation, and any objects
that were loaded in any <i>dlopen</i>() invocation and which specified the RTLD_GLOBAL
flag. To determine the scope of visibility for the symbols loaded with a
<i>dlopen</i>() invocation, the <i>mode</i> parameter should be a bitwise-inclusive OR
with one of the following values: 
<dl>

<dt>RTLD_GLOBAL </dt>
<dd>The object&rsquo;s symbols shall
be made available for the relocation processing of any other object. In
addition, symbol lookup using <i>dlopen</i>(<i>0, mode</i>) and an associated <i>dlsym</i>()
allows objects loaded with this <i>mode</i> to be searched. </dd>

<dt>RTLD_LOCAL </dt>
<dd>The object&rsquo;s
symbols shall not be made available for the relocation processing of any
other object. <p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
If neither RTLD_GLOBAL nor RTLD_LOCAL are specified, then
an implementation-defined default behavior shall be applied. <p>
If a <i>file</i> is
specified in multiple <i>dlopen</i>() invocations, <i>mode</i> is interpreted at each
invocation. Note, however, that once RTLD_NOW has been specified all relocations
shall have been completed rendering further RTLD_NOW operations redundant
and any further RTLD_LAZY operations irrelevant. Similarly, note that once
RTLD_GLOBAL has been specified the object shall maintain the RTLD_GLOBAL
status regardless of any previous or future specification of RTLD_LOCAL,
as long as the object remains in the address space (see <i>dlclose</i>()). <p>
Symbols
introduced into a program through calls to <i>dlopen</i>() may be used in relocation
activities. Symbols so introduced may duplicate symbols already defined
by the program or previous <i>dlopen</i>() operations. To resolve the ambiguities
such a situation might present, the resolution of a symbol reference to
symbol definition is based on a symbol resolution order. Two such resolution
orders are defined: <i>load</i> or <i>dependency</i> ordering. Load order establishes
an ordering among symbol definitions, such that the definition first loaded
(including definitions from the image file and any dependent objects loaded
with it) has priority over objects added later (via <i>dlopen</i>()). Load ordering
is used in relocation processing. Dependency ordering uses a breadth-first
order starting with a given object, then all of its dependencies, then
any dependents of those, iterating until all dependencies are satisfied.
With the exception of the global symbol object obtained via a <i>dlopen</i>()
operation on a <i>file</i> of 0, dependency ordering is used by the <i>dlsym</i>() function.
Load ordering is used in <i>dlsym</i>() operations upon the global symbol object.
<p>
When an object is first made accessible via <i>dlopen</i>() it and its dependent
objects are added in dependency order. Once all the objects are added, relocations
are performed using load order. Note that if an object or its dependencies
had been previously loaded, the load and dependency orders may yield different
resolutions. <p>
The symbols introduced by <i>dlopen</i>() operations and available
through <i>dlsym</i>() are at a minimum those which are exported as symbols of
global scope by the object. Typically such symbols shall be those that were
specified in (for example) C source code as having <i>extern</i> linkage. The precise
manner in which an implementation constructs the set of exported symbols
for a <i>dlopen</i>() object is specified by that implementation. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Return Value</a></h2>
<p>
If
<i>file</i> cannot be found, cannot be opened for reading, is not of an appropriate
object format for processing by <i>dlopen</i>(), or if an error occurs during
the process of loading <i>file</i> or relocating its symbolic references, <i>dlopen</i>()
shall return NULL. More detailed diagnostic information shall be available
through <i>dlerror</i>().
