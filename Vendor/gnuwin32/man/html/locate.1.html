<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
This
manual page documents the GNU version of <b>locate</b>. For each given pattern,
<b>locate</b> searches one or more databases of file names and displays the file
names that contain the pattern.  Patterns can contain shell-style metacharacters:
&lsquo;*&rsquo;, &lsquo;?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;[]&rsquo;.  The metacharacters do not treat &lsquo;/&rsquo; or &lsquo;.&rsquo;  specially.  Therefore,
a pattern &lsquo;foo*bar&rsquo; can match a file name that contains &lsquo;foo3/bar&rsquo;, and a pattern
&lsquo;*duck*&rsquo; can match a file name that contains &lsquo;lake/.ducky&rsquo;.  Patterns that contain
metacharacters should be quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell.
<p>
If a pattern is a plain string -- it contains no metacharacters -- <b>locate</b> displays
all file names in the database that contain that string anywhere.  If a
pattern does contain metacharacters, <b>locate</b> only displays file names that
match the pattern exactly.  As a result, patterns that contain metacharacters
should usually begin with a &lsquo;*&rsquo;, and will most often end with one as well.
 The exceptions are patterns that are intended to explicitly match the
beginning or end of a file name. <p>
The file name databases contain lists of
files that were on the system when the databases were last updated.  The
system administrator can choose the file name of the default database,
the frequency with which the databases are updated, and the directories
for which they contain entries; see <a href='updatedb.1.html'><b>updatedb</b>(1)</a>
. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><i>-c, --count</i> </dt>
<dd>Instead
of printing the matched filenames, just print the total  number of matches
we found. </dd>

<dt><i>-d <i>path</i>, --database=<i>path</i></i> </dt>
<dd>Instead of searching the default file name
database, search the file name databases in <i>path</i>, which is a colon-separated
list of database file names.  You can also use the environment variable
<b>LOCATE_PATH</b> to set the list of database files to search. The option overrides
the environment variable if both are used.  Empty elements in the path are
taken to be synonyms for the file name of the default database. </dd>

<dt>The file
name database format changed starting with GNU </dt>
<dd><b>find</b> and <b>locate</b> version
4.0 to allow machines with diffent byte orderings to share the databases.
 This version of <b>locate</b> can automatically recognize and read databases
produced for older versions of GNU <b>locate</b> or Unix versions of <b>locate</b> or
<b>find</b>. Support for the old locate database format will be discontinued in
a future release. </dd>

<dt><i>-e, --existing</i> </dt>
<dd>Only print out such names that currently exist
(instead of such names that existed when the database was created). Note
that this may slow down the program a lot, if there are many matches in
the database.  If you are using this option within a program, please note
that it is possible for the file to be deleted after  <b>locate </b> has checked
that it exists, but before you use it. </dd>

<dt><i>-L, --follow</i> </dt>
<dd>If testing for the existence
of files (with the -e option), omit broken symbolic links.   This is the
default. </dd>

<dt><i>-P, -H, --nofollow</i> </dt>
<dd>If testing for the existence of files (with the
-e option), treat broken symbolic links count as if they were exiting files.
 The -H form of this option is provided purely for similarity with <b>find</b>;
the use of -P is recommended over -H. </dd>

<dt><i>-i, --ignore-case</i> </dt>
<dd>Ignore case distinctions
in both the pattern and the file names. </dd>

<dt><i>-l N, --limit=N</i> </dt>
<dd>Limit the number of
matches to N.  If a limit is set via this option, the number of results
printed for the -c option will never be larger than this number. </dd>

<dt><i>-m, --mmap</i>
</dt>
<dd>Accepted but does nothing, for compatibility with BSD  <b>locate</b>. </dd>

<dt><i>-0, --null</i> </dt>
<dd>Use
ASCII NUL as a separator, instead of newline.    </dd>

<dt><i>-w, --wholename</i> </dt>
<dd>Match against
the whole name of the file as listed in the database. This is the default.
</dd>

<dt><i>-b, --basename</i> </dt>
<dd>Results are considered to match if the pattern specified matches
the final component of the name of a file as listed in the database. This
final component is usually referred to as the &lsquo;base name&rsquo;. </dd>

<dt><i>-r, --regex </i> </dt>
<dd>The pattern
specified on the command line is understood to be a POSIX exteded regular
expression, as opposed to a glob pattern.  Filenames whose full paths match
the specified regular expression are printed (or, in the case of the -c
option, counted).  If you wish to anchor your regular expression at the
ends of the full path name, then as is usual with regular expressions,
you should use the characters ^ and $ to signify this.   Newline is not considered
to be special. </dd>

<dt><i>-s, --stdio</i> </dt>
<dd>Accepted but does nothing, for compatibility with
BSD  <b>locate</b>. </dd>

<dt><i>-S, --statistics</i> </dt>
<dd>Print various statistics about each locate database
and then exit without performing a search.  Any patterns given on the command
line are ignored.  For compatibility with BSD, -S is accepted as a synonym
for --statistics. </dd>

<dt><i>--help</i> </dt>
<dd>Print a summary of the options to <b>locate</b> and exit. </dd>

<dt><i>--version</i>
</dt>
<dd>Print the version number of <b>locate</b> and exit. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Environment</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>LOCATE_PATH</b> </dt>
<dd>Colon-separated
list of databases to search.  If the value has a leading or trailing colon,
or has two colons in a row, you may get results that vary between different
versions of  <b>locate</b>. 
<p> </dd>

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Bugs</a></h2>
<p>
The locate
database correctly handles filenames containing newlines, but only if the
system&rsquo;s sort command has a working <i>-z</i> option.  If you suspect that  <b>locate</b>
may need to return filenames containing newlines, consider using its <i>--null</i>
 option. <p>
The best way to report a bug is to use the form at <a href='http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=findutils.'>http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=findutils.</a>

  The reason for this is that you will then be able to track progress in
fixing the problem.   Other comments about <a href='locate.1.html'><b>locate</b>(1)</a>
 and about the findutils
package in general can be sent to the  <i>bug-findutils</i> mailing list.  To join
