<B>pnmnoraw</B> - replaced by pnmtoplainpnm
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.
<p><b>pnmnoraw</b> was replaced in Netpbm 8.2 (March 2000) by <b><a
href="pnmtoplainpnm.html">pnmtoplainpnm</a></b>, which was obsoleted by
<b>pnmtopnm</b> in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).

<P><B>pnmtoplainpnm</b> was actually the same program; it was just renamed
to make it clear that is just a format converter.

<P><B>pnmtopnm</b> is more general, in that it can go both directions.
<b>pnmtopnm -plain</b> is the same as <b>pnmnoraw</b>.
