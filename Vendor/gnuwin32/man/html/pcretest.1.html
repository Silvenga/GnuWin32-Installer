<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
pcretest - a program for testing Perl-compatible regular expressions.

<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
 <p>
<b>pcretest "[options] [source] [destination]"</b> <p>
<b>pcretest</b> was written
as a test program for the PCRE regular expression library itself, but it
can also be used for experimenting with regular expressions. This document
describes the features of the test program; for details of the regular
expressions themselves, see the  <b>pcrepattern</b>  documentation. For details
of the PCRE library function calls and their options, see the  <b>pcreapi</b>
 documentation.   
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Options</a></h2>
 
<dl>

<dt><b>-b</b> </dt>
<dd>Behave as if each regex has the <b>/B</b> (show bytecode)
modifier; the internal form is output after compilation. </dd>

<dt><b>-C</b> </dt>
<dd>Output the version
number of the PCRE library, and all available information about the optional
features that are included, and then exit. </dd>

<dt><b>-d</b> </dt>
<dd>Behave as if each regex has
the <b>/D</b> (debug) modifier; the internal form and information about the compiled
pattern is output after compilation; <b>-d</b> is equivalent to <b>-b -i</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-dfa</b> </dt>
<dd>Behave
as if each data line contains the \D escape sequence; this causes the alternative
matching function, <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>, to be used instead of the standard
<b>pcre_exec()</b> function (more detail is given below). </dd>

<dt><b>-help</b> </dt>
<dd>Output a brief summary
these options and then exit. </dd>

<dt><b>-i</b> </dt>
<dd>Behave as if each regex has the <b>/I</b> modifier;
information about the compiled pattern is given after compilation. </dd>

<dt><b>-m</b> </dt>
<dd>Output
the size of each compiled pattern after it has been compiled. This is equivalent
to adding <b>/M</b> to each regular expression. For compatibility with earlier
versions of pcretest, <b>-s</b> is a synonym for <b>-m</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-o</b> <i>osize</i> </dt>
<dd>Set the number of elements
in the output vector that is used when calling <b>pcre_exec()</b> or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>
to be <i>osize</i>. The default value is 45, which is enough for 14 capturing subexpressions
for <b>pcre_exec()</b> or 22 different matches for <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>. The vector
size can be changed for individual matching calls by including \O in the
data line (see below). </dd>

<dt><b>-p</b> </dt>
<dd>Behave as if each regex has the <b>/P</b> modifier; the
POSIX wrapper API is used to call PCRE. None of the other options has any
effect when <b>-p</b> is set. </dd>

<dt><b>-q</b> </dt>
<dd>Do not output the version number of <b>pcretest</b> at
the start of execution. </dd>

<dt><b>-S</b> <i>size</i> </dt>
<dd>On Unix-like systems, set the size of the
runtime stack to <i>size</i> megabytes. </dd>

<dt><b>-t</b> </dt>
<dd>Run each compile, study, and match many
times with a timer, and output resulting time per compile or match (in
milliseconds). Do not set <b>-m</b> with <b>-t</b>, because you will then get the size output
a zillion times, and the timing will be distorted. You can control the number
of iterations that are used for timing by following <b>-t</b> with a number (as
a separate item on the command line). For example, "-t 1000" would iterate
1000 times. The default is to iterate 500000 times. </dd>

<dt><b>-tm</b> </dt>
<dd>This is like <b>-t</b> except
that it times only the matching phase, not the compile or study phases.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
 <p>
If <b>pcretest</b> is given two filename arguments, it reads from
the first and writes to the second. If it is given only one filename argument,
it reads from that file and writes to stdout. Otherwise, it reads from stdin
and writes to stdout, and prompts for each line of input, using "re&gt;" to
prompt for regular expressions, and "data&gt;" to prompt for data lines. <p>
The
program handles any number of sets of input on a single input file. Each
set starts with a regular expression, and continues with any number of
data lines to be matched against the pattern. <p>
Each data line is matched
separately and independently. If you want to do multi-line matches, you have
to use the \n escape sequence (or \r or \r\n, etc., depending on the newline
setting) in a single line of input to encode the newline sequences. There
is no limit on the length of data lines; the input buffer is automatically
extended if it is too small. <p>
An empty line signals the end of the data lines,
at which point a new regular expression is read. The regular expressions
are given enclosed in any non-alphanumeric delimiters other than backslash,
for example: <p>
  /(a|bc)x+yz/<br>
 <p>
White space before the initial delimiter is ignored. A regular expression
may be continued over several input lines, in which case the newline characters
are included within it. It is possible to include the delimiter within the
pattern by escaping it, for example <p>
  /abc\/def/<br>
 <p>
If you do so, the escape and the delimiter form part of the pattern, but
since delimiters are always non-alphanumeric, this does not affect its interpretation.
If the terminating delimiter is immediately followed by a backslash, for
example, <p>
  /abc/\<br>
 <p>
then a backslash is added to the end of the pattern. This is done to provide
a way of testing the error condition that arises if a pattern finishes
with a backslash, because <p>
  /abc\/<br>
 <p>
is interpreted as the first line of a pattern that starts with "abc/",
causing pcretest to read the next line as a continuation of the regular
expression.   
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Pattern Modifiers</a></h2>
 <p>
A pattern may be followed by any number
of modifiers, which are mostly single characters. Following Perl usage,
these are referred to below as, for example, "the <b>/i</b> modifier", even though
the delimiter of the pattern need not always be a slash, and no slash is
used when writing modifiers. Whitespace may appear between the final pattern
delimiter and the first modifier, and between the modifiers themselves.
<p>
The <b>/i</b>, <b>/m</b>, <b>/s</b>, and <b>/x</b> modifiers set the PCRE_CASELESS, PCRE_MULTILINE,
PCRE_DOTALL, or PCRE_EXTENDED options, respectively, when <b>pcre_compile()</b>
is called. These four modifier letters have the same effect as they do in
Perl. For example: <p>
  /caseless/i<br>
 <p>
The following table shows additional modifiers for setting PCRE options
that do not correspond to anything in Perl: <p>
  <b>/A</b>       PCRE_ANCHORED<br>
   <b>/C</b>       PCRE_AUTO_CALLOUT<br>
   <b>/E</b>       PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY<br>
   <b>/f</b>       PCRE_FIRSTLINE<br>
   <b>/J</b>       PCRE_DUPNAMES<br>
   <b>/N</b>       PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE<br>
   <b>/U</b>       PCRE_UNGREEDY<br>
   <b>/X</b>       PCRE_EXTRA<br>
   <b>/&lt;cr&gt;</b>    PCRE_NEWLINE_CR<br>
   <b>/&lt;lf&gt;</b>    PCRE_NEWLINE_LF<br>
   <b>/&lt;crlf&gt;</b>  PCRE_NEWLINE_CRLF<br>
   <b>/&lt;any&gt;</b>   PCRE_NEWLINE_ANY<br>
 <p>
Those specifying line ending sequencess are literal strings as shown. This
example sets multiline matching with CRLF as the line ending sequence:
<p>
  /^abc/m&lt;crlf&gt;<br>
 <p>
Details of the meanings of these PCRE options are given in the  <b>pcreapi</b>
 documentation.   
<h3><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Finding all matches in a string</a></h3>
 <p>
Searching for all possible
matches within each subject string can be requested by the <b>/g</b> or <b>/G</b> modifier.
After finding a match, PCRE is called again to search the remainder of
the subject string. The difference between <b>/g</b> and <b>/G</b> is that the former
uses the <i>startoffset</i> argument to <b>pcre_exec()</b> to start searching at a new
point within the entire string (which is in effect what Perl does), whereas
the latter passes over a shortened substring. This makes a difference to
the matching process if the pattern begins with a lookbehind assertion
(including \b or \B). <p>
If any call to <b>pcre_exec()</b> in a <b>/g</b> or <b>/G</b> sequence matches
an empty string, the next call is done with the PCRE_NOTEMPTY and PCRE_ANCHORED
flags set in order to search for another, non-empty, match at the same point.
If this second match fails, the start offset is advanced by one, and the
normal match is retried. This imitates the way Perl handles such cases when
using the <b>/g</b> modifier or the <b>split()</b> function.   
<h3><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Other modifiers</a></h3>
 <p>
There are
yet more modifiers for controlling the way <b>pcretest</b> operates. <p>
The <b>/+</b> modifier
requests that as well as outputting the substring that matched the entire
pattern, pcretest should in addition output the remainder of the subject
string. This is useful for tests where the subject contains multiple copies
of the same substring. <p>
The <b>/B</b> modifier is a debugging feature. It requests
that <b>pcretest</b> output a representation of the compiled byte code after compilation.
<p>
The <b>/L</b> modifier must be followed directly by the name of a locale, for
example, <p>
  /pattern/Lfr_FR<br>
 <p>
For this reason, it must be the last modifier. The given locale is set,
<b>pcre_maketables()</b> is called to build a set of character tables for the
locale, and this is then passed to <b>pcre_compile()</b> when compiling the regular
expression. Without an <b>/L</b> modifier, NULL is passed as the tables pointer;
that is, <b>/L</b> applies only to the expression on which it appears. <p>
The <b>/I</b> modifier
requests that <b>pcretest</b> output information about the compiled pattern (whether
it is anchored, has a fixed first character, and so on). It does this by
calling <b>pcre_fullinfo()</b> after compiling a pattern. If the pattern is studied,
the results of that are also output. <p>
The <b>/D</b> modifier is a PCRE debugging
feature, and is equivalent to <b>/BI</b>, that is, both the /B and the <b>/I</b> modifiers.
<p>
The <b>/F</b> modifier causes <b>pcretest</b> to flip the byte order of the fields in
the compiled pattern that contain 2-byte and 4-byte numbers. This facility
is for testing the feature in PCRE that allows it to execute patterns that
were compiled on a host with a different endianness. This feature is not
available when the POSIX interface to PCRE is being used, that is, when
the <b>/P</b> pattern modifier is specified. See also the section about saving
and reloading compiled patterns below. <p>
The <b>/S</b> modifier causes <b>pcre_study()</b>
to be called after the expression has been compiled, and the results used
when the expression is matched. <p>
The <b>/M</b> modifier causes the size of memory
block used to hold the compiled pattern to be output. <p>
The <b>/P</b> modifier causes
<b>pcretest</b> to call PCRE via the POSIX wrapper API rather than its native
API. When this is done, all other modifiers except <b>/i</b>, <b>/m</b>, and <b>/+</b> are ignored.
REG_ICASE is set if <b>/i</b> is present, and REG_NEWLINE is set if <b>/m</b> is present.
The wrapper functions force PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY always, and PCRE_DOTALL
unless REG_NEWLINE is set. <p>
The <b>/8</b> modifier causes <b>pcretest</b> to call PCRE
with the PCRE_UTF8 option set. This turns on support for UTF-8 character
handling in PCRE, provided that it was compiled with this support enabled.
This modifier also causes any non-printing characters in output strings
to be printed using the \x{hh...} notation if they are valid UTF-8 sequences.
<p>
If the <b>/?</b> modifier is used with <b>/8</b>, it causes <b>pcretest</b> to call <b>pcre_compile()</b>
with the PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK option, to suppress the checking of the string
for UTF-8 validity.   
<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Data Lines</a></h2>
 <p>
Before each data line is passed to <b>pcre_exec()</b>,
leading and trailing whitespace is removed, and it is then scanned for
\ escapes. Some of these are pretty esoteric features, intended for checking
out some of the more complicated features of PCRE. If you are just testing
"ordinary" regular expressions, you probably don&rsquo;t need any of these. The
following escapes are recognized: <p>
  \a         alarm (BEL, \x07)<br>
   \b         backspace (\x08)<br>
   \e         escape (\x27)<br>
   \f         formfeed (\x0c)<br>
   \n         newline (\x0a)<br>
    \qdd       set the PCRE_MATCH_LIMIT limit to dd<br>
                (any number of digits)<br>
   \r         carriage return (\x0d)<br>
   \t         tab (\x09)<br>
   \v         vertical tab (\x0b)<br>
   \nnn       octal character (up to 3 octal digits)<br>
   \xhh       hexadecimal character (up to 2 hex digits)<br>
    \x{hh...}  hexadecimal character, any number of digits<br>
                in UTF-8 mode<br>
    \A         pass the PCRE_ANCHORED option to <b>pcre_exec()</b><br>
                or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
    \B         pass the PCRE_NOTBOL option to <b>pcre_exec()</b><br>
                or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
    \Cdd       call pcre_copy_substring() for substring dd<br>
                after a successful match (number less than 32)<br>
    \Cname     call pcre_copy_named_substring() for substring<br>
                "name" after a successful match (name termin-<br>
                ated by next non alphanumeric character)<br>
    \C+        show the current captured substrings at callout<br>
                time<br>
   \C-        do not supply a callout function<br>
    \C!n       return 1 instead of 0 when callout number n is<br>
                reached<br>
    \C!n!m     return 1 instead of 0 when callout number n is<br>
                reached for the nth time<br>
    \C*n       pass the number n (may be negative) as callout<br>
                data; this is used as the callout return value<br>
   \D         use the <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b> match function<br>
   \F         only shortest match for <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
    \Gdd       call pcre_get_substring() for substring dd<br>
                after a successful match (number less than 32)<br>
    \Gname     call pcre_get_named_substring() for substring<br>
                "name" after a successful match (name termin-<br>
                ated by next non-alphanumeric character)<br>
    \L         call pcre_get_substringlist() after a<br>
                successful match<br>
    \M         discover the minimum MATCH_LIMIT and<br>
                MATCH_LIMIT_RECURSION settings<br>
    \N         pass the PCRE_NOTEMPTY option to <b>pcre_exec()</b><br>
                or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
    \Odd       set the size of the output vector passed to<br>
                <b>pcre_exec()</b> to dd (any number of digits)<br>
    \P         pass the PCRE_PARTIAL option to <b>pcre_exec()</b><br>
                or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
    \Qdd       set the PCRE_MATCH_LIMIT_RECURSION limit to dd<br>
                (any number of digits)<br>
   \R         pass the PCRE_DFA_RESTART option to <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
   \S         output details of memory get/free calls during matching<br>
    \Z         pass the PCRE_NOTEOL option to <b>pcre_exec()</b><br>
                or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
    \?         pass the PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK option to<br>
                <b>pcre_exec()</b> or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
   \&gt;dd       start the match at offset dd (any number of digits);<br>
                 this sets the <i>startoffset</i> argument for <b>pcre_exec()</b><br>
                or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
    \&lt;cr&gt;      pass the PCRE_NEWLINE_CR option to <b>pcre_exec()</b><br>
                or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
    \&lt;lf&gt;      pass the PCRE_NEWLINE_LF option to <b>pcre_exec()</b><br>
                or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
    \&lt;crlf&gt;    pass the PCRE_NEWLINE_CRLF option to <b>pcre_exec()</b><br>
                or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
    \&lt;any&gt;     pass the PCRE_NEWLINE_ANY option to <b>pcre_exec()</b><br>
                or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b><br>
 <p>
The escapes that specify line ending sequences are literal strings, exactly
as shown. No more than one newline setting should be present in any data
line. <p>
A backslash followed by anything else just escapes the anything else.
If the very last character is a backslash, it is ignored. This gives a way
of passing an empty line as data, since a real empty line terminates the
data input. <p>
If \M is present, <b>pcretest</b> calls <b>pcre_exec()</b> several times, with
different values in the <i>match_limit</i> and <i>match_limit_recursion</i> fields of
the <b>pcre_extra</b> data structure, until it finds the minimum numbers for each
parameter that allow <b>pcre_exec()</b> to complete. The <i>match_limit</i> number is
a measure of the amount of backtracking that takes place, and checking
it out can be instructive. For most simple matches, the number is quite
small, but for patterns with very large numbers of matching possibilities,
it can become large very quickly with increasing length of subject string.
The <i>match_limit_recursion</i> number is a measure of how much stack (or, if
PCRE is compiled with NO_RECURSE, how much heap) memory is needed to complete
the match attempt. <p>
When \O is used, the value specified may be higher or
lower than the size set by the <b>-O</b> command line option (or defaulted to 45);
\O applies only to the call of <b>pcre_exec()</b> for the line in which it appears.
<p>
If the <b>/P</b> modifier was present on the pattern, causing the POSIX wrapper
API to be used, the only option-setting sequences that have any effect are
\B and \Z, causing REG_NOTBOL and REG_NOTEOL, respectively, to be passed
to <b>regexec()</b>. <p>
The use of \x{hh...} to represent UTF-8 characters is not dependent
on the use of the <b>/8</b> modifier on the pattern. It is recognized always. There
may be any number of hexadecimal digits inside the braces. The result is
from one to six bytes, encoded according to the UTF-8 rules.   
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>the Alternative
Matching Function</a></h2>
 <p>
By default, <b>pcretest</b> uses the standard PCRE matching
function, <b>pcre_exec()</b> to match each data line. From release 6.0, PCRE supports
an alternative matching function, <b>pcre_dfa_test()</b>, which operates in a
different way, and has some restrictions. The differences between the two
functions are described in the  <b>pcrematching</b>  documentation. <p>
If a data line
contains the \D escape sequence, or if the command line contains the <b>-dfa</b>
option, the alternative matching function is called. This function finds
all possible matches at a given point. If, however, the \F escape sequence
is present in the data line, it stops after the first match is found. This
is always the shortest possible match.   
<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Default Output from Pcretest</a></h2>
 <p>
This
section describes the output when the normal matching function, <b>pcre_exec()</b>,
is being used. <p>
When a match succeeds, pcretest outputs the list of captured
substrings that <b>pcre_exec()</b> returns, starting with number 0 for the string
that matched the whole pattern. Otherwise, it outputs "No match" or "Partial
match" when <b>pcre_exec()</b> returns PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH or PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL,
respectively, and otherwise the PCRE negative error number. Here is an example
of an interactive <b>pcretest</b> run. <p>
  $ pcretest<br>
   PCRE version 7.0 30-Nov-2006<br>
 <p>
    re&gt; /^abc(\d+)/<br>
   data&gt; abc123<br>
    0: abc123<br>
    1: 123<br>
   data&gt; xyz<br>
   No match<br>
 <p>
If the strings contain any non-printing characters, they are output as
\0x escapes, or as \x{...} escapes if the <b>/8</b> modifier was present on the pattern.
See below for the definition of non-printing characters. If the pattern has
the <b>/+</b> modifier, the output for substring 0 is followed by the the rest
of the subject string, identified by "0+" like this: <p>
    re&gt; /cat/+<br>
   data&gt; cataract<br>
    0: cat<br>
    0+ aract<br>
 <p>
If the pattern has the <b>/g</b> or <b>/G</b> modifier, the results of successive matching
attempts are output in sequence, like this: <p>
    re&gt; /\Bi(\w\w)/g<br>
   data&gt; Mississippi<br>
    0: iss<br>
    1: ss<br>
    0: iss<br>
    1: ss<br>
    0: ipp<br>
    1: pp<br>
 <p>
"No match" is output only if the first match attempt fails. <p>
If any of the
sequences <b>\C</b>, <b>\G</b>, or <b>\L</b> are present in a data line that is successfully matched,
the substrings extracted by the convenience functions are output with C,
G, or L after the string number instead of a colon. This is in addition
to the normal full list. The string length (that is, the return from the
extraction function) is given in parentheses after each string for <b>\C</b> and
<b>\G</b>. <p>
Note that whereas patterns can be continued over several lines (a plain
"&gt;" prompt is used for continuations), data lines may not. However newlines
can be included in data by means of the \n escape (or \r, \r\n, etc., depending
on the newline sequence setting).    
<h2><a name='sect10' href='#toc10'>Output from the Alternative Matching
Function</a></h2>
 <p>
When the alternative matching function, <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>, is used
(by means of the \D escape sequence or the <b>-dfa</b> command line option), the
output consists of a list of all the matches that start at the first point
in the subject where there is at least one match. For example: <p>
    re&gt; /(tang|tangerine|tan)/<br>
   data&gt; yellow tangerine\D<br>
    0: tangerine<br>
    1: tang<br>
    2: tan<br>
 <p>
(Using the normal matching function on this data finds only "tang".) The
longest matching string is always given first (and numbered zero). <p>
If <b>/g</b>
is present on the pattern, the search for further matches resumes at the
end of the longest match. For example: <p>
    re&gt; /(tang|tangerine|tan)/g<br>
   data&gt; yellow tangerine and tangy sultana\D<br>
    0: tangerine<br>
    1: tang<br>
    2: tan<br>
    0: tang<br>
    1: tan<br>
    0: tan<br>
 <p>
Since the matching function does not support substring capture, the escape
sequences that are concerned with captured substrings are not relevant.
  
<h2><a name='sect11' href='#toc11'>Restarting After a Partial Match</a></h2>
 <p>
When the alternative matching function
has given the PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL return, indicating that the subject partially
matched the pattern, you can restart the match with additional subject
data by means of the \R escape sequence. For example: <p>
    re&gt; /^d?d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)dd$/<br>
   data&gt; 23ja\P\D<br>
   Partial match: 23ja<br>
   data&gt; n05\R\D<br>
    0: n05<br>
 <p>
For further information about partial matching, see the  <b>pcrepartial</b> 
documentation.   
<h2><a name='sect12' href='#toc12'>Callouts</a></h2>
 <p>
If the pattern contains any callout requests,
<b>pcretest</b>&rsquo;s callout function is called during matching. This works with both
matching functions. By default, the called function displays the callout
number, the start and current positions in the text at the callout time,
and the next pattern item to be tested. For example, the output <p>
  ---&gt;pqrabcdef<br>
     0    ^  ^     \d<br>
 <p>
indicates that callout number 0 occurred for a match attempt starting
at the fourth character of the subject string, when the pointer was at
the seventh character of the data, and when the next pattern item was \d.
Just one circumflex is output if the start and current positions are the
same. <p>
Callouts numbered 255 are assumed to be automatic callouts, inserted
as a result of the <b>/C</b> pattern modifier. In this case, instead of showing
the callout number, the offset in the pattern, preceded by a plus, is output.
For example: <p>
    re&gt; /\d?[A-E]\*/C<br>
   data&gt; E*<br>
   ---&gt;E*<br>
    +0 ^      \d?<br>
    +3 ^      [A-E]<br>
    +8 ^^     \*<br>
   +10 ^ ^<br>
    0: E*<br>
 <p>
The callout function in <b>pcretest</b> returns zero (carry on matching) by default,
but you can use a \C item in a data line (as described above) to change
this. <p>
Inserting callouts can be helpful when using <b>pcretest</b> to check complicated
regular expressions. For further information about callouts, see the  <b>pcrecallout</b>
 documentation.    
<h2><a name='sect13' href='#toc13'>Non-printing Characters</a></h2>
 <p>
When <b>pcretest</b> is outputting text
in the compiled version of a pattern, bytes other than 32-126 are always
treated as non-printing characters are are therefore shown as hex escapes.
<p>
When <b>pcretest</b> is outputting text that is a matched part of a subject string,
it behaves in the same way, unless a different locale has been set for
the pattern (using the <b>/L</b> modifier). In this case, the <b>isprint()</b> function
to distinguish printing and non-printing characters.    
<h2><a name='sect14' href='#toc14'>Saving and Reloading
Compiled Patterns</a></h2>
 <p>
The facilities described in this section are not available
when the POSIX inteface to PCRE is being used, that is, when the <b>/P</b> pattern
modifier is specified. <p>
When the POSIX interface is not in use, you can cause
<b>pcretest</b> to write a compiled pattern to a file, by following the modifiers
with &gt; and a file name. For example: <p>
  /pattern/im &gt;/some/file<br>
 <p>
See the  <b>pcreprecompile</b>  documentation for a discussion about saving and
re-using compiled patterns. <p>
The data that is written is binary. The first
eight bytes are the length of the compiled pattern data followed by the
length of the optional study data, each written as four bytes in big-endian
order (most significant byte first). If there is no study data (either the
pattern was not studied, or studying did not return any data), the second
length is zero. The lengths are followed by an exact copy of the compiled
pattern. If there is additional study data, this follows immediately after
the compiled pattern. After writing the file, <b>pcretest</b> expects to read a
new pattern. <p>
A saved pattern can be reloaded into <b>pcretest</b> by specifing
&lt; and a file name instead of a pattern. The name of the file must not contain
a &lt; character, as otherwise <b>pcretest</b> will interpret the line as a pattern
delimited by &lt; characters. For example: <p>
   re&gt; &lt;/some/file<br>
   Compiled regex loaded from /some/file<br>
   No study data<br>
 <p>
When the pattern has been loaded, <b>pcretest</b> proceeds to read data lines
in the usual way. <p>
You can copy a file written by <b>pcretest</b> to a different
host and reload it there, even if the new host has opposite endianness
to the one on which the pattern was compiled. For example, you can compile
on an i86 machine and run on a SPARC machine. <p>
File names for saving and
reloading can be absolute or relative, but note that the shell facility
of expanding a file name that starts with a tilde (~) is not available.
<p>
The ability to save and reload files in <b>pcretest</b> is intended for testing
and experimentation. It is not intended for production use because only
a single pattern can be written to a file. Furthermore, there is no facility
for supplying custom character tables for use with a reloaded pattern. If
the original pattern was compiled with custom tables, an attempt to match
a subject string using a reloaded pattern is likely to cause <b>pcretest</b> to
crash. Finally, if you attempt to load a file that is not in the correct
format, the result is undefined.
