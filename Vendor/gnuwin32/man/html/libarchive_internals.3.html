<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>OVERVIEW</a></h2>
The  library provides a flexible
interface for reading and writing streaming archive files such as tar and
cpio. Internally, it follows a modular layered design that should make it
easy to add new archive and compression formats. 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>GENERAL ARCHITECTURE</a></h2>
Externally,
libarchive exposes most operations through an opaque, object-style interface.
The  objects store information about a single filesystem object. The rest
of the library provides facilities to write  objects to archive files,
read them from archive files, and write them to disk. (There are plans to
add a facility to read  objects from disk as well.)  The read and write
APIs each have four layers: a public API layer, a format layer that understands
the archive file format, a compression layer, and an I/O layer. The I/O
layer is completely exposed to clients who can replace it entirely with
their own functions.  In order to provide as much consistency as possible
for clients, some public functions are virtualized. Eventually, it should
be possible for clients to open an archive or disk writer, and then use
a single set of code to select and write entries, regardless of the target.

<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>READ ARCHITECTURE</a></h2>
From the outside, clients use the  API to manipulate an
 object to read entries and bodies from an archive stream. Internally, the
 object is cast to an  object, which holds all read-specific data. The API
has four layers: The lowest layer is the I/O layer. This layer can be overridden
by clients, but most clients use the packaged I/O callbacks provided, for
example, by  and  The compression layer calls the I/O layer to read bytes
and decompresses them for the format layer. The format layer unpacks a stream
of uncompressed bytes and creates  objects from the incoming data. The API
layer tracks overall state (for example, it prevents clients from reading
data before reading a header) and invokes the format and compression layer
operations through registered function pointers. In particular, the API
layer drives the format-detection process: When opening the archive, it
reads an initial block of data and offers it to each registered compression
handler. The one with the highest bid is initialized with the first block.
Similarly, the format handlers are polled to see which handler is the best
for each archive. (Prior to 2.4.0, the format bidders were invoked for each
entry, but this design hindered error recovery.)  The read API goes to some
lengths to be nice to clients. As a result, there are few restrictions on
the behavior of the client callbacks.  The client read callback is expected
to provide a block of data on each call. A zero-length return does indicate
end of file, but otherwise blocks may be as small as one byte or as large
as the entire file. In particular, blocks may be of different sizes.  The
client skip callback returns the number of bytes actually skipped, which
may be much smaller than the skip requested. The only requirement is that
the skip not be larger. In particular, clients are allowed to return zero
for any skip that they don&rsquo;t want to handle. The skip callback must never
be invoked with a negative value.  Keep in mind that not all clients are
reading from disk: clients reading from networks may provide different-sized
blocks on every request and cannot skip at all; advanced clients may use
 to read the entire file into memory at once and return the entire file
to libarchive as a single block; other clients may begin asynchronous I/O
operations for the next block on each request.  The decompression layer
not only handles decompression, it also buffers data so that the format
handlers see a much nicer I/O model. The decompression API is a two stage
peek/consume model. A read_ahead request specifies a minimum read amount;
the decompression layer must provide a pointer to at least that much data.
If more data is immediately available, it should return more: the format
layer handles bulk data reads by asking for a minimum of one byte and then
copying as much data as is available.  A subsequent call to the  function
advances the read pointer. Note that data returned from a  call is guaranteed
to remain in place until the next call to  Intervening calls to  should
not cause the data to move.  Skip requests must always be handled exactly.
Decompression handlers that cannot seek forward should not register a skip
handler; the API layer fills in a generic skip handler that reads and discards
data.  A decompression handler has a specific lifecycle:   When the client
invokes the public support function, the decompression handler invokes
the internal  function to provide bid and initialization functions. This
function returns  on error or else a pointer to a  This structure contains
a  slot that can be used for storing any customization information.  The
bid function is invoked with a pointer and size of a block of data. The
decompressor can access its config data through the  element of the  object.
The bid function is otherwise stateless. In particular, it must not perform
any I/O operations.  The value returned by the bid function indicates its
suitability for handling this data stream. A bid of zero will ensure that
this decompressor is never invoked. Return zero if magic number checks fail.
Otherwise, your initial implementation should return the number of bits
actually checked. For example, if you verify two full bytes and three bits
of another byte, bid 19. Note that the initial block may be very short;
be careful to only inspect the data you are given. (The current decompressors
require two bytes for correct bidding.)  The winning bidder will have its
init function called. This function should initialize the remaining slots
of the  object pointed to by the  element of the  object. In particular,
it should allocate any working data it needs in the  slot of that structure.
The init function is called with the block of data that was used for tasting.
At this point, the decompressor is responsible for all I/O requests to
the client callbacks. The decompressor is free to read more data as and
when necessary.  The format handler will invoke the   and  functions as
needed.  The finish method is called only once when the archive is closed.
It should release anything stored in the  and  slots of the  object. It
should not invoke the client close callback.   The read formats have a similar
lifecycle to the decompression handlers:   Allocate your private data and
initialize your pointers.  Formats bid by invoking the  decompression method
but not calling the  method. This allows each bidder to look ahead in the
input stream. Bidders should not look further ahead than necessary, as long
look aheads put pressure on the decompression layer to buffer lots of data.
Most formats only require a few hundred bytes of look ahead; look aheads
of a few kilobytes are reasonable. (The ISO9660 reader sometimes looks ahead
by 48k, which should be considered an upper limit.)  The header read is
usually the most complex part of any format. There are a few strategies
worth mentioning: For formats such as tar or cpio, reading and parsing
the header is straightforward since headers alternate with data. For formats
that store all header data at the beginning of the file, the first header
read request may have to read all headers into memory and store that data,
sorted by the location of the file data. Subsequent header read requests
will skip forward to the beginning of the file data and return the corresponding
header.  The read data interface supports sparse files; this requires that
each call return a block of data specifying the file offset and size. This
may require you to carefully track the location so that you can return
accurate file offsets for each read. Remember that the decompressor will
return as much data as it has. Generally, you will want to request one byte,
examine the return value to see how much data is available, and possibly
trim that to the amount you can use. You should invoke consume for each
block just before you return it.  The skip data call should skip over all
file data and trailing padding. This is called automatically by the API
layer just before each header read. It is also called in response to the
client calling the public  function.  On cleanup, the format should release
all of its allocated memory.   XXX to do XXX

The write
API has a similar set of four layers: an API layer, a format layer, a compression
layer, and an I/O layer. The registration here is much simpler because only
one format and one compression can be registered at a time.  XXX To be written

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>WRITE_DISK ARCHITECTURE</a></h2>
The write_disk API is intended to look just like
the write API to clients. Since it does not handle multiple formats or compression,
it is not layered internally. 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>GENERAL SERVICES</a></h2>
The   and  objects all contain
an initial  object which provides common support for a set of standard
services. (Recall that ANSI/ISO C90 guarantees that you can cast freely
between a pointer to a structure and a pointer to the first element of
that structure.) The  object has a magic value that indicates which API
this object is associated with, slots for storing error information, and
function pointers for virtualized API functions. 
<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>MISCELLANEOUS NOTES</a></h2>
Connecting
existing archiving libraries into libarchive is generally quite difficult.
In particular, many existing libraries strongly assume that you are reading
from a file; they seek forwards and backwards as necessary to locate various
pieces of information. In contrast, libarchive never seeks backwards in
its input, which sometimes requires very different approaches.  For example,
libarchive&rsquo;s ISO9660 support operates very differently from most ISO9660
readers. The libarchive support utilizes a work-queue design that keeps a
list of known entries sorted by their location in the input. Whenever libarchive&rsquo;s
ISO9660 implementation is asked for the next header, checks this list to
find the next item on the disk. Directories are parsed when they are encountered
and new items are added to the list. This design relies heavily on the ISO9660
image being optimized so that directories always occur earlier on the disk
than the files they describe.  Depending on the specific format, such approaches
may not be possible. The ZIP format specification, for example, allows archivers
to store key information only at the end of the file. In theory, it is possible
to create ZIP archives that cannot be read without seeking. Fortunately,
such archives are very rare, and libarchive can read most ZIP archives,
though it cannot always extract as much information as a dedicated ZIP
program.
