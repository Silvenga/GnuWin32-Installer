<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>Pnmgamma</b> performs gamma correction on pseudo-PNM images.

<P>The PPM format specification specifies that certain sample values
in a file represent certain light intensities in an image.  In
particular, they specify that the sample values are directly
proportional to gamma-corrected intensity values.  The gamma
correction they specify is CIE Rec. 709.

<P>However, people sometimes work with approximations of PPM and PGM
where the relationship between the image intensities and the sample
values are something else.  For example, the sample value might be
directly proportional to the intensity with no gamma correction (often
called &quot;linear intensity&quot;).  Or a different gamma transfer
function may be used.

<P><B>pnmgamma</B> allows you to manipulate the transfer function,
thus working with and/or creating pseudo-PPM files that are useful for
various things.

<P>For example, if you feed a true PPM to <B>pnmgamma -cieramp
-ungamma</B>, you get as output a file which is PPM in every respect
except that the sample values are directly proportional to the light
intensities in the image.  If you feed such a file to <B>pnmgamma
-cieramp</B>, you get out a true PPM.

<P>The situation for PGM images is analogous.  And <B>pnmgamma</B>
treats PBM images as PGM images.

<P>When you feed a linear PPM image to a display program that expects
a true PPM, the display appears darker than it should, so
<B>pnmgamma</B> has the effect of lightening the image.  When you feed
a true PPM to a display program that expects linear sample values, and
therefore does a gamma correction of its own on them, the display
appears lighter than it should, so <B>pnmgamma</B> with a gamma value
less than one (the multiplicative inverse of whatever gamma value the
display program uses) has the effect of darkening the image.

<H2>PARAMETERS</H2>

<P>The only parameters are the specification of the input image file
and the gamma values.  Every gamma transfer function <B>pnmgamma</B>
uses contains an exponent, which is the gamma value, and you can
choose that value.

<P>Furthermore, you can choose different values for each of the three
RGB components.  If you specify only one gamma value, <B>pnmgamma</B>
uses that value for all three RGB components.

<P>If you don't specify any gamma parameters, <B>pnmgamma</B> chooses
a default.  For the transfer functions defined by standards, the
default is the value defined by the standard.  If you specify anything
else, you will be varying from the standard.  For the simple power
function transfer function, the default gamma is 1/.45.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-ungamma</B>

<DD>Apply the inverse of the specified transfer function (i.e. go from
gamma-corrected nonlinear intensities to linear intensities).

<DT><B>-cieramp</B>

<DD>Use the CIE Rec. 709 gamma transfer function.  Note that it is
true CIE Rec. 709 only if you use the default gamma value (i.e. don't
specify any gamma parameters).  This transfer function is a power
function modified with a linear ramp near black.

<P>If you specify neither <B>-cieramp</B> nor <B>-srgbramp</B>, the
transfer function defaults to a simple power function.

<DT><B>-srgbramp </B>

<DD>Use the Internation Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) SRGB gamma
transfer function (as specified in the standard IEC 61966-2-1).  Note
that it is true SRGB only if you use the default gamma value
(i.e. don't specify any gamma parameters).  This transfer function is
like the one selected by <B>-cieramp</B>, but with different constants
in it.

<P>Note that SRGB is often spelled &quot;sRGB&quot;.  In this
document, we use standard English typography, though, which doesn't
allow for that kind of capitalization.

<P>If you specify neither <B>-cieramp</B> nor <B>-srgbramp</B>, the
transfer function defaults to a simple power function.

<H2>WHAT IS GAMMA?</H2>

<P>A good explanation of gamma is in Charles Poynton's Gamma FAQ at
<A HREF="http://www.poynton.com/GammaFAQ.html">
http://www.poynton.com/GammaFAQ.html</A> and Color FAQ at <A
HREF="http://www.poynton.com/ColorFAQ.html">
http://www.poynton.com/ColorFAQ.html</A>.

<P>In brief: The simplest way to code an image is by using sample
values that are directly proportional to the intensity of the color
components.  But that wastes the sample space because the human eye
can't discern differences between low-intensity colors as well as it
can between high-intensity colors.  So instead, we pass the light
intensity values through a transfer function that makes it so that
changing a sample value by 1 causes the same level of perceived color
change anywhere in the sample range.  We store those resulting values
in the image file.  That transfer function is called the gamma
transfer function and the transformation is called gamma correcting.

<P>Virtually all image formats, either specified or de facto, use
gamma-corrected values for their sample values.

<P>What's really nice about gamma is that by coincidence, the inverse
function that you have to do to convert the gamma-corrected values
back to real light intensities is done automatically by CRTs.  You
just apply a voltage to the CRT's electron gun that is proportional to
the gamma-corrected sample value, and the intensity of light that
comes out of the screen is close to the intensity value you had before
you applied the gamma transfer function!

<P>And when you consider that computer video devices usually want you
to store in video memory a value proportional to the signal voltage
you want to go to the monitor, which the monitor turns into a
proportional drive voltage on the electron gun, it is really
convenient to work with gamma-corrected sample values.
