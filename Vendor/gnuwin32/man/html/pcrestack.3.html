<p>
When you call <b>pcre_exec()</b>, it makes use of an internal function called
<b>match()</b>. This calls itself recursively at branch points in the pattern,
in order to remember the state of the match so that it can back up and
try a different alternative if the first one fails. As matching proceeds
deeper and deeper into the tree of possibilities, the recursion depth increases.
<p>
Not all calls of <b>match()</b> increase the recursion depth; for an item such
as a* it may be called several times at the same level, after matching
different numbers of a&rsquo;s. Furthermore, in a number of cases where the result
of the recursive call would immediately be passed back as the result of
the current call (a "tail recursion"), the function is just restarted instead.
<p>
The <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b> function operates in an entirely different way, and
hardly uses recursion at all. The limit on its complexity is the amount
of workspace it is given. The comments that follow do NOT apply to <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>;
they are relevant only for <b>pcre_exec()</b>. <p>
You can set limits on the number
of times that <b>match()</b> is called, both in total and recursively. If the limit
is exceeded, an error occurs. For details, see the   section on extra data
for <b>pcre_exec()</b>  in the  <b>pcreapi</b>  documentation. <p>
Each time that <b>match()</b>
is actually called recursively, it uses memory from the process stack. For
certain kinds of pattern and data, very large amounts of stack may be needed,
despite the recognition of "tail recursion". You can often reduce the amount
of recursion, and therefore the amount of stack used, by modifying the
pattern that is being matched. Consider, for example, this pattern: <p>
  ([^&lt;]|&lt;(?!inet))+<br>
 <p>
It matches from wherever it starts until it encounters "&lt;inet" or the end
of the data, and is the kind of pattern that might be used when processing
an XML file. Each iteration of the outer parentheses matches either one
character that is not "&lt;" or a "&lt;" that is not followed by "inet". However,
each time a parenthesis is processed, a recursion occurs, so this formulation
uses a stack frame for each matched character. For a long string, a lot
of stack is required. Consider now this rewritten pattern, which matches
exactly the same strings: <p>
  ([^&lt;]++|&lt;(?!inet))<br>
 <p>
This uses very much less stack, because runs of characters that do not
contain "&lt;" are "swallowed" in one item inside the parentheses. Recursion
happens only when a "&lt;" character that is not followed by "inet" is encountered
(and we assume this is relatively rare). A possessive quantifier is used
to stop any backtracking into the runs of non-"&lt;" characters, but that is
not related to stack usage. <p>
This example shows that one way of avoiding
stack problems when matching long subject strings is to write repeated
parenthesized subpatterns to match more than one character whenever possible.
<p>
In environments where stack memory is constrained, you might want to compile
PCRE to use heap memory instead of stack for remembering back-up points.
This makes it run a lot more slowly, however. Details of how to do this
are given in the  <b>pcrebuild</b>  documentation. <p>
In Unix-like environments, there
is not often a problem with the stack unless very long strings are involved,
though the default limit on stack size varies from system to system. Values
from 8Mb to 64Mb are common. You can find your default limit by running
the command: <p>
  ulimit -s<br>
 <p>
Unfortunately, the effect of running out of stack is often SIGSEGV, though
sometimes a more explicit error message is given. You can normally increase
the limit on stack size by code such as this: <p>
  struct rlimit rlim;<br>
   getrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;rlim);<br>
   rlim.rlim_cur = 100*1024*1024;<br>
   setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;rlim);<br>
 <p>
This reads the current limits (soft and hard) using <b>getrlimit()</b>, then
attempts to increase the soft limit to 100Mb using <b>setrlimit()</b>. You must
do this before calling <b>pcre_exec()</b>. <p>
PCRE has an internal counter that can
be used to limit the depth of recursion, and thus cause <b>pcre_exec()</b> to
give an error code before it runs out of stack. By default, the limit is
very large, and unlikely ever to operate. It can be changed when PCRE is
built, and it can also be set when <b>pcre_exec()</b> is called. For details of
these interfaces, see the  <b>pcrebuild</b>  and  <b>pcreapi</b>  documentation. <p>
As a
very rough rule of thumb, you should reckon on about 500 bytes per recursion.
Thus, if you want to limit your stack usage to 8Mb, you should set the
limit at 16000 recursions. A 64Mb stack, on the other hand, can support
around 128000 recursions. The <b>pcretest</b> test program has a command line option
(<b>-S</b>) that can be used to increase the size of its stack. <p>
