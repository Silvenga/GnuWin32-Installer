<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Pcre Build-time Options</a></h2>
 <p>
This
document describes the optional features of PCRE that can be selected when
the library is compiled. They are all selected, or deselected, by providing
options to the <b>configure</b> script that is run before the <b>make</b> command. The
complete list of options for <b>configure</b> (which includes the standard ones
such as the selection of the installation directory) can be obtained by
running <p>
  ./configure --help<br>
 <p>
The following sections describe certain options whose names begin with
--enable or --disable. These settings specify changes to the defaults for the
<b>configure</b> command. Because of the way that <b>configure</b> works, --enable and --disable
always come in pairs, so the complementary option always exists as well,
but as it specifies the default, it is not described.  
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>C++ Support</a></h2>
 <p>
By default,
the <b>configure</b> script will search for a C++ compiler and C++ header files.
If it finds them, it automatically builds the C++ wrapper library for PCRE.
You can disable this by adding <p>
  --disable-cpp<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command.  
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Utf-8 Support</a></h2>
 <p>
To build PCRE with support for
UTF-8 character strings, add <p>
  --enable-utf8<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command. Of itself, this does not make PCRE treat strings
as UTF-8. As well as compiling PCRE with this option, you also have have
to set the PCRE_UTF8 option when you call the <b>pcre_compile()</b> function. 

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Unicode Character Property Support</a></h2>
 <p>
UTF-8 support allows PCRE to process
character values greater than 255 in the strings that it handles. On its
own, however, it does not provide any facilities for accessing the properties
of such characters. If you want to be able to use the pattern escapes \P,
\p, and \X, which refer to Unicode character properties, you must add <p>
  --enable-unicode-properties<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command. This implies UTF-8 support, even if you have not
explicitly requested it. <p>
Including Unicode property support adds around
90K of tables to the PCRE library, approximately doubling its size. Only
the general category properties such as <i>Lu</i> and <i>Nd</i> are supported. Details
are given in the  <b>pcrepattern</b>  documentation.  
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Code Value of Newline</a></h2>
 <p>
By
default, PCRE interprets character 10 (linefeed, LF) as indicating the
end of a line. This is the normal newline character on Unix-like systems.
You can compile PCRE to use character 13 (carriage return, CR) instead,
by adding <p>
  --enable-newline-is-cr<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command. There is also a --enable-newline-is-lf option, which
explicitly specifies linefeed as the newline character. <p>
Alternatively, you
can specify that line endings are to be indicated by the two character
sequence CRLF. If you want this, add <p>
  --enable-newline-is-crlf<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command. There is a fourth option, specified by <p>
  --enable-newline-is-any<br>
 <p>
which causes PCRE to recognize any Unicode newline sequence. <p>
Whatever line
ending convention is selected when PCRE is built can be overridden when
the library functions are called. At build time it is conventional to use
the standard for your operating system.  
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Building Shared and Static Libraries</a></h2>

<p>
The PCRE building process uses <b>libtool</b> to build both shared and static
Unix libraries by default. You can suppress one of these by adding one of
<p>
  --disable-shared<br>
   --disable-static<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command, as required.  
<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Posix Malloc Usage</a></h2>
 <p>
When PCRE is
called through the POSIX interface (see the  <b>pcreposix</b>  documentation),
additional working storage is required for holding the pointers to capturing
substrings, because PCRE requires three integers per substring, whereas
the POSIX interface provides only two. If the number of expected substrings
is small, the wrapper function uses space on the stack, because this is
faster than using <b>malloc()</b> for each call. The default threshold above which
the stack is no longer used is 10; it can be changed by adding a setting
such as <p>
  --with-posix-malloc-threshold=20<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command.  
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Handling Very Large Patterns</a></h2>
 <p>
Within a compiled
pattern, offset values are used to point from one part to another (for
example, from an opening parenthesis to an alternation metacharacter). By
default, two-byte values are used for these offsets, leading to a maximum
size for a compiled pattern of around 64K. This is sufficient to handle
all but the most gigantic patterns. Nevertheless, some people do want to
process enormous patterns, so it is possible to compile PCRE to use three-byte
or four-byte offsets by adding a setting such as <p>
  --with-link-size=3<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command. The value given must be 2, 3, or 4. Using longer
offsets slows down the operation of PCRE because it has to load additional
bytes when handling them. <p>
If you build PCRE with an increased link size,
test 2 (and test 5 if you are using UTF-8) will fail. Part of the output
of these tests is a representation of the compiled pattern, and this changes
with the link size.  
<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Avoiding Excessive Stack Usage</a></h2>
 <p>
When matching with the
<b>pcre_exec()</b> function, PCRE implements backtracking by making recursive
calls to an internal function called <b>match()</b>. In environments where the
size of the stack is limited, this can severely limit PCRE&rsquo;s operation. (The
Unix environment does not usually suffer from this problem, but it may
sometimes be necessary to increase the maximum stack size. There is a discussion
in the  <b>pcrestack</b>  documentation.) An alternative approach to recursion
that uses memory from the heap to remember data, instead of using recursive
function calls, has been implemented to work round the problem of limited
stack size. If you want to build a version of PCRE that works this way,
add <p>
  --disable-stack-for-recursion<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command. With this configuration, PCRE will use the <b>pcre_stack_malloc</b>
and <b>pcre_stack_free</b> variables to call memory management functions. Separate
functions are provided because the usage is very predictable: the block
sizes requested are always the same, and the blocks are always freed in
reverse order. A calling program might be able to implement optimized functions
that perform better than the standard <b>malloc()</b> and <b>free()</b> functions. PCRE
runs noticeably more slowly when built in this way. This option affects
only the <b>pcre_exec()</b> function; it is not relevant for the the <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>
function.  
<h2><a name='sect10' href='#toc10'>Limiting Pcre Resource Usage</a></h2>
 <p>
Internally, PCRE has a function
called <b>match()</b>, which it calls repeatedly (sometimes recursively) when
matching a pattern with the <b>pcre_exec()</b> function. By controlling the maximum
number of times this function may be called during a single matching operation,
a limit can be placed on the resources used by a single call to <b>pcre_exec()</b>.
The limit can be changed at run time, as described in the  <b>pcreapi</b>  documentation.
The default is 10 million, but this can be changed by adding a setting
such as <p>
  --with-match-limit=500000<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command. This setting has no effect on the <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>
matching function. <p>
In some environments it is desirable to limit the depth
of recursive calls of <b>match()</b> more strictly than the total number of calls,
in order to restrict the maximum amount of stack (or heap, if --disable-stack-for-recursion
is specified) that is used. A second limit controls this; it defaults to
the value that is set for --with-match-limit, which imposes no additional constraints.
However, you can set a lower limit by adding, for example, <p>
  --with-match-limit-recursion=10000<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command. This value can also be overridden at run time.
 
<h2><a name='sect11' href='#toc11'>Using Ebcdic Code</a></h2>
 <p>
PCRE assumes by default that it will run in an environment
where the character code is ASCII (or Unicode, which is a superset of ASCII).
PCRE can, however, be compiled to run in an EBCDIC environment by adding
<p>
  --enable-ebcdic<br>
 <p>
to the <b>configure</b> command.
