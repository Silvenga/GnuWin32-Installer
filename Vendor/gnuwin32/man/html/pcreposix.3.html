<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
 <p>
This set of functions provides
a POSIX-style API to the PCRE regular expression package. See the  <b>pcreapi</b>
 documentation for a description of PCRE&rsquo;s native API, which contains much
additional functionality. <p>
The functions described here are just wrapper
functions that ultimately call the PCRE native API. Their prototypes are
defined in the <b>pcreposix.h</b> header file, and on Unix systems the library
itself is called <b>pcreposix.a</b>, so can be accessed by adding <b>-lpcreposix</b> to
the command for linking an application that uses them. Because the POSIX
functions call the native ones, it is also necessary to add <b>-lpcre</b>. <p>
I have
implemented only those option bits that can be reasonably mapped to PCRE
native options. In addition, the option REG_EXTENDED is defined with the
value zero. This has no effect, but since programs that are written to the
POSIX interface often use it, this makes it easier to slot in PCRE as a
replacement library. Other POSIX options are not even defined. <p>
When PCRE
is called via these functions, it is only the API that is POSIX-like in
style. The syntax and semantics of the regular expressions themselves are
still those of Perl, subject to the setting of various PCRE options, as
described below. "POSIX-like in style" means that the API approximates to
the POSIX definition; it is not fully POSIX-compatible, and in multi-byte
encoding domains it is probably even less compatible. <p>
The header for these
functions is supplied as <b>pcreposix.h</b> to avoid any potential clash with other
POSIX libraries. It can, of course, be renamed or aliased as <b>regex.h</b>, which
is the "correct" name. It provides two structure types, <i>regex_t</i> for compiled
internal forms, and <i>regmatch_t</i> for returning captured substrings. It also
defines some constants whose names start with "REG_"; these are used for
setting options and identifying error codes. <p>

<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Compiling a Pattern</a></h2>
 <p>
The function
<b>regcomp()</b> is called to compile a pattern into an internal form. The pattern
is a C string terminated by a binary zero, and is passed in the argument
<i>pattern</i>. The <i>preg</i> argument is a pointer to a <b>regex_t</b> structure that is used
as a base for storing information about the compiled regular expression.
<p>
The argument <i>cflags</i> is either zero, or contains one or more of the bits
defined by the following macros: <p>
  REG_DOTALL<br>
 <p>
The PCRE_DOTALL option is set when the regular expression is passed for
compilation to the native function. Note that REG_DOTALL is not part of
the POSIX standard. <p>
  REG_ICASE<br>
 <p>
The PCRE_CASELESS option is set when the regular expression is passed
for compilation to the native function. <p>
  REG_NEWLINE<br>
 <p>
The PCRE_MULTILINE option is set when the regular expression is passed
for compilation to the native function. Note that this does <i>not</i> mimic the
defined POSIX behaviour for REG_NEWLINE (see the following section). <p>
  REG_NOSUB<br>
 <p>
The PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE option is set when the regular expression is
passed for compilation to the native function. In addition, when a pattern
that is compiled with this flag is passed to <b>regexec()</b> for matching, the
<i>nmatch</i> and <i>pmatch</i> arguments are ignored, and no captured strings are returned.
<p>
  REG_UTF8<br>
 <p>
The PCRE_UTF8 option is set when the regular expression is passed for
compilation to the native function. This causes the pattern itself and all
data strings used for matching it to be treated as UTF-8 strings. Note that
REG_UTF8 is not part of the POSIX standard. <p>
In the absence of these flags,
no options are passed to the native function. This means the the regex is
compiled with PCRE default semantics. In particular, the way it handles
newline characters in the subject string is the Perl way, not the POSIX
way. Note that setting PCRE_MULTILINE has only <i>some</i> of the effects specified
for REG_NEWLINE. It does not affect the way newlines are matched by . (they
aren&rsquo;t) or by a negative class such as [^a] (they are). <p>
The yield of <b>regcomp()</b>
is zero on success, and non-zero otherwise. The <i>preg</i> structure is filled
in on success, and one member of the structure is public: <i>re_nsub</i> contains
the number of capturing subpatterns in the regular expression. Various error
codes are defined in the header file.   
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Matching Newline Characters</a></h2>
 <p>
This
area is not simple, because POSIX and Perl take different views of things.
It is not possible to get PCRE to obey POSIX semantics, but then PCRE was
never intended to be a POSIX engine. The following table lists the different
possibilities for matching newline characters in PCRE: <p>
               
          Default   Change with<br>
 <p>
  . matches newline          no     PCRE_DOTALL<br>
   newline matches [^a]       yes    not changeable<br>
   $ matches \n at end        yes    PCRE_DOLLARENDONLY<br>
   $ matches \n in middle     no     PCRE_MULTILINE<br>
   ^ matches \n in middle     no     PCRE_MULTILINE<br>
 <p>
This is the equivalent table for POSIX: <p>
                          Default
  Change with<br>
 <p>
  . matches newline          yes    REG_NEWLINE<br>
   newline matches [^a]       yes    REG_NEWLINE<br>
   $ matches \n at end        no     REG_NEWLINE<br>
   $ matches \n in middle     no     REG_NEWLINE<br>
   ^ matches \n in middle     no     REG_NEWLINE<br>
 <p>
PCRE&rsquo;s behaviour is the same as Perl&rsquo;s, except that there is no equivalent
for PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY in Perl. In both PCRE and Perl, there is no way
to stop newline from matching [^a]. <p>
The default POSIX newline handling can
be obtained by setting PCRE_DOTALL and PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY, but there is
no way to make PCRE behave exactly as for the REG_NEWLINE action.   
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Matching
a Pattern</a></h2>
 <p>
The function <b>regexec()</b> is called to match a compiled pattern
<i>preg</i> against a given <i>string</i>, which is terminated by a zero byte, subject
to the options in <i>eflags</i>. These can be: <p>
  REG_NOTBOL<br>
 <p>
The PCRE_NOTBOL option is set when calling the underlying PCRE matching
function. <p>
  REG_NOTEOL<br>
 <p>
The PCRE_NOTEOL option is set when calling the underlying PCRE matching
function. <p>
If the pattern was compiled with the REG_NOSUB flag, no data about
any matched strings is returned. The <i>nmatch</i> and <i>pmatch</i> arguments of <b>regexec()</b>
are ignored. <p>
Otherwise,the portion of the string that was matched, and also
any captured substrings, are returned via the <i>pmatch</i> argument, which points
to an array of <i>nmatch</i> structures of type <i>regmatch_t</i>, containing the members
<i>rm_so</i> and <i>rm_eo</i>. These contain the offset to the first character of each
substring and the offset to the first character after the end of each substring,
respectively. The 0th element of the vector relates to the entire portion
of <i>string</i> that was matched; subsequent elements relate to the capturing
subpatterns of the regular expression. Unused entries in the array have
both structure members set to -1. <p>
A successful match yields a zero return;
various error codes are defined in the header file, of which REG_NOMATCH
is the "expected" failure code.   
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Error Messages</a></h2>
 <p>
The <b>regerror()</b> function
maps a non-zero errorcode from either <b>regcomp()</b> or <b>regexec()</b> to a printable
message. If <i>preg</i> is not NULL, the error should have arisen from the use
of that structure. A message terminated by a binary zero is placed in <i>errbuf</i>.
The length of the message, including the zero, is limited to <i>errbuf_size</i>.
The yield of the function is the size of buffer needed to hold the whole
message.   
<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Memory Usage</a></h2>
 <p>
Compiling a regular expression causes memory to
be allocated and associated with the <i>preg</i> structure. The function <b>regfree()</b>
frees all such memory, after which <i>preg</i> may no longer be used as a compiled
expression.
