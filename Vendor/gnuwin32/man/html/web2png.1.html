<p> <p>
Web2png is a front end for <a href='gif2png.1.html'>gif2png(1)</a>
 that automatically converts
entire web page hierarchies from using GIFs to using PNGs. It does image
conversion and patches IMG SRC references in web pages. 
<p> <p>
The arguments to
<b>web2png</b> must be directories; if none are given, the current directory is
assumed. 
<p> <p>
In each directory, <b>web2png</b> tries to convert every GIF to a PNG.
It leaves alone GIFs that have either multiple images or transparency,
because these will not display properly in all current browsers. It also
does not reconvert GIFs that already have corresponding PNGs (e.g. the same
name except for the .gif file extension). The original GIFs are left in place.

<p> <p>
Web2png tracks successful conversions. It then looks at each HTML, secure
HTML, HTML inclusion, PHP page, JavaScript program or Cascading Style Sheet
under the argument directories (extensions html, shtml, .inc, .php, .js, .css).
In these pages, it fixes each reference to each successful converted GIF
to point at the PNG. References in relative HREF and BACKGROUND tags are
recognized by filename and fixed (any base directory declared by a BASE
tag will be be prepended to the relative URL). References that are HTTP
URLs are matched against the list of convertible GIFs by basename; if there
is such a match, the contents of the URL is retrieved and compared to the
convertible GIF. If both basename and data match, the HTTP reference is
fixed. If the pages are under RCS version control, they&rsquo;re checked out for
modification before being altered; otherwise, a copy of the original of
each modified web page is left in the same directory, with the additional
extension .bak. 
<p> <p>
The following options change the behavior of the program:

<p> <br>
<pre>











Convert all GIF files, including those with multiple images and/or transparency.Delete
originals. Removes all GIFs with corresponding PNGs, and all .bak files.Make
no changes. With this option, web2png reports on what needs to be done (and
on GIFs that use transparency or have multiple images), but neither converts
GIFs nor touches web pages.Reverse. Restore all HTML/SHTML/PHP pages from
the .bak files created by a previous run (or, if the files were under version
control, revert them). Remove PNGs with corresponding GIFs.Convert transparent
GIFs (for use with IE 5.0+. Netscape 6.0+, and Mozilla).Verbose. Utter more
trace information about the conversion process. Web2png can be run on a
directory that has already been partly converted by previous runs; it will
do the minimum necessary amount of work. The changes it makes will be fully
reversible with -r until you run it in -d mode. Web2png is written in Python.
Python 1.5.2 or better must be installed and accessible on your system in
order for web2png to run.Note Sometimes it&rsquo;s possible to convert transparent
GIFs without altering the appearance of the page, by knowing from context
that they will always place within an area of fixed and solid color. Web2png
can&rsquo;t deduce when this will be, so it doesn&rsquo;t try; but it may be useful to
apply gif2png with the -b option by hand.  
Known Problems The algorithm for
fixing HTTP URLs is not foolproof. It could be confused into incorrectly
patching an HTTP URL reference to a GIF into an invalid reference to a
PNG if the GIF matches a local target GIF by both basename and binary content,
but actually lives on another host.  
This program does not automatically
convert CGIs; you&rsquo;ll have to do that by hand. Other dynamic-content methods
(such as server-side inclusions) may also require hand-hacking.  
The program
cannot tell converted from preexisting PNGs; if you have PNGs with the
same stem name as corresponding GIFs but carrying different information,
the -r mode will clobber them.
