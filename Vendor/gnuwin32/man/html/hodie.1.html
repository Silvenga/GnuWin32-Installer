<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>

<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>hodie </b>[ <i>OPTION</i>
]... 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<b>hodie</b> prints out the current date using classic Latin, and
in addition also prints it out and time using Roman numerals. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt>-h,
--help</dt>
<dd>Print short help message with syntax </dd>

<dt>-v, --verbose</dt>
<dd>Print months and days
(pridie, Kalends, Nones, Ides) full and not the respective abbreviations
(standard mode of operation) 
<p> <i>Two occurrences of </i>-v<i> as well as the use of
</i>-vv<i></i> <i> or </i>--extremely-verbose  will include the numerals where applicable fully
declined, as in &rsquo;ante diem <b>quintum</b> Kalends Septembres&rsquo;. </dd>

<dt>-n, --numerals</dt>
<dd>Don&rsquo;t print
anything in Latin - only the date and time as Roman numerals. </dd>

<dt>-x, --force-numerals</dt>
<dd>Print
both the verbose latin and the date and time as Roman numerals. </dd>

<dt>-c, --classic,
--auc</dt>
<dd>Print the year in the classic manner <i>ab urbe condita</i> instead of the
more modern <i>anno domini</i>. </dd>

<dt>-ad, --ante-diem</dt>
<dd>Print the date expressing the number
of days to the next main day with the <i>ante diem</i> expression instead of ablative
case. </dd>

<dt>-d, --date</dt>
<dd>Print out any date. This has a rather special syntax, with a
keyword following the  <i>-d</i> flag choosing input format. See section on  <i>DATE</i>
INPUT below. </dd>

<dt>-r, --republican OFFSET</dt>
<dd>Print out the date dated  <i>ab</i> urbe tua condita
with the offset counted in years as compared to the modern european kalendar

equivalent with <b>hodie </b><i>-c</i>  </dd>

<dt>--version</dt>
<dd>Print out the version number of this release
and exit. No matter whether other options appear on the command line or
not. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Date Input</a></h2>
Following the  <i>-d</i> or the <i>--date</i> option flags, the first item
 <b>must</b> be one of the following: 
<dl>

<dt>verbose</dt>
<dd>In this case, the year, month and
day are given by following the <i>verbose</i> keyword by the flags  <i>-y,</i> --year, -m,
--month, -d, --day for year, month and date respectively </dd>

<dt>ymd</dt>
<dd>After this flag,
the date comes in the format <i>YYYY-MM-DD</i> , where the numbers may  be separated
by any non-numeric character. </dd>

<dt>dmy</dt>
<dd>With this flag, the date is given as <i>DD-MM-YYYY</i>
</dd>

<dt>mdy</dt>
<dd>With this flag, the date is given as <i>MM-DD-YYYY</i>  Restrictions on the characters
that may replace the hyphen apply as above. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>History</a></h2>
The story began on the
10. of August, 2000 (a.d. VI Id. Iul., MM). Having finished most of my assignment
for my two-month summer job at Ericsson Eurolab Deutschland, Nuremberg,
I was idling around on the Internet, and stumbled over the dotcomma-challenges
<i>&lt;<a href='http://www.dotcomma.org'>http://www.dotcomma.org</a>
&gt;</i> , where especially the Roman numeral challenge started
my mind. 
<p> Almost an hour hacking, and there it was, another hour, and the
<i>language support</i> was there. Before the night was over, I had written this
man page and had the layout of a decent  <b>Makefile</b> drawn out mentally. 
<p> At
the end of the next day, I was so far that I actually had the workings
of  <i>RPM</i> worked out, constructed a .rpm-package and a .src.rpm-package, which
was promptly released on my home-page, announced on freshmeat and uploaded
to metalab (apps/misc :-). 
<p> Response was quick and plentiful. By now, I have
compilation reports from Linux, FreeBSD and SCO Unixware 7; there are a
few compability issues to put aside, but it works surprisingly well. 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Return
Values</a></h2>
<b>hodie</b> returns zero. Always. If it doesn&rsquo;t, then something is <b>really</b>
bad with the code. 
<p> For some really unreadable code, this means that <b>hodie</b>
could be used as a strange replacement for <b>true</b>  
<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Bugs</a></h2>
It doesn&rsquo;t sanity check
the input... telling <b>hodie</b> to display the roman form of the 99th of march
gives a slightly jumbled output, which most definitely does not make sense.

<p> Reports are more than welcome (e-mail below). 
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Author</a></h2>
Now, who would come
up with such a thing? Well, I&rsquo;m Mikael Johansson, a rather all-round geek
from Stockholm. I&rsquo;m gravely interested in languages, in computers and in
mathematics; a combination more dangerous than you might think. 
<p> E-mails
to <i>&lt;mikael.johansson@wineasy.se&gt;</i> 
<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Todo</a></h2>
A double and triple grammar check (will
be done as soon as I start my university studies). 
<p> Check that it really
does display correctly for all dates. 
<p> Implement a complementary, ancient
Greek program :-) 
<p> Perhaps port/translate top, uptime, and other nice utilities
to Latin :-) 
<p> And, as always... Debugging debugging debugging!
