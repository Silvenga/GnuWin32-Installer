<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
unzip - list, test and extract compressed files in a ZIP
archive  
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>unzip</b> [<b>-Z</b>] [<b>-cflptuvz</b>[<b>abjnoqsCLMVX$/:</b>]] <i>file</i>[<i>.zip</i>] [<i>file(s)</i>&nbsp;...]
[<b>-x</b>&nbsp;<i>xfile(s)</i>&nbsp;...] [<b>-d</b>&nbsp;<i>exdir</i>]   
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<i>unzip</i> will list, test, or extract files
from a ZIP archive, commonly found on MS-DOS systems.  The default behavior
(with no options) is to extract into the current directory (and subdirectories
below it) all files from the specified ZIP archive.  A companion program,
<a href='zip.1L.html'><i>zip</i>(1L)</a>
, creates ZIP archives; both programs are compatible with archives
created by PKWARE&rsquo;s <i>PKZIP</i> and <i>PKUNZIP</i> for MS-DOS, but in many cases the program
options or default behaviors differ.   
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Arguments</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><i>file</i>[<i>.zip</i>] </dt>
<dd>Path of the ZIP
archive(s).  If the file specification is a wildcard, each matching file
is processed in an order determined by the operating system (or file system).
 Only the filename can be a wildcard; the path itself cannot.  Wildcard
expressions are similar to those supported in commonly used Unix shells
(<i>sh</i>, <i>ksh</i>, <i>csh</i>) and may contain: <blockquote></dd>

<dt>*</dt>
<dd>matches a sequence of 0 or more characters
</dd>

<dt>?</dt>
<dd>matches exactly 1 character </dd>

<dt>[...]</dt>
<dd>matches any single character found inside
the brackets; ranges are specified by a beginning character, a hyphen,
and an ending character.  If an exclamation point or a caret (&lsquo;!&rsquo; or &lsquo;^&rsquo;) follows
the left bracket, then the range of characters within the brackets is complemented
(that is, anything <i>except</i> the characters inside the brackets is considered
a match). </dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<dl>

<dt>(Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted
or </dt>
<dd>modified by the operating system, particularly under Unix and VMS.) 
If no matches are found, the specification is assumed to be a literal filename;
and if that also fails, the suffix .zip is appended.  Note that self-extracting
ZIP files are supported, as with any other ZIP archive; just specify the
.exe suffix (if any) explicitly. </dd>

<dt>[<i>file(s)</i>]</dt>
<dd>An optional list of archive members
to be processed, separated by spaces. (VMS versions compiled with VMSCLI
defined must delimit files with commas instead.  See <b>-v</b> in <b>OPTIONS</b> below.)
Regular expressions (wildcards) may be used to match multiple members;
see above.  Again, be sure to quote expressions that would otherwise be
expanded or modified by the operating system. </dd>

<dt>[<b>-x</b>&nbsp;<i>xfile(s)</i>]</dt>
<dd>An optional list
of archive members to be excluded from processing. Since wildcard characters
match directory separators (&lsquo;/&rsquo;), this option may be used to exclude any
files that are in subdirectories.  For example, &lsquo;&lsquo;unzip foo *.[ch] -x */*&rsquo;&rsquo; would
extract all C source files in the main directory, but none in any subdirectories.
 Without the <b>-x</b> option, all C source files in all directories within the
zipfile would be extracted. </dd>

<dt>[<b>-d</b>&nbsp;<i>exdir</i>]</dt>
<dd>An optional directory to which to extract
files.  By default, all files and subdirectories are recreated in the current
directory; the <b>-d</b> option allows extraction in an arbitrary directory (always
assuming one has permission to write to the directory).  This option need
not appear at the end of the command line; it is also accepted before the
zipfile specification (with the normal options), immediately after the
zipfile specification, or between the <i>file(s)</i> and the <b>-x</b> option. The option
and directory may be concatenated without any white space between them,
but note that this may cause normal shell behavior to be suppressed.  In
particular, &lsquo;&lsquo;-d&nbsp;~&rsquo;&rsquo; (tilde) is expanded by Unix C shells into the name of the
user&rsquo;s home directory, but &lsquo;&lsquo;-d~&rsquo;&rsquo; is treated as a literal subdirectory &lsquo;&lsquo;<b>~</b>&rsquo;&rsquo; of
the current directory.  </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Options</a></h2>
Note that, in order to support obsolescent
hardware, <i>unzip</i>&rsquo;s usage screen is limited to 22 or 23 lines and should therefore
be considered only a reminder of the basic <i>unzip</i> syntax rather than an
exhaustive list of all possible flags.  The exhaustive list follows: 
<dl>

<dt><b>-Z</b> </dt>
<dd><a href='zipinfo.1L.html'><i>zipinfo</i>(1L)</a>

mode.  If the first option on the command line is <b>-Z</b>, the remaining options
are taken to be <a href='zipinfo.1L.html'><i>zipinfo</i>(1L)</a>
 options.  See the appropriate manual page for
a description of these options. </dd>

<dt><b>-A</b> </dt>
<dd>[OS/2, Unix DLL] print extended help for
the DLL&rsquo;s programming interface (API). </dd>

<dt><b>-c</b> </dt>
<dd>extract files to stdout/screen (&lsquo;&lsquo;CRT&rsquo;&rsquo;).
 This option is similar to the <b>-p</b> option except that the name of each file
is printed as it is extracted, the <b>-a</b> option is allowed, and ASCII-EBCDIC
conversion is automatically performed if appropriate.  This option is not
listed in the <i>unzip</i> usage screen. </dd>

<dt><b>-f</b> </dt>
<dd>freshen existing files, i.e., extract
only those files that already exist on disk and that are newer than the
disk copies.  By default <i>unzip</i> queries before overwriting, but the <b>-o</b> option
may be used to suppress the queries.  Note that under many operating systems,
the TZ (timezone) environment variable must be set correctly in order for
<b>-f</b> and <b>-u</b> to work properly (under Unix the variable is usually set automatically).
 The reasons for this are somewhat subtle but have to do with the differences
between DOS-format file times (always local time) and Unix-format times (always
in GMT/UTC) and the necessity to compare the two.  A typical TZ value is
&lsquo;&lsquo;PST8PDT&rsquo;&rsquo; (US Pacific time with automatic adjustment for Daylight Savings
Time or &lsquo;&lsquo;summer time&rsquo;&rsquo;). </dd>

<dt><b>-l</b> </dt>
<dd>list archive files (short format).  The names, uncompressed
file sizes and modification dates and times of the specified files are
printed, along with totals for all files specified.  If UnZip was compiled
with OS2_EAS defined, the <b>-l</b> option also lists columns for the sizes of
stored OS/2 extended attributes (EAs) and OS/2 access control lists (ACLs).
 In addition, the zipfile comment and individual file comments (if any)
are displayed.  If a file was archived from a single-case file system (for
example, the old MS-DOS FAT file system) and the <b>-L</b> option was given, the
filename is converted to lowercase and is prefixed with a caret (^). </dd>

<dt><b>-p</b> </dt>
<dd>extract
files to pipe (stdout).  Nothing but the file data is sent to stdout, and
the files are always extracted in binary format, just as they are stored
(no conversions). </dd>

<dt><b>-t</b> </dt>
<dd>test archive files.  This option extracts each specified
file in memory and compares the CRC (cyclic redundancy check, an enhanced
checksum) of the expanded file with the original file&rsquo;s stored CRC value.
</dd>

<dt><b>-T</b> </dt>
<dd>[most OSes] set the timestamp on the archive(s) to that of the newest
file in each one.  This corresponds to <i>zip</i>&rsquo;s <b>-go</b> option except that it can
be used on wildcard zipfiles (e.g., &lsquo;&lsquo;unzip -T \*.zip&rsquo;&rsquo;) and is much faster. </dd>

<dt><b>-u</b> </dt>
<dd>update
existing files and create new ones if needed.  This option performs the
same function as the <b>-f</b> option, extracting (with query) files that are newer
than those with the same name on disk, and in addition it extracts those
files that do not already exist on disk.  See <b>-f</b> above for information on
setting the timezone properly. </dd>

<dt><b>-v</b> </dt>
<dd>be verbose or print diagnostic version
info.  This option has evolved and now behaves as both an option and a modifier.
 As an option it has two purposes:  when a zipfile is specified with no
other options, <b>-v</b> lists archive files verbosely, adding to the basic <b>-l</b> info
the compression method, compressed size, compression ratio and 32-bit CRC.
 When no zipfile is specified (that is, the complete command is simply
&lsquo;&lsquo;unzip -v&rsquo;&rsquo;), a diagnostic screen is printed.  In addition to the normal header
with release date and version, <i>unzip</i> lists the home Info-ZIP ftp site and
where to find a list of other ftp and non-ftp sites; the target operating
system for which it was compiled, as well as (possibly) the hardware on
which it was compiled, the compiler and version used, and the compilation
date; any special compilation options that might affect the program&rsquo;s operation
(see also <b>DECRYPTION</b> below); and any options stored in environment variables
that might do the same (see <b>ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS</b> below).  As a modifier it
works in conjunction with other options (e.g., <b>-t</b>) to produce more verbose
or debugging output; this is not yet fully implemented but will be in future
releases. </dd>

<dt><b>-z</b> </dt>
<dd>display only the archive comment.   </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Modifiers</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>-a</b> </dt>
<dd>convert text files.
 Ordinarily all files are extracted exactly as they are stored (as &lsquo;&lsquo;binary&rsquo;&rsquo;
files).  The <b>-a</b> option causes files identified by <i>zip</i> as text files (those
with the &lsquo;t&rsquo; label in <i>zipinfo</i> listings, rather than &lsquo;b&rsquo;) to be automatically
extracted as such, converting line endings, end-of-file characters and the
character set itself as necessary. (For example, Unix files use line feeds
(LFs) for end-of-line (EOL) and have no end-of-file (EOF) marker; Macintoshes
use carriage returns (CRs) for EOLs; and most PC operating systems use
CR+LF for EOLs and control-Z for EOF.  In addition, IBM mainframes and the
Michigan Terminal System use EBCDIC rather than the more common ASCII character
set, and NT supports Unicode.) Note that <i>zip</i>&rsquo;s identification of text files
is by no means perfect; some &lsquo;&lsquo;text&rsquo;&rsquo; files may actually be binary and vice
versa.  <i>unzip</i> therefore prints &lsquo;&lsquo;[text]&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;[binary]&rsquo;&rsquo; as a visual check for
each file it extracts when using the <b>-a</b> option.  The <b>-aa</b> option forces all
files to be extracted as text, regardless of the supposed file type. </dd>

<dt><b>-b</b> </dt>
<dd>[general]
treat all files as binary (no text conversions).  This is a shortcut for
<b>---a</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-b</b> </dt>
<dd>[Tandem] force the creation files with filecode type 180 (&rsquo;C&rsquo;) when extracting
Zip entries marked as "text". (On Tandem, <b>-a</b> is enabled by default, see above).
</dd>

<dt><b>-b</b> </dt>
<dd>[VMS] auto-convert binary files (see <b>-a</b> above) to fixed-length, 512-byte
record format.  Doubling the option (<b>-bb</b>) forces all files to be extracted
in this format. When extracting to standard output (<b>-c</b> or <b>-p</b> option in effect),
the default conversion of text record delimiters is disabled for binary
(<b>-b</b>) resp. all (<b>-bb</b>) files. </dd>

<dt><b>-B</b> </dt>
<dd>[Unix only, and only if compiled with UNIXBACKUP
defined] save a backup copy of each overwritten file with a tilde appended
(e.g., the old copy of &lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo; is renamed to &lsquo;&lsquo;foo~&rsquo;&rsquo;).  This is similar to the default
behavior of <a href='emacs.1.html'><i>emacs</i>(1)</a>
 in many locations. </dd>

<dt><b>-C</b> </dt>
<dd>match filenames case-insensitively.
 <i>unzip</i>&rsquo;s philosophy is &lsquo;&lsquo;you get what you ask for&rsquo;&rsquo; (this is also responsible
for the <b>-L</b>/<b>-U</b> change; see the relevant options below).  Because some file
systems are fully case-sensitive (notably those under the Unix operating
system) and because both ZIP archives and <i>unzip</i> itself are portable across
platforms, <i>unzip</i>&rsquo;s default behavior is to match both wildcard and literal
filenames case-sensitively.  That is, specifying &lsquo;&lsquo;makefile&rsquo;&rsquo; on the command
line will <i>only</i> match &lsquo;&lsquo;makefile&rsquo;&rsquo; in the archive, not &lsquo;&lsquo;Makefile&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;MAKEFILE&rsquo;&rsquo;
(and similarly for wildcard specifications).  Since this does not correspond
to the behavior of many other operating/file systems (for example, OS/2
HPFS, which preserves mixed case but is not sensitive to it), the <b>-C</b> option
may be used to force all filename matches to be case-insensitive.  In the
example above, all three files would then match &lsquo;&lsquo;makefile&rsquo;&rsquo; (or &lsquo;&lsquo;make*&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
similar).  The <b>-C</b> option affects files in both the normal file list and the
excluded-file list (xlist). </dd>

<dt><b>-E</b> </dt>
<dd>[MacOS only] display contents of MacOS extra
field during restore operation. </dd>

<dt><b>-F</b> </dt>
<dd>[Acorn only] suppress removal of NFS filetype
extension from stored filenames. </dd>

<dt><b>-F</b> </dt>
<dd>[non-Acorn systems supporting long filenames
with embedded commas, and only if compiled with ACORN_FTYPE_NFS defined]
translate filetype information from ACORN RISC OS extra field blocks into
a NFS filetype extension and append it to the names of the extracted files.
(When the stored filename appears to already have an appended NFS filetype
extension, it is replaced by the info from the extra field.) </dd>

<dt><b>-i</b> </dt>
<dd>[MacOS only]
ignore filenames stored in MacOS extra fields. Instead, the most compatible
filename stored in the generic part of the entry&rsquo;s header is used. </dd>

<dt><b>-j</b> </dt>
<dd>junk
paths.  The archive&rsquo;s directory structure is not recreated; all files are
deposited in the extraction directory (by default, the current one). </dd>

<dt><b>-J</b> </dt>
<dd>[BeOS
only] junk file attributes.  The file&rsquo;s BeOS file attributes are not restored,
just the file&rsquo;s data. </dd>

<dt><b>-J</b> </dt>
<dd>[MacOS only] ignore MacOS extra fields.  All Macintosh
specific info is skipped. Data-fork and resource-fork are restored as separate
files. </dd>

<dt><b>-L</b> </dt>
<dd>convert to lowercase any filename originating on an uppercase-only
operating system or file system.  (This was <i>unzip</i>&rsquo;s default behavior in releases
prior to 5.11; the new default behavior is identical to the old behavior
with the <b>-U</b> option, which is now obsolete and will be removed in a future
release.)  Depending on the archiver, files archived under single-case file
systems (VMS, old MS-DOS FAT, etc.) may be stored as all-uppercase names;
this can be ugly or inconvenient when extracting to a case-preserving file
system such as OS/2 HPFS or a case-sensitive one such as under Unix.  By
default <i>unzip</i> lists and extracts such filenames exactly as they&rsquo;re stored
(excepting truncation, conversion of unsupported characters, etc.); this
option causes the names of all files from certain systems to be converted
to lowercase.  The <b>-LL</b> option forces conversion of every filename to lowercase,
regardless of the originating file system. </dd>

<dt><b>-M</b> </dt>
<dd>pipe all output through an
internal pager similar to the Unix <a href='more.1.html'><i>more</i>(1)</a>
 command.  At the end of a screenful
of output, <i>unzip</i> pauses with a &lsquo;&lsquo;--More--&rsquo;&rsquo; prompt; the next screenful may be viewed
by pressing the Enter (Return) key or the space bar.  <i>unzip</i> can be terminated
by pressing the &lsquo;&lsquo;q&rsquo;&rsquo; key and, on some systems, the Enter/Return key.  Unlike
Unix <a href='more.1.html'><i>more</i>(1)</a>
, there is no forward-searching or editing capability. Also,
<i>unzip</i> doesn&rsquo;t notice if long lines wrap at the edge of the screen, effectively
resulting in the printing of two or more lines and the likelihood that
some text will scroll off the top of the screen before being viewed. On
some systems the number of available lines on the screen is not detected,
in which case <i>unzip</i> assumes the height is 24 lines. </dd>

<dt><b>-n</b> </dt>
<dd>never overwrite existing
files.  If a file already exists, skip the extraction of that file without
prompting.  By default <i>unzip</i> queries before extracting any file that already
exists; the user may choose to overwrite only the current file, overwrite
all files, skip extraction of the current file, skip extraction of all
existing files, or rename the current file. </dd>

<dt><b>-N</b> </dt>
<dd>[Amiga] extract file comments
as Amiga filenotes.  File comments are created with the -c option of <a href='zip.1L.html'><i>zip</i>(1L)</a>
,
or with the -N option of the Amiga port of <a href='zip.1L.html'><i>zip</i>(1L)</a>
, which stores filenotes
as comments. </dd>

<dt><b>-o</b> </dt>
<dd>overwrite existing files without prompting.  This is a dangerous
option, so use it with care.  (It is often used with <b>-f</b>, however, and is
the only way to overwrite directory EAs under OS/2.) </dd>

<dt><b>-P</b>&nbsp;<i>password</i></dt>
<dd>use <i>password</i>
to decrypt encrypted zipfile entries (if any).  <b>THIS IS INSECURE!</b>  Many
multi-user operating systems provide ways for any user to see the current
command line of any other user; even on stand-alone systems there is always
the threat of over-the-shoulder peeking.  Storing the plaintext password as
part of a command line in an automated script is even worse. Whenever possible,
use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter passwords. (And where security
is truly important, use strong encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy instead
of the relatively weak encryption provided by standard zipfile utilities.)
</dd>

<dt><b>-q</b> </dt>
<dd>perform operations quietly (<b>-qq</b> = even quieter).  Ordinarily <i>unzip</i> prints
the names of the files it&rsquo;s extracting or testing, the extraction methods,
any file or zipfile comments that may be stored in the archive, and possibly
a summary when finished with each archive.  The <b>-q</b>[<b>q</b>] options suppress the
printing of some or all of these messages. </dd>

<dt><b>-s</b> </dt>
<dd>[OS/2, NT, MS-DOS] convert spaces
in filenames to underscores.  Since all PC operating systems allow spaces
in filenames, <i>unzip</i> by default extracts filenames with spaces intact (e.g.,
&lsquo;&lsquo;EA&nbsp;DATA.&nbsp;SF&rsquo;&rsquo;).  This can be awkward, however, since MS-DOS in particular does
not gracefully support spaces in filenames.  Conversion of spaces to underscores
can eliminate the awkwardness in some cases. </dd>

<dt><b>-U</b> </dt>
<dd>(obsolete; to be removed
in a future release) leave filenames uppercase if created under MS-DOS,
VMS, etc.  See <b>-L</b> above. </dd>

<dt><b>-V</b> </dt>
<dd>retain (VMS) file version numbers.  VMS files can
be stored with a version number, in the format file.ext;##.  By default the
&lsquo;&lsquo;;##&rsquo;&rsquo; version numbers are stripped, but this option allows them to be retained.
 (On file systems that limit filenames to particularly short lengths, the
version numbers may be truncated or stripped regardless of this option.)
</dd>

<dt><b>-X</b> </dt>
<dd>[VMS, Unix, OS/2, NT] restore owner/protection info (UICs) under VMS,
or user and group info (UID/GID) under Unix, or access control lists (ACLs)
under certain network-enabled versions of OS/2 (Warp Server with IBM LAN
Server/Requester 3.0 to 5.0; Warp Connect with IBM Peer 1.0), or security
ACLs under Windows NT.  In most cases this will require special system privileges,
and doubling the option (<b>-XX</b>) under NT instructs <i>unzip</i> to use privileges
for extraction; but under Unix, for example, a user who belongs to several
groups can restore files owned by any of those groups, as long as the user
IDs match his or her own.  Note that ordinary file attributes are always
restored--this option applies only to optional, extra ownership info available
on some operating systems.  [NT&rsquo;s access control lists do not appear to be
especially compatible with OS/2&rsquo;s, so no attempt is made at cross-platform
portability of access privileges.  It is not clear under what conditions
this would ever be useful anyway.] </dd>

<dt><b>-$</b> </dt>
<dd> [MS-DOS, OS/2, NT] restore the volume
label if the extraction medium is removable (e.g., a diskette).  Doubling
the option (<b>-$$</b>) allows fixed media (hard disks) to be labelled as well.
 By default, volume labels are ignored. </dd>

<dt><b>-/</b>&nbsp;<i>extensions</i></dt>
<dd>[Acorn only] overrides
the extension list supplied by Unzip$Ext environment variable. During extraction,
filename extensions that match one of the items in this extension list
are swapped in front of the base name of the extracted file. </dd>

<dt><b>-:</b> </dt>
<dd>[all but
Acorn, VM/CMS, MVS, Tandem] allows to extract archive members into locations
outside of the current &lsquo;&lsquo; extraction root folder&rsquo;&rsquo;. For security reasons, <i>unzip</i>
normally removes &lsquo;&lsquo;parent dir&rsquo;&rsquo; path components (&lsquo;&lsquo;../&rsquo;&rsquo;) from the names of extracted
file.  This safety feature (new for version 5.50) prevents <i>unzip</i> from accidentally
writing files to &lsquo;&lsquo;sensitive&rsquo;&rsquo; areas outside the active extraction folder tree
head.  The <b>-:</b> option lets <i>unzip</i> switch back to its previous, more liberal
behaviour, to allow exact extraction of (older) archives that used &lsquo;&lsquo;../&rsquo;&rsquo; components
to create multiple directory trees at the level of the current extraction
folder.  This option does not enable writing explicitly to the root directory
(&lsquo;&lsquo;/&rsquo;&rsquo;).  To achieve this, it is necessary to set the extraction target folder
to root (e.g. <b>-d / </b>).  However, when the <b>-:</b> option is specified, it is still
possible to implicitly write to the root directory by specifiying enough
&lsquo;&lsquo;../&rsquo;&rsquo; path components within the zip file. Use this option with extreme caution.

<p>   </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Environment Options</a></h2>
<i>unzip</i>&rsquo;s default behavior may be modified via options
placed in an environment variable.  This can be done with any option, but
it is probably most useful with the <b>-a</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-C</b>, <b>-q</b>, <b>-o</b>, or <b>-n</b> modifiers:  make
<i>unzip</i> auto-convert text files by default, make it convert filenames from
uppercase systems to lowercase, make it match names case-insensitively,
make it quieter, or make it always overwrite or never overwrite files as
it extracts them.  For example, to make <i>unzip</i> act as quietly as possible,
only reporting errors, one would use one of the following commands: <br>

<dl>

<dt>  Unix Bourne shell: </dt>
<dd>UNZIP=-qq; export UNZIP <br>
</dd>

<dt>  Unix C shell: </dt>
<dd>setenv UNZIP -qq <br>
</dd>

<dt>  OS/2 or MS-DOS: </dt>
<dd>set UNZIP=-qq <br>
</dd>

<dt>  VMS (quotes for <i>lowercase</i>): </dt>
<dd>define UNZIP_OPTS ""-qq"" </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Environment options
are, in effect, considered to be just like any other command-line options,
except that they are effectively the first options on the command line.
 To override an environment option, one may use the &lsquo;&lsquo;minus operator&rsquo;&rsquo; to remove
it.  For instance, to override one of the quiet-flags in the example above,
use the command <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip --q[other options] zipfile
</pre>  <p>
The first hyphen is the normal switch character, and the second is a
minus sign, acting on the q option. Thus the effect here is to cancel one
quantum of quietness.  To cancel both quiet flags, two (or more) minuses
may be used: <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -t--q zipfile
unzip ---qt zipfile
</pre>  <p>
(the two are equivalent).  This may seem awkward or confusing, but it
is reasonably intuitive:  just ignore the first hyphen and go from there.
 It is also consistent with the behavior of Unix <a href='nice.1.html'><i>nice</i>(1)</a>
. <p>
As suggested by
the examples above, the default variable names are UNZIP_OPTS for VMS (where
the symbol used to install <i>unzip</i> as a foreign command would otherwise be
confused with the environment variable), and UNZIP for all other operating
systems.  For compatibility with <a href='zip.1L.html'><i>zip</i>(1L)</a>
, UNZIPOPT is also accepted (don&rsquo;t
ask).  If both UNZIP and UNZIPOPT are defined, however, UNZIP takes precedence.
 <i>unzip</i>&rsquo;s diagnostic option (<b>-v</b> with no zipfile name) can be used to check
the values of all four possible <i>unzip</i> and <i>zipinfo</i> environment variables.
<p>
The timezone variable (TZ) should be set according to the local timezone
in order for the <b>-f</b> and <b>-u</b> to operate correctly.  See the description of <b>-f</b>
above for details.  This variable may also be necessary in order for timestamps
on extracted files to be set correctly. Under Windows 95/NT <i>unzip</i> should
know the correct timezone even if TZ is unset, assuming the timezone is
correctly set in the Control Panel.   
<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Decryption</a></h2>
Encrypted archives are fully
supported by Info-ZIP software, but due to United States export restrictions,
de-/encryption support might be disabled in your compiled binary.  However,
since spring 2000, US export restrictions have been liberated, and our
source archives do now include full crypt code. In case you need binary
distributions with crypt support enabled, see the file &lsquo;&lsquo;WHERE&rsquo;&rsquo; in any Info-ZIP
source or binary distribution for locations both inside and outside the
US. <p>
Some compiled versions of <i>unzip</i> may not support decryption. To check
a version for crypt support, either attempt to test or extract an encrypted
archive, or else check <i>unzip</i>&rsquo;s diagnostic screen (see the <b>-v</b> option above)
for &lsquo;&lsquo;[decryption]&rsquo;&rsquo; as one of the special compilation options. <p>
As noted above,
the <b>-P</b> option may be used to supply a password on the command line, but
at a cost in security.  The preferred decryption method is simply to extract
normally; if a zipfile member is encrypted, <i>unzip</i> will prompt for the password
without echoing what is typed. <i>unzip</i> continues to use the same password
as long as it appears to be valid, by testing a 12-byte header on each file.
 The correct password will always check out against the header, but there
is a 1-in-256 chance that an incorrect password will as well.  (This is a
security feature of the PKWARE zipfile format; it helps prevent brute-force
attacks that might otherwise gain a large speed advantage by testing only
the header.)  In the case that an incorrect password is given but it passes
the header test anyway, either an incorrect CRC will be generated for the
extracted data or else <i>unzip</i> will fail during the extraction because the
&lsquo;&lsquo;decrypted&rsquo;&rsquo; bytes do not constitute a valid compressed data stream. <p>
If the
first password fails the header check on some file, <i>unzip</i> will prompt for
another password, and so on until all files are extracted.  If a password
is not known, entering a null password (that is, just a carriage return
or &lsquo;&lsquo;Enter&rsquo;&rsquo;) is taken as a signal to skip all further prompting. Only unencrypted
files in the archive(s) will thereafter be extracted.  (In fact, that&rsquo;s not
quite true; older versions of <a href='zip.1L.html'><i>zip</i>(1L)</a>
 and <a href='zipcloak.1L.html'><i>zipcloak</i>(1L)</a>
 allowed null passwords,
so <i>unzip</i> checks each encrypted file to see if the null password works. 
This may result in &lsquo;&lsquo;false positives&rsquo;&rsquo; and extraction errors, as noted above.)
<p>
Archives encrypted with 8-bit passwords (for example, passwords with accented
European characters) may not be portable across systems and/or other archivers.
 This problem stems from the use of multiple encoding methods for such
characters, including Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) and OEM code page 850.  DOS <i>PKZIP</i>
2.04g uses the OEM code page; Windows <i>PKZIP</i> 2.50 uses Latin-1 (and is therefore
incompatible with DOS <i>PKZIP</i>); Info-ZIP uses the OEM code page on DOS, OS/2
and Win3.x ports but Latin-1 everywhere else; and Nico Mak&rsquo;s <i>WinZip</i> 6.x does
not allow 8-bit passwords at all. <i>UnZip</i> 5.3 (or newer) attempts to use the
default character set first (e.g., Latin-1), followed by the alternate one
(e.g., OEM code page) to test passwords.  On EBCDIC systems, if both of these
fail, EBCDIC encoding will be tested as a last resort.  (EBCDIC is not tested
on non-EBCDIC systems, because there are no known archivers that encrypt
using EBCDIC encoding.) ISO character encodings other than Latin-1 are not
supported.   
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Examples</a></h2>
To use <i>unzip</i> to extract all members of the archive
<i>letters.zip</i> into the current directory and subdirectories below it, creating
any subdirectories as necessary: <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip letters
</pre>  <p>
To extract all members of <i>letters.zip</i> into the current directory only:
<p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -j letters
</pre>  <p>
To test <i>letters.zip</i>, printing only a summary message indicating whether
the archive is OK or not: <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -tq letters
</pre>  <p>
To test <i>all</i> zipfiles in the current directory, printing only the summaries:
<p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -tq \*.zip
</pre>  <p>
(The backslash before the asterisk is only required if the shell expands
wildcards, as in Unix; double quotes could have been used instead, as in
the source examples below.)&nbsp;&nbsp;To extract to standard output all members of
<i>letters.zip</i> whose names end in <i>.tex</i>, auto-converting to the local end-of-line
convention and piping the output into <a href='more.1.html'><i>more</i>(1)</a>
: <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -ca letters \*.tex | more
</pre>  <p>
To extract the binary file <i>paper1.dvi</i> to standard output and pipe it to
a printing program: <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -p articles paper1.dvi | dvips
</pre>  <p>
To extract all FORTRAN and C source files--*.f, *.c, *.h, and Makefile--into
the /tmp directory: <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip source.zip "*.[fch]" Makefile -d /tmp
</pre>  <p>
(the double quotes are necessary only in Unix and only if globbing is
turned on).  To extract all FORTRAN and C source files, regardless of case
(e.g., both *.c and *.C, and any makefile, Makefile, MAKEFILE or similar):
<p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -C source.zip "*.[fch]" makefile -d /tmp
</pre>  <p>
To extract any such files but convert any uppercase MS-DOS or VMS names
to lowercase and convert the line-endings of all of the files to the local
standard (without respect to any files that might be marked &lsquo;&lsquo;binary&rsquo;&rsquo;): <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -aaCL source.zip "*.[fch]" makefile -d /tmp
</pre>  <p>
To extract only newer versions of the files already in the current directory,
without querying (NOTE:  be careful of unzipping in one timezone a zipfile
created in another--ZIP archives other than those created by Zip 2.1 or later
contain no timezone information, and a &lsquo;&lsquo;newer&rsquo;&rsquo; file from an eastern timezone
may, in fact, be older): <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -fo sources
</pre>  <p>
To extract newer versions of the files already in the current directory
and to create any files not already there (same caveat as previous example):
<p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -uo sources
</pre>  <p>
To display a diagnostic screen showing which <i>unzip</i> and <i>zipinfo</i> options
are stored in environment variables, whether decryption support was compiled
in, the compiler with which <i>unzip</i> was compiled, etc.: <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -v
</pre>  <p>
In the last five examples, assume that UNZIP or UNZIP_OPTS is set to
-q. To do a singly quiet listing: <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -l file.zip
</pre>  <p>
To do a doubly quiet listing: <p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip -ql file.zip
</pre>  <p>
(Note that the &lsquo;&lsquo;.zip&rsquo;&rsquo; is generally not necessary.)  To do a standard listing:
<p>
 <br>
<pre>unzip --ql file.zip
</pre>  or  <br>
<pre>unzip -l-q file.zip
</pre>  or  <br>
<pre>unzip -l--q file.zip
</pre>  (Extra minuses in options don&rsquo;t hurt.)   
<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Tips</a></h2>
The current maintainer, being
a lazy sort, finds it very useful to define a pair of aliases:  tt for
&lsquo;&lsquo;unzip -tq&rsquo;&rsquo; and ii for &lsquo;&lsquo;unzip -Z&rsquo;&rsquo; (or &lsquo;&lsquo;zipinfo&rsquo;&rsquo;).  One may then simply type &lsquo;&lsquo;tt zipfile&rsquo;&rsquo;
to test an archive, something that is worth making a habit of doing.  With
luck <i>unzip</i> will report &lsquo;&lsquo;No errors detected in compressed data of zipfile.zip,&rsquo;&rsquo;
after which one may breathe a sigh of relief. <p>
The maintainer also finds
it useful to set the UNZIP environment variable to &lsquo;&lsquo;-aL&rsquo;&rsquo; and is tempted to
add &lsquo;&lsquo;-C&rsquo;&rsquo; as well.  His ZIPINFO variable is set to &lsquo;&lsquo;-z&rsquo;&rsquo;.

The exit status

<p>
VMS interprets
standard Unix (or PC) return values as other, scarier-looking things, so
<i>unzip</i> instead maps them into VMS-style status codes.  The current mapping
is as follows:   1 (success) for normal exit, 0x7fff0001 for warning errors,
and (0x7fff000? + 16*normal_unzip_exit_status) for all other errors, where
the &lsquo;?&rsquo; is 2 (error) for <i>unzip</i> values 2, 9-11 and 80-82, and 4 (fatal error)
for the remaining ones (3-8, 50, 51).  In addition, there is a compilation
option to expand upon this behavior:  defining RETURN_CODES results in
a human-readable explanation of what the error status means.   
<h2><a name='sect11' href='#toc11'>Bugs</a></h2>
Multi-part
archives are not yet supported, except in conjunction with <i>zip</i>.  (All parts
must be concatenated together in order, and then &lsquo;&lsquo;zip -F&rsquo;&rsquo; must be performed
on the concatenated archive in order to &lsquo;&lsquo;fix&rsquo;&rsquo; it.)  This will definitely be
corrected in the next major release. <p>
Archives read from standard input are
not yet supported, except with <i>funzip</i> (and then only the first member of
the archive can be extracted). <p>
Archives encrypted with 8-bit passwords (e.g.,
passwords with accented European characters) may not be portable across
systems and/or other archivers.  See the discussion in <b>DECRYPTION</b> above.
<p>
<i>unzip</i>&rsquo;s <b>-M</b> (&lsquo;&lsquo;more&rsquo;&rsquo;) option tries to take into account automatic wrapping of
long lines. However, the code may fail to detect the correct wrapping locations.
First, TAB characters (and similar control sequences) are not taken into
account, they are handled as ordinary printable characters. Second, depending
on the actual system / OS port, <i>unzip</i> may not detect the true screen geometry
but rather rely on "commonly used" default dimensions. The correct handling
of tabs would require the implementation of a query for the actual tabulator
setup on the output console. <p>
Dates, times and permissions of stored directories
are not restored except under Unix. (On Windows NT and successors, timestamps
are now restored.) <p>
[MS-DOS] When extracting or testing files from an archive
on a defective floppy diskette, if the &lsquo;&lsquo;Fail&rsquo;&rsquo; option is chosen from DOS&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;Abort, Retry, Fail?&rsquo;&rsquo; message, older versions of <i>unzip</i> may hang the system,
requiring a reboot.  This problem appears to be fixed, but control-C (or
control-Break) can still be used to terminate <i>unzip</i>. <p>
Under DEC Ultrix, <i>unzip</i>
would sometimes fail on long zipfiles (bad CRC, not always reproducible).
 This was apparently due either to a hardware bug (cache memory) or an
operating system bug (improper handling of page faults?). Since Ultrix has
been abandoned in favor of Digital Unix (OSF/1), this may not be an issue
anymore. <p>
[Unix] Unix special files such as FIFO buffers (named pipes), block
devices and character devices are not restored even if they are somehow
represented in the zipfile, nor are hard-linked files relinked.  Basically
the only file types restored by <i>unzip</i> are regular files, directories and
symbolic (soft) links. <p>
[OS/2] Extended attributes for existing directories
are only updated if the <b>-o</b> (&lsquo;&lsquo;overwrite all&rsquo;&rsquo;) option is given.  This is a limitation
of the operating system; because directories only have a creation time
associated with them, <i>unzip</i> has no way to determine whether the stored
attributes are newer or older than those on disk.  In practice this may
mean a two-pass approach is required:  first unpack the archive normally
(with or without freshening/updating existing files), then overwrite just
the directory entries (e.g., &lsquo;&lsquo;unzip -o foo */&rsquo;&rsquo;). <p>
[VMS] When extracting to another
directory, only the <i>[.foo]</i> syntax is accepted for the <b>-d</b> option; the simple
Unix <i>foo</i> syntax is silently ignored (as is the less common VMS <i>foo.dir</i> syntax).
<p>
[VMS] When the file being extracted already exists, <i>unzip</i>&rsquo;s query only allows
skipping, overwriting or renaming; there should additionally be a choice
for creating a new version of the file.  In fact, the &lsquo;&lsquo;overwrite&rsquo;&rsquo; choice does
create a new version; the old version is not overwritten or deleted.
