<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pamoil</b> reads a Netpbm image as input and does an &quot;oil
transfer&quot;, and writes the same type of Netpbm image as output.

<P>The oil transfer is described in &quot;Beyond Photography&quot; by
Holzmann, chapter 4, photo 7.  It's a sort of localized smearing.

<P>The smearing works like this: First, assume a grayscale image.  For
each pixel in the image, <B>pamoil</B> looks at a square neighborhood
around it.  <B>pamoil</B> determines what is the most common pixel
intensity in the neighborhood, and puts a pixel of that intensity into
the output in the same position as the input pixel.

<P>For color images, or any arbitrary multi-channel image,
<B>pamoil</B> computes each channel (e.g. red, green, and blue)
separately the same way as the grayscale case above.

<P>At the edges of the image, where the regular neighborhood would run
off the edge of the image, <B>pamoil</B> uses a clipped neighborhood.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-n</B> <I>size</I>

<DD>This is the size of the neighborhood used in the smearing.  The
neighborhood is this many pixels in all four directions.

<P>The default is 3.
