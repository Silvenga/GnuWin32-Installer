<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
<p>
The <i>ar</i> utility is part of the Software Development Utilities
option. <p>
The <i>ar</i> utility can be used to create and maintain groups of files
combined into an archive. Once an archive has been created, new files can
be added, and existing files in an archive can be extracted, deleted, or
replaced. When an archive consists entirely of valid object files, the implementation
shall format the archive so that it is usable as a library for link editing
(see <i>c99</i> and <i>fort77</i>). When some of the archived files are not valid object
files, the suitability of the archive for library use is undefined.  If
an archive consists entirely of printable files, the entire archive shall
be printable. <p>
When <i>ar</i> creates an archive, it creates administrative information
indicating whether a symbol table is present in the archive. When there
is at least one object file that <i>ar</i> recognizes as such in the archive,
an archive symbol table shall be created in the archive and maintained
by <i>ar</i>; it is used by the link editor to search the archive. Whenever the
<i>ar</i> utility is used to create or update the contents of such an archive,
the symbol table shall be rebuilt. The <b>-s</b> option shall force the symbol table
to be rebuilt.  <p>
All <i>file</i> operands can be pathnames. However, files within
archives shall be named by a filename, which is the last component of the
pathname used when the file was entered into the archive. The comparison
of <i>file</i> operands to the names of files in archives shall be performed by
comparing the last component of the operand to the name of the file in
the archive. <p>
It is unspecified whether multiple files in the archive may
be identically named. In the case of such files, however, each <i>file</i>  and
<i>posname</i>  operand shall match only the first file in the archive having
a name that is the same as the last component of the operand. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Options</a></h2>
<p>
The
<i>ar</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001,
Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines. <p>
The following options shall be supported:

<dl>

<dt><b>-a</b> </dt>
<dd>Position new files in the archive after the file named by the <i>posname</i>
operand.  </dd>

<dt><b>-b</b> </dt>
<dd>Position new files in the archive before the file named by the
<i>posname</i> operand.  </dd>

<dt><b>-c</b> </dt>
<dd>Suppress the diagnostic message that is written to standard
error by default when the archive <i>archive</i> is created. </dd>

<dt><b>-C</b> </dt>
<dd>Prevent extracted
files from replacing like-named files in the file system. This option is
useful when <b>-T</b> is also used, to prevent truncated filenames from replacing
files with the same prefix. </dd>

<dt><b>-d</b> </dt>
<dd>Delete one or more <i>file</i>s from <i>archive</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>-i</b> </dt>
<dd>Position
new files in the archive before the file in the archive named by the <i>posname</i>
operand (equivalent to <b>-b</b>). </dd>

<dt><b>-m</b> </dt>
<dd>Move the named files in the archive. The <b>-a</b>,
<b>-b</b>, or <b>-i</b> options with the <i>posname</i> operand indicate the position; otherwise,
move the names files in the archive to the end of the archive.  </dd>

<dt><b>-p</b> </dt>
<dd>Write
the contents of the <i>file</i>s in the archive named by <i>file</i> operands from <i>archive</i>
to the standard output. If no <i>file</i> operands are specified, the contents
of all files in the archive shall be written in the order of the archive.
</dd>

<dt><b>-q</b> </dt>
<dd>Append the named files to the end of the archive. In this case <i>ar</i> does
not check whether the added files are already in the archive. This is useful
to bypass the searching otherwise done when creating a large archive piece
by piece.  </dd>

<dt><b>-r</b> </dt>
<dd>Replace or add <i>file</i>s to <i>archive</i>. If the archive named by <i>archive</i>
does not exist, a new archive shall be created and a diagnostic message
shall be written to standard error (unless the <b>-c</b> option is specified). If
no <i>file</i>s are specified and the <i>archive</i> exists, the results are undefined.
Files that replace existing files in the archive shall not change the order
of the archive. Files that do not replace existing files in the archive
shall be appended to the archive  unless a <b>-a</b>, <b>-b</b>, or <b>-i</b> option specifies
another position. </dd>

<dt><b>-s</b> </dt>
<dd>Force the regeneration of the archive symbol table even
if <i>ar</i> is not invoked with an option that modifies the archive contents.
This option is useful to restore the archive symbol table after it has
been stripped; see <i>strip</i>.  </dd>

<dt><b>-t</b> </dt>
<dd>Write a table of contents of <i>archive</i> to the
standard output. The files specified by the <i>file</i> operands shall be included
in the written list. If no <i>file</i> operands are specified, all files in <i>archive</i>
shall be included in the order of the archive. </dd>

<dt><b>-T</b> </dt>
<dd>Allow filename truncation
of extracted files whose archive names are longer than the file system
can support. By default, extracting a file with a name that is too long
shall be an error; a diagnostic message shall be written and the file shall
not be extracted.  </dd>

<dt><b>-u</b> </dt>
<dd>Update older files in the archive. When used with the
<b>-r</b> option, files in the archive shall be replaced only if the corresponding
<i>file</i> has a modification time that is at least as new as the modification
time of the file in the archive. </dd>

<dt><b>-v</b> </dt>
<dd>Give verbose output. When used with the
option characters <b>-d</b>, <b>-r</b>, or <b>-x</b>, write a detailed file-by-file description of
the archive creation and maintenance activity, as described in the STDOUT
section.  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
When used with <b>-p</b>, write the name of the file in the archive to
the standard output before writing the file in the archive itself to the
standard output, as described in the STDOUT section. <p>
When used with <b>-t</b>, include
a long listing of information about the files in the archive, as described
in the STDOUT section. 
<dl>

<dt><b>-x</b> </dt>
<dd>Extract the files in the archive named by the <i>file</i>
operands from <i>archive</i>. The contents of the archive shall not be changed.
If no <i>file</i> operands are given, all files in the archive shall be extracted.
The modification time of each file extracted shall be set to the time the
file is extracted from the archive. <p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Operands</a></h2>
<p>
The following operands shall
be supported: 
<dl>

<dt><i>archive</i> </dt>
<dd>A pathname of the archive. </dd>

<dt><i>file</i> </dt>
<dd>A pathname. Only the
last component shall be used when comparing against the names of files
in the archive. If two or more <i>file</i> operands have the same last pathname
component (basename), the results are unspecified. The implementation&rsquo;s archive
format shall not truncate valid filenames of files added to or replaced
in the archive. </dd>

<dt><i>posname</i> </dt>
<dd>The name of a file in the archive, used for relative
positioning; see options <b>-m</b> and <b>-r</b>.  <p>

<p>

<h2><a name='sect18' href='#toc18'>Rationale</a></h2>
<p>
The archive format is not described. It is recognized
that there are several known <i>ar</i> formats, which are not compatible. The <i>ar</i>
utility is included, however, to allow creation of archives that are intended
for use only on one machine. The archive is specified as a file, and it
can be moved as a file. This does allow an archive to be moved from one
machine to another machine that uses the same implementation of <i>ar</i>. <p>
Utilities
such as <i>pax</i> (and its forebears <i>tar</i> and <i>cpio</i>) also provide portable "archives".
This is a not a duplication; the <i>ar</i> utility is included to provide an interface
primarily for <i>make</i> and the compilers, based on a historical model. <p>
In historical
implementations, the <b>-q</b> option (available on XSI-conforming systems) is known
to execute quickly because <i>ar</i> does not check on whether the added members
are already in the archive. This is useful to bypass the searching otherwise
done when creating a large archive piece-by-piece. These remarks may but need
not remain true for a brand new implementation of this utility; hence,
these remarks have been moved into the RATIONALE. <p>
BSD implementations historically
required applications to provide the <b>-s</b> option whenever the archive was
supposed to contain a symbol table. As in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001,
System V historically creates or updates an archive symbol table whenever
an object file is removed from, added to, or updated in the archive. <p>
The
OPERANDS section requires what might seem to be true without specifying
it: the archive cannot truncate the filenames below {NAME_MAX}. Some historical
implementations do so, however, causing unexpected results for the application.
Therefore, this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 makes the requirement explicit
to avoid misunderstandings. <p>
According to the System V documentation, the
options <b>-dmpqrtx</b> are not required to begin with a hyphen ( <b>&rsquo;-&rsquo;</b> ). This volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that a conforming application use the leading
hyphen. <p>
The archive format used by the 4.4 BSD implementation is documented
in this RATIONALE as an example: A file created by <i>ar</i> begins with the "magic"
string <b>"!&lt;arch&gt;\n"</b> . The rest of the archive is made up of objects, each of
which is composed of a header for a file, a possible filename, and the
file contents. The header is portable between machine architectures, and,
if the file contents are printable, the archive is itself printable.  <p>
The
header is made up of six ASCII fields, followed by a two-character trailer.
The fields are the object name (16 characters), the file last modification
time (12 characters), the user and group IDs (each 6 characters), the file
mode (8 characters), and the file size (10 characters). All numeric fields
are in decimal, except for the file mode, which is in octal. <p>
The modification
time is the file <i>st_mtime</i> field. The user and group IDs are the file <i>st_uid</i>
and <i>st_gid</i> fields. The file mode is the file <i>st_mode</i> field. The file size
is the file <i>st_size</i> field. The two-byte trailer is the string <b>"&lsquo;&lt;newline&gt;"</b> .
<p>
Only the name field has any provision for overflow. If any filename is more
than 16 characters in length or contains an embedded space, the string
<b>"#1/"</b> followed by the ASCII length of the name is written in the name field.
The file size (stored in the archive header) is incremented by the length
of the name. The name is then written immediately following the archive
header. <p>
Any unused characters in any of these fields are written as &lt;space&gt;s.
If any fields are their particular maximum number of characters in length,
there is no separation between the fields. <p>
Objects in the archive are always
an even number of bytes long; files that are an odd number of bytes long
are padded with a &lt;newline&gt;, although the size in the header does not reflect
this. <p>
The <i>ar</i> utility description requires that (when all its members are
valid object files) <i>ar</i> produce an object code library, which the linkage
editor can use to extract object modules. If the linkage editor needs a
symbol table to permit random access to the archive, <i>ar</i> must provide it;
however, <i>ar</i> does not require a symbol table. <p>
The BSD <b>-o</b> option was omitted.
It is a rare conforming application that uses <i>ar</i> to extract object code
from a library with concern for its modification time, since this can only
be of importance to <i>make</i>. Hence, since this functionality is not deemed
important for applications portability, the modification time of the extracted
files is set to the current time. <p>
There is at least one known implementation
(for a small computer) that can accommodate only object files for that
system, disallowing mixed object and other files. The ability to handle
any type of file is not only historical practice for most implementations,
but is also a reasonable expectation. <p>
Consideration was given to changing
the output format of <i>ar</i> <b>-tv</b> to the same format as the output of <i>ls</i> <b>-l</b>. This
would have made parsing the output of <i>ar</i> the same as that of <i>ls</i>. This was
rejected in part because the current <i>ar</i> format is commonly used and changes
would break historical usage. Second, <i>ar</i> gives the user ID and group ID
in numeric format separated by a slash. Changing this to be the user name
and group name would not be correct if the archive were moved to a machine
that contained a different user database. Since <i>ar</i> cannot know whether the
archive was generated on the same machine, it cannot tell what to report.
<p>
The text on the <b>-ur</b> option combination is historical practice-since one filename
can easily represent two different files (for example, <b>/a/foo</b> and <b>/b/foo</b>),
it is reasonable to replace the file in the archive even when the modification
time in the archive is identical to that in the file system.
