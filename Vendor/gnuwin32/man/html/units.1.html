<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
units - unit conversion program 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Overview of &lsquo;units&rsquo;</a></h2>
The &lsquo;units&rsquo;
program converts quantities expressed in various scales to their equivalents
in other scales.  The &lsquo;units&rsquo; program can handle multiplicative scale changes
as well as nonlinear conversions such as Fahrenheit to  Celsius. Temperature
conversions require a special syntax.   See the examples below.   <p>
The units
are defined in an external data file.  You can use the extensive data file
that comes with this program, or you can  provide your own data file to
suit your needs.   <p>
You can use the program interactively  with prompts,
or you can use it from the command line.   <p>

<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Interacting with &lsquo;units&rsquo;</a></h2>
To invoke
units for interactive use, type &lsquo;units&rsquo; at your shell prompt.  The program
will print something like this: <p>
<br>
<pre>    2131 units, 53 prefixes, 24 nonlinear units
    
    You have:
</pre><p>
At the &lsquo;You have:&rsquo; prompt, type the quantity and units that you are converting
<i>from</i>.  For example, if you want to convert ten meters to feet, type &lsquo;10 meters&rsquo;.
 Next, &lsquo;units&rsquo; will print &lsquo;You want:&rsquo;.  You should type the type of units you
want to convert <i>to</i>.  To convert to feet, you would type &lsquo;feet&rsquo;.  Note that
if the readline library was compiled in then the tab key can be used to
complete unit names.  See <i>Readline support</i>, for more information about readline.
  <p>
The answer will be displayed in two ways.  The first line of output, which
is marked with a &lsquo;*&rsquo; to indicate multiplication,  gives the result of the
conversion you have asked for.  The second line of output, which is marked
with a &lsquo;/&rsquo; to indicate division, gives the inverse of the conversion factor.
 If you convert 10 meters to feet, &lsquo;units&rsquo; will print <p>
<br>
<pre>        * 32.808399
        / 0.03048
</pre><p>
which tells you that 10 meters equals about 32.8 feet.   The second number
gives the conversion in the opposite direction.  In this case, it tells
you that 1 foot is equal to about   0.03 dekameters since the dekameter
is 10 meters.   It also tells you that 1/32.8 is about .03.     <p>
The &lsquo;units&rsquo; program
prints the inverse because sometimes it is a more convenient number.  In
the example above, for example, the inverse value is an exact conversion:
a foot is exactly .03048 dekameters.   But the number given the other direction
is inexact.   <p>
If you try to convert grains to pounds, you will see the following:
<p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: grains
    You want: pounds
            * 0.00014285714
            / 7000
</pre><p>
From the second line of the output you can immediately see that a grain
is equal to a seven thousandth of a pound.  This is not so obvious from
the first line of the output.  If you find  the output format  confusing,
try using the &lsquo;--verbose&rsquo; option: <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: grain
    You want: aeginamina
            grain = 0.00010416667 aeginamina
            grain = (1 / 9600) aeginamina
</pre><p>
If you request a conversion between units which measure reciprocal dimensions,
then &lsquo;units&rsquo; will display the conversion results with an extra note indicating
that reciprocal conversion has been done: <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: 6 ohms
    You want: siemens
            reciprocal conversion
            * 0.16666667
            / 6
</pre><p>
Reciprocal conversion can be suppressed by using the &lsquo;--strict&rsquo; option. As usual,
use   the &lsquo;--verbose&rsquo; option to get more comprehensible output: <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: tex
    You want: typp
            reciprocal conversion
            1 / tex = 496.05465 typp
            1 / tex = (1 / 0.0020159069) typp
    You have: 20 mph
    You want: sec/mile
            reciprocal conversion
            1 / 20 mph = 180 sec/mile
            1 / 20 mph = (1 / 0.0055555556) sec/mile
</pre><p>
If you enter incompatible unit types, the &lsquo;units&rsquo; program will print a message
indicating that the units are not conformable and it will display the reduced
form for each unit: <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: ergs/hour
    You want: fathoms kg^2 / day 
    conformability error
            2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
            2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec
</pre><p>
If you only want to find the reduced form or definition of a unit, simply
press return at the &lsquo;You want:&rsquo; prompt.  Here is an example: <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: jansky
    You want: 
            Definition: fluxunit = 1e-26 W/m^2 Hz = 1e-26 kg / s^2
</pre><p>
The output from &lsquo;units&rsquo; indicates that the jansky is defined to be equal
to a fluxunit which in turn is defined to be a certain combination of watts,
meters, and hertz.  The fully reduced (and in this case somewhat more cryptic)
form appears on the far right.   <p>
Some named units are treated as dimensionless
in some situations. These include the radian and steradian.  These units
will be treated as equal to 1 in units conversions.  Power is equal to torque
times angular velocity.  This conversion can only be performed if the radian
is dimensionless.   <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: (14 ft lbf) (12 radians/sec)
    You want: watts
            * 227.77742
            / 0.0043902509
</pre><p>
Note that named dimensionaless units are not treated as dimensionless in
other contexts.  They cannot be used as exponents  so for example, &lsquo;meter^radian&rsquo;
is not allowed.   <p>
If you want a list of options you can type &lsquo;?&rsquo; at the  &lsquo;You
want:&rsquo; prompt.  The program will display a list of named units which are
conformable with the unit that you entered at the &lsquo;You have:&rsquo; prompt above.
 Note that conformable unit combinations will not appear on this list. 
 <p>
Typing &lsquo;help&rsquo; at either prompt displays a short help message.  You can also
type &lsquo;help&rsquo; followed by a unit name.  This will invoke a pager on the units
data base at the point where that unit is defined.  You can read the definition
and comments that may give more details or historical information about
the unit.  <p>
Typing &lsquo;search text&rsquo; will display a list of all of the units whose
names contain &lsquo;text&rsquo; as a substring along with their definitions. This may
help in the case where you aren&rsquo;t sure of the right unit name. <p>

<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Using &lsquo;units&rsquo;
Non-interactively</a></h2>
The &lsquo;units&rsquo; program can perform units conversions non-interactively
from the command line.  To do this, type the command, type the original
units expression, and type the new units you want.  You will probably need
to protect the units expressions from interpretation by the shell using
single quote characters.  <p>
If you type <p>
<br>
<pre>    units &rsquo;2 liters&rsquo; &rsquo;quarts&rsquo;
</pre><p>
then &lsquo;units&rsquo; will print <p>
<br>
<pre>        * 2.1133764
        / 0.47317647
</pre><p>
and then exit. The output tells you that 2 liters is about 2.1 quarts, or
alternatively that a quart is about 0.47 times 2 liters.   <p>
If the conversion
is successful, then &lsquo;units&rsquo; will return success (0) to the calling environment.
 If &lsquo;units&rsquo; is given non-conformable units to convert, it will print a message
giving the reduced form of each unit and it will return failure (nonzero)
to the calling environment.  <p>
When &lsquo;units&rsquo; is invoked with only one argument,
it will print out the definition of the specified unit.  It will return
failure if the unit is not defined and success if the unit is defined. <p>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Unit
Expressions</a></h2>
In order to enter more complicated units or fractions,  you
will need to use operations such as powers, products and division.   Powers
of units can be specified using the &lsquo;^&rsquo; character as shown in the following
example, or by simple concatenation: &lsquo;cm3&rsquo; is equivalent to  &lsquo;cm^3&rsquo;. If the exponent
is more than one digit, the &lsquo;^&rsquo; is required.  An exponent like &lsquo;2^3^2&rsquo; is evaluated
right to left.  The &lsquo;^&rsquo; operator has the second highest precedence.  The &lsquo;**&rsquo;
operator is provided as an alternative exponent operator.   <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: cm^3
    You want: gallons
            * 0.00026417205
            / 3785.4118
    You have: arabicfoot * arabictradepound * force
    You want: ft lbf  
            * 0.7296
            / 1.370614
</pre><p>
Multiplication of units can be specified by using spaces, or an asterisk
(&lsquo;*&rsquo;).  If &lsquo;units&rsquo; is invoked with the &lsquo;--product&rsquo; option then the hyphen (&lsquo;-&rsquo;) also
acts as a multiplication operator.  Division of units is indicated  by the
slash (&lsquo;/&rsquo;) or by &lsquo;per&rsquo;.   <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: furlongs per fortnight
    You want: m/s  
            * 0.00016630986
            / 6012.8727
</pre><p>
Historically, multiplication in units was assigned a higher precedence
than division.  This disagrees with the usual precedence rules which give
multiplication and division equal precedence, and it has been a source
of confusion for people who think of units as a calculator. <p>
By default,
multiplication using the star (&lsquo;*&rsquo;) now has the same precedence as division
and hence follows the usual precedence rules. If units is invoked with the
the &lsquo;--oldstar&rsquo; option then then the old behavior is activated and &lsquo;*&rsquo; will have
the same precedence as the other multiplication operators described next.
<p>
Multiplication using a space or using the hyphen has a higher precedence
than division and is evaluated left to right.  So @samp{m/s s/day} is equivalent
to &lsquo;m / s s day&rsquo; and has dimensions of length per time cubed.  Similarly,
&lsquo;1/2 meter&rsquo; refers to a unit of reciprocal length equivalent to .5/meter,
which is probably not what you would intend if you entered that expression.
  <p>
You can indicate division of numbers with the vertical dash (&lsquo;|&rsquo;), so if
you wanted half a meter you could write @samp{1|2 meter}.  This operator
has the highest precedence so the square root of two thirds could be written
&lsquo;2|3^1|2&rsquo;. <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: 1|2 inch
    You want: cm
            * 1.27
            / 0.78740157
</pre><p>
Parentheses can be used for grouping as desired.   <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: (1/2) kg / (kg/meter)
    You want: league
            * 0.00010356166
            / 9656.0833
</pre><p>
Prefixes are defined separately from base units.  In order to get centimeters,
the units database defines &lsquo;centi-&rsquo; and &lsquo;c-&rsquo; as prefixes.  Prefixes can appear
alone with no unit following them.   An exponent applies only to the immediately
preceding unit and its prefix so that &lsquo;cm^3&rsquo; or &lsquo;centimeter^3&rsquo; refer to cubic
centimeters  but &lsquo;centi*meter^3&rsquo; refers to hundredths of cubic meters.  Only
one prefix is permitted per unit, so &lsquo;micromicrofarad&rsquo; will fail, but &lsquo;micro*microfarad&rsquo;
will work, as will &lsquo;micro microfarad&rsquo;..   <p>
For &lsquo;units&rsquo;, numbers are just another
kind of unit.  They can appear as many times as you like and in any order
in a unit expression. For example, to find the volume of a box which is
2 ft by 3 ft by 12 ft in steres, you could do the following: <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: 2 ft 3 ft 12 ft
    You want: stere
            * 2.038813
            / 0.49048148
    
    You have: $ 5 / yard
    You want: cents / inch
            * 13.888889
            / 0.072
</pre><p>
And the second example shows how the dollar sign in the units conversion
can precede the five.  Be careful:  &lsquo;units&rsquo; will interpret &lsquo;$5&rsquo; with no space
as equivalent to dollars^5.   <p>
Outside of the SI system, it is often desirable
to add values of different units together.  You may also wish to use &lsquo;units&rsquo;
as a calculator that keeps track of units.  Sums of conformable units are
written with the &lsquo;+&rsquo; character.  <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: 2 hours + 23 minutes + 32 seconds
    You want: seconds
            * 8612
            / 0.00011611705
    
    You have: 12 ft + 3 in
    You want: cm
            * 373.38
            / 0.0026782366
    You have: 2 btu + 450 ft lbf
    You want: btu
            * 2.5782804
            / 0.38785542
</pre><p>
The expressions which are added together must reduce to identical expressions
in primitive units, or an error message will be displayed: <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: 12 printerspoint + 4 heredium
                                          ^
    Illegal sum of non-conformable units
</pre><p>
Historically &lsquo;-&rsquo; has been used for products of units, which complicates its
iterpretation in &lsquo;units&rsquo;.  Because &lsquo;units&rsquo; provides several other ways to obtain
unit products, and because &lsquo;-&rsquo; is a subtraction operator in general algebraic
expressions, &lsquo;units&rsquo; treats the binary &lsquo;-&rsquo; as a subtraction operator by default.
 This behavior can be altered using the &lsquo;--product&rsquo; option which causes &lsquo;units&rsquo;
to treat the binary &lsquo;-&rsquo; operator as a product operator.  Note that when &lsquo;-&rsquo; is
a multiplication operator it has the same precedence as &lsquo;*&rsquo;, but when &lsquo;-&rsquo; is
a subtraction operator it has the lower precedence as the addition operator.
  <p>
When &lsquo;-&rsquo; is used as a unary operator it negates its operand. Regardless of
the &lsquo;units&rsquo; options, if  &lsquo;-&rsquo; appears after &lsquo;(&rsquo; or after &lsquo;+&rsquo; then it will act as
a negation operator.  So you can always compute 20 degrees minus 12 minutes
by entering &lsquo;20 degrees + -12 arcmin&rsquo;. You must use this construction when
you define new units because you cannot know what options will be in force
when your definition is processed.  <p>
The &lsquo;+&rsquo; character sometimes appears in
exponents like &lsquo;3.43e+8&rsquo;.  This leads to an ambiguity in an expression like
&lsquo;3e+2 yC&rsquo;.  The unit &lsquo;e&rsquo; is a small unit of charge, so this can be regarded
as equivalent to &lsquo;(3e+2) yC&rsquo; or &lsquo;(3 e)+(2 yC)&rsquo;.   This ambiguity is resolved
by always interpreting &lsquo;+&rsquo; as part of an exponent if possible. <p>
Several built
in functions are provided: &lsquo;sin&rsquo;, &lsquo;cos&rsquo;, &lsquo;tan&rsquo;, &lsquo;ln&rsquo;, &lsquo;log&rsquo;, &lsquo;log2&rsquo;, &lsquo;exp&rsquo;, &lsquo;acos&rsquo;, &lsquo;atan&rsquo;
and &lsquo;asin&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;sin&rsquo;, &lsquo;cos&rsquo;, and &lsquo;tan&rsquo; functions require either a dimensionless
argument or an argument with dimensions of angle.   <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: sin(30 degrees)
    You want: 
            Definition: 0.5
    You have: sin(pi/2)
    You want:  
            Definition: 1
    You have: sin(3 kg)
                      ^
    Unit not dimensionless
</pre><p>
The other functions on the list require dimensionless arguments.  The inverse
trigonometric functions return arguments with dimensions of angle. <p>
If you
wish to take roots of units, you may use the &lsquo;sqrt&rsquo; or &lsquo;cuberoot&rsquo; functions.
 These functions require that the argument have the appropriate root.  Higher
roots can  be obtained by using fractional exponents: <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: sqrt(acre)
    You want: feet
            * 208.71074
            / 0.0047913202
    
    You have: (400 W/m^2 / stefanboltzmann)^(1/4)
    You have:
            Definition: 289.80882 K
    
    You have: cuberoot(hectare)
                              ^
    Unit not a root
</pre><p>
Nonlinear units are represented using functional notation.  They make possible
nonlinear unit conversions such temperature.  This is different from the
linear units that convert temperature differences.  Note the difference
below.  The absolute temperature conversions are handled by units starting
with &lsquo;temp&rsquo;, and you must use functional notation. The temperature differences
are done using units starting with &lsquo;deg&rsquo; and they do not require functional
notation. <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: tempF(45)
    You want: tempC
            7.2222222
    You have: 45 degF
    You want: degC
            * 25
            / 0.04
</pre><p>
Think of &lsquo;tempF(x)&rsquo; not as a function but as a notation which indicates that
&lsquo;x&rsquo; should have units of &lsquo;tempF&rsquo; attached to it.  See <i>Nonlinear units</i>.  The first
conversion shows that if it&rsquo;s 45 degrees Fahrehneit outside it&rsquo;s 7.2 degrees
Celsius.  The second conversions indicates that a change of 45 degrees Fahrenheit
corresponds to a change of 25 degrees Celsius. <p>
Some other examples of nonlinears
units are ring size and wire gauge.   There are numerous different gauges
and ring sizes.  See the units database for more details.  Note that wire
gauges with multiple zeroes are signified using negative numbers where
two zeroes is -1.  Alternatively, you can use the synonyms &lsquo;g00&rsquo;, &lsquo;g000&rsquo;, and
so on that are defined in the units database. <p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: wiregauge(11)
    You want: inches
            * 0.090742002
            / 11.020255
    You have: brwiregauge(g00)
    You want: inches
            * 0.348

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Invoking &lsquo;units&rsquo;</a></h2>
You invoke &lsquo;units&rsquo; like this: <p>
<br>
<pre>    units [OPTIONS] [FROM-UNIT [TO-UNIT]]
</pre><p>
If the FROM-UNIT and TO-UNIT are omitted, then the program will use interactive
prompts to determine which conversions to perform. See <i>Interactive use</i>. If
both FROM-UNIT and TO-UNIT are given, &lsquo;units&rsquo; will print the result of that
single conversion and then exit.   If only FROM-UNIT appears on the command
line, &lsquo;units&rsquo; will display the definition of that unit and exit.   Units specified
on the command line will need to be quoted to protect them from shell interpretation
and to group them into two arguments.  See <i>Command line use</i>. <p>
The following
options allow you to read in an alternative units file, check your units
file, or change the output format: <p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-c, --check</b> </dt>
<dd>Check that all units and prefixes
defined in the units data file reduce to primitive units.  Print a list
of all units that cannot be reduced.  Also display some other diagnostics
about  suspicious definitions in the units data file.  Note that only definitions
active in the current locale are checked.   </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>--check-verbose</b> </dt>
<dd>Like the &lsquo;-check&rsquo;
option, this option prints a list of units that cannot be reduced.  But
to help find unit  definitions that cause endless loops,  it lists the
units as they are checked.   If &lsquo;units&rsquo; hangs, then the last unit to be printed
has a bad definition.  Note that only definitions active in the current
locale are checked.   </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-o format, --output-format format</b> </dt>
<dd>Use the specified format
for numeric output.  Format is the same as that for the printf function
in the ANSI C standard.  For example, if you want more precision you might
use &lsquo;-o %.15g&rsquo;.  </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-f filename, --file filename</b> </dt>
<dd>Instruct &lsquo;units&rsquo; to load the units
file &lsquo;filename&rsquo;.   If &lsquo;filename&rsquo; is the empty string (&lsquo;-f "&rsquo;)  then the default
units file will be loaded.  This enables you to load the default file plus
a personal units file.  Up to 25 units files may be specified on the command
line. This option overrides the &lsquo;UNITSFILE&rsquo; environment variable.   </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-h, --help</b>
</dt>
<dd>Print out a summary of the options for &lsquo;units&rsquo;.   </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-m, --minus</b> </dt>
<dd>Causes &lsquo;-&rsquo; to be interpreted
as a subtraction operator.  This is usually the default behavior.   </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-p, --product</b>
</dt>
<dd>Causes &lsquo;-&rsquo; to be interpreted as a multiplication operator when it has two
operands.  It will as a negation operator when it has only one operand:
&lsquo;(-3)&rsquo;.  Note that by default &lsquo;-&rsquo; is treated as a subtraction operator. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
, --oldstar
Causes &lsquo;*&rsquo; to have the old style precedence, higher than the precedence of
division so that &lsquo;1/2*3&rsquo; will equal &lsquo;6&rsquo;. <p>
, --newstar Forces &lsquo;*&rsquo; to have the new
(default) precedence which follows the usual rules of algebra: the precedence
of &lsquo;*&rsquo; is the same as the precedence of &lsquo;/&rsquo;, so that &lsquo;1/2*3&rsquo; will equal &lsquo;3/2&rsquo;. <p>
,
--compact Give compact output featuring only the conversion factor.  This
turns off the &lsquo;--verbose&rsquo; option.  <p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-q, --quiet, --silent</b> </dt>
<dd>Suppress prompting of the
user for units and the display of statistics about the number of units
loaded. </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-s, --strict</b> </dt>
<dd>Suppress conversion of units to their reciprocal units.
 For  example, &lsquo;units&rsquo; will normally convert hertz to seconds because these
units are reciprocals of each other.  The strict option requires that units
be strictly conformable to perform a conversion, and will give an error
if you attempt to convert hertz to seconds.  </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-1, --one-line</b> </dt>
<dd>Give only one line
of output (the forward conversion).  Do not print the reverse conversion.
 Note that if a reciprocal conversion is performed then &lsquo;units&rsquo; will print
still print the "reciprocal conversion" line. </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-t, --terse</b> </dt>
<dd>Give terse output
when converting units.  This option can be used when calling &lsquo;units&rsquo; from
another program so that the output is easy to parse.  This option has the
combined effect of these options:  &lsquo;--strict&rsquo; &lsquo;--quiet&rsquo; &lsquo;--one-line&rsquo; &lsquo;--compact&rsquo;. </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-v, --verbose</b>

</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-V, --version</b>

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Unit Definitions</a></h2>
The
conversion information is read from a units data file which  is called
&lsquo;units.dat&rsquo; and is probably located in the &lsquo;/usr/local/share&rsquo; directory.   If
you invoke &lsquo;units&rsquo; with the &lsquo;-V&rsquo; option, it will print the location of this
file.  The default file includes definitions for all familiar units, abbreviations
and metric prefixes.  It also includes many obscure or archaic units.   <p>
Many
constants of nature are defined, including these: <blockquote><table border='0'>
<tr><td align='left'>pi</td><td align='left'>ratio of circumference
to diameter</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>c</td><td align='left'>speed of light</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>e</td><td align='left'>charge on an electron</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>force</td><td align='left'>acceleration of gravity</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>mole</td><td align='left'>Avogadro&rsquo;s

<tr><td align='left'>mach</td><td align='left'>speed of sound</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
The database includes
atomic masses for all of the elements and numerous other constants.  Also
included are the densities of various ingredients used in baking so that
&lsquo;2 cups flour_sifted&rsquo; can be converted  to &lsquo;grams&rsquo;.  This is not an exhaustive
list.  Consult the units data file to see the complete list, or to see the
definitions that are used. <p>
The unit &lsquo;pound&rsquo; is a unit of mass.  To get force,
multiply by the force conversion unit &lsquo;force&rsquo; or use the shorthand &lsquo;lbf&rsquo;. (Note
that &lsquo;g&rsquo; is already taken as the standard abbreviation for the gram.)  The
unit &lsquo;ounce&rsquo; is also a unit of mass.  The fluid ounce is &lsquo;fluidounce&rsquo; or &lsquo;floz&rsquo;.
 British capacity units that differ from their US counterparts, such as
the British Imperial gallon, are prefixed with &lsquo;br&rsquo;.  Currency is prefixed
with its country name: &lsquo;belgiumfranc&rsquo;, &lsquo;britainpound&rsquo;. <p>
The US Survey foot, yard,
and mile can be obtained by using the &lsquo;US&rsquo; prefix.  These units differ slightly
from the international length units.   They were in general use until 1959,
and are still used for geographic surveys. The acre is officially defined
in terms of the US Survey foot. If you want an acre  defined according to
the international foot, use &lsquo;intacre&rsquo;.  The  difference between these units
is  about 4 parts per million.  The British also used a slightly different
length measure before 1959.   These can be obtained with the prefix &lsquo;UK&rsquo;. 
<p>
When searching for a unit, if the specified string does not appear exactly
as a unit name, then the &lsquo;units&rsquo; program will try to remove a  trailing &lsquo;s&rsquo;
or a trailing &lsquo;es&rsquo;.  If that fails, &lsquo;units&rsquo; will check for a prefix.   All of
the standard metric prefixes are defined. <p>
To find out what units and prefixes
are available, read the standard units data file. <p>

<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Defining New Units</a></h2>
All
of the units and prefixes that &lsquo;units&rsquo; can convert are defined in the units
data file.  If you want to add your own units, you can supply your own file.
 You can also add your own units definitions in the &lsquo;.units.dat&rsquo; file in your
home directory.  If this file exists it is read before the units data file.
 It will not be read if any units files are specified on the command line.
  <p>
A unit is specified on a single line by giving its name and an equivalence.
 Comments start with a &lsquo;#&rsquo; character, which can appear anywhere in a line.
 The backslash character (&lsquo;&rsquo;) acts as a continuation character if it appears
as the last character on a line, making it possible to spread definitions
out over several lines if desired. A file can be included by giving the
command &lsquo;!include&rsquo; followed by the file&rsquo;s name.  The file will be sought in
the same directory as the parent file unless a full path is given.   <p>
Unit
names must not contain any of the operator characters &lsquo;+&rsquo;, &lsquo;-&rsquo;, &lsquo;*&rsquo;, &lsquo;/&rsquo;, &lsquo;|&rsquo;, &lsquo;^&rsquo; or
the parentheses. They cannot begin with a digit or a decimal point (&lsquo;.&rsquo;), nor
can they end with a digit (except for zero).   Be careful to define new
units in terms of old ones so that a reduction leads to the primitive units,
which are marked with &lsquo;!&rsquo; characters.   Dimensionless units are indicated
by using the string &lsquo;!dimensionless&rsquo; for the unit definition.   <p>
When adding
new units, be sure to use the &lsquo;-c&rsquo; option to check that the new units reduce
properly.   If you create a loop in the units definitions, then &lsquo;units&rsquo; will
hang when invoked with the &lsquo;-c&rsquo; options.  You will need to  use the &lsquo;--check-verbose&rsquo;
option which prints out each unit as it checks them.  The program will still
hang, but the last unit printed will be the unit which caused the infinite
loop. <p>
If you define any units which contain &lsquo;+&rsquo; characters, carefully check
them because the &lsquo;-c&rsquo; option will not catch non-conformable sums.  Be careful
with the &lsquo;-&rsquo; operator as well.  When used as a binary operator, the &lsquo;-&rsquo; character
can perform addition or multiplication depending on the options used to
invoke &lsquo;units&rsquo;. To ensure consistent behavior use &lsquo;-&rsquo; only as a unary negation
operator when writing units definitions.  To multiply two units leave a
space or use the &lsquo;*&rsquo; operator with care, recalling that it has two possible
precedence values and may require parentheses to ensure consistent behavior.
 To compute the difference  of &lsquo;foo&rsquo; and &lsquo;bar&rsquo; write &lsquo;foo+(-bar)&rsquo; or even &lsquo;foo+-bar&rsquo;.
<p>
Here is an example of a short units file that defines some basic units:
  <blockquote><table border='0'>
<tr><td align='left'>m</td><td align='left'>!</td><td align='left'># The meter is a primitive unit</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>sec</td><td align='left'>!</td><td align='left'># The second is a primitive unit</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>rad</td><td align='left'>!dimensionless</td><td align='left'>#
The second is a primitive unit</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>micro-</td><td align='left'>1e-6</td><td align='left'># Define a prefix</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>minute</td><td align='left'>60 sec</td><td align='left'># A
minute is 60 seconds</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>hour</td><td align='left'>60 min</td><td align='left'># An hour is 60 minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>inch</td><td align='left'>0.0254 m</td><td align='left'># Inch
defined in terms of meters</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>ft</td><td align='left'>12 inches</td><td align='left'># The foot defined in terms of inches</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>mile</td><td align='left'>5280
ft</td><td align='left'># And the mile</td></tr>
</table>
<blockquote><p>
A unit which ends with a &lsquo;-&rsquo; character is a prefix.  If a prefix
definition contains any &lsquo;/&rsquo; characters, be sure they are protected by parentheses.
 If you define &lsquo;half- 1/2&rsquo; then &lsquo;halfmeter&rsquo; would be equivalent to &lsquo;1 / 2 meter&rsquo;.

<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Defining Nonlinear Units</a></h2>
Some units conversions of interest are nonlinear;
for example, temperature conversions between the Fahrenheit and Celsius
scales cannot be done by simply multiplying by conversions factors.   <p>
When
you give a linear unit definition such as &lsquo;inch 2.54 cm&rsquo; you are providing
information that &lsquo;units&rsquo; uses to convert values in inches into primitive
units of meters.  For nonlinear units, you give a functional definition
that provides the same information.   <p>
Nonlinear units are represented using
a functional notation.   It is best to regard this notation not as a function
call but  as a way of adding units to a number, much the same way that
writing a linear unit name after a number adds units to that number. Internally,
nonlinear units are defined by a pair of functions which convert to and
from linear units in the data file, so that  an eventual conversion to
primitive units is possible.   <p>
Here is an example nonlinear unit definition:
<p>
<br>
<pre>tempF(x) [1;K] (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp ; (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32
</pre><p>
A nonlinear unit definition comprises a unit name, a dummy parameter name,
two functions, and two corresponding units.  The functions tell &lsquo;units&rsquo; how
to convert to and from the new unit.  In order to  produce valid results,
the arguments of these functions need to have the correct dimensions.  To
facilitate error checking, you may specify the dimensions.  <p>
The definition
begins with the unit name followed immediately (with no spaces) by a &lsquo;(&rsquo;
character.  In parentheses is the name of the parameter.  Next is an optional
specification of the units required by the functions in this definition.
 In the example above, the &lsquo;tempF&rsquo; function requires an input argument conformable
with &lsquo;1&rsquo;.  For normal nonlinear units definitions the forward  function will
always take a dimensionless argument.   The inverse function requires an
input argument conformable with &lsquo;K&rsquo;.  In general the inverse function will
need units that match the quantity measured by your nonlinear unit.  The
sole purpose of the expression in brackets to enable &lsquo;units&rsquo; to perform error
checking on function arguments. <p>
Next the function definitions appear.  In
the example above, the &lsquo;tempF&rsquo; function is defined by <p>
<br>
<pre>    tempF(x) = (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp
</pre><p>
This gives a rule for converting &lsquo;x&rsquo; in the units &lsquo;tempF&rsquo; to linear units of
absolute temperature, which makes it possible to  convert from tempF to
other units.  <p>
In order to make conversions to Fahrenheit possible, you must
give a rule for the inverse conversions. The inverse will be &lsquo;x(tempF)&rsquo; and
its definition appears after a &lsquo;;&rsquo; character.   In our example, the inverse
is <p>
<br>
<pre>    x(tempF) = (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32
</pre><p>
This inverse definition takes an absolute temperature as its argument and
converts it to the Fahrenheit temperature.  The inverse can be omitted by
leaving out the &lsquo;;&rsquo; character, but then conversions to the unit will be impossible.
 If the inverse is omitted then the &lsquo;--check&rsquo; option will display a warning.
 It is up to you to calculate and enter the correct inverse function to
obtain proper conversions.  The &lsquo;--check&rsquo; option tests the inverse at one point
and print an error if it is not valid there, but this is not a guarantee
that your inverse is correct. <p>
If you wish to make synonyms for nonlinear
units, you still need to define both the forward and inverse functions.
 Inverse functions can be obtained using the &lsquo;~&rsquo; operator.  So to create a
synonym  for &lsquo;tempF&rsquo; you could write <p>
<br>
<pre>    fahrenheit(x) [1;K] tempF(x); ~tempF(fahrenheit)
</pre><p>
You may occasionally wish to define a function that operates on units. 
 This can be done using a nonlinear unit definition.  For example, the definition
below provides conversion between radius and the area of a circle.  Note
that this definition requires a length as input and produces an area as
output, as indicated by the specification in brackets.  <p>
<br>
<pre>    circlearea(r) [m;m^2] pi r^2 ; sqrt(circlearea/pi)
</pre><p>
Sometimes you may be interested in a piecewise linear unit such as  many
wire gauges.  Piecewise linear units can be defined by specifying conversions
to linear units on a list of points. Conversion at other points will be
done by linear interpolation. A partial definition of zinc gauge is <p>
<br>
<pre>    zincgauge[in] 1 0.002, 10 0.02, 15 0.04, 19 0.06, 23 0.1
</pre><p>
In this example, &lsquo;zincgauge&rsquo; is the name of the piecewise linear unit.  The
definition of such a unit is indicated by the embedded &lsquo;[&rsquo; character.  After
the bracket, you should indicate the units to be attached to the numbers
in the table.   No spaces can appear before the &lsquo;]&rsquo; character, so a definition
like &lsquo;foo[kg meters]&rsquo; is illegal; instead write &lsquo;foo[kg*meters]&rsquo;.  The definition
of the unit consists of a list of pairs optionally separated by commas.
  This list defines a function for converting from the piecewise linear
unit to linear units.  The first item in each pair is the function argument;
the second item is the value of the function at that argument (in the units
specified in brackets). In this example, we define &lsquo;zincgauge&rsquo; at five points.
 For example, we set &lsquo;<a href='zincgauge.1.html'>zincgauge(1)</a>
&rsquo; equal to &lsquo;0.002 in&rsquo;.  Definitions like this
may be  more readable  if written using  continuation characters as <blockquote><br>
<pre>zincgauge[in]         \
        1        0.002 \
        10        0.02 \
        15        0.04 \
        19        0.06 \
        23        0.1    
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
With the preceeding definition, the following conversion can be performed:
<p>
<br>
<pre>    You have: zincgauge(10)
    You want: in
        * 0.02
        / 50
    You have: .01 inch
    You want: zincgauge
        5
</pre><p>
If you define a piecewise linear unit that is not strictly monotonic, then
the inverse will not be well defined.  If the inverse is requested for such
a unit, &lsquo;units&rsquo; will return the smallest inverse.  The &lsquo;--check&rsquo; option will print
a warning if a non-monotonic piecewise linear unit is encountered.   <p>

<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Localization</a></h2>
Some
units have different values in different locations.  The localization feature
accomodates this by allowing the units database to specify region dependent
definitions.   A locale region in the units database begins with &lsquo;!locale&rsquo;
followed by the name of the locale. The leading &lsquo;!&rsquo; must appear in the first
column of the units database.  The locale region is terminated by &lsquo;!endlocale&rsquo;.
 The following example shows how to define a couple units in a locale. <p>
<br>
<pre>!locale en_GB
ton                     brton
gallon                  brgallon
!endlocale
</pre><p>
The current locale is specified by the &lsquo;LOCALE&rsquo; environment variable.  Note
that the &lsquo;-c&rsquo; option only checks the definitions which are active for the
current locale. <p>

<h2><a name='sect10' href='#toc10'>Environment Variables</a></h2>
The &lsquo;units&rsquo; programs uses the following
environment variables.  <p>

<dl>

<dt><b>LOCALE</b> </dt>
<dd>Specifies the locale.  The default is &lsquo;en_US&rsquo;.
 Sections of the units database are specific to certain locales.   </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>PAGER</b>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the pager to use for help and for displaying the conformable
units.  The help function browses the units database and calls the pager
using the &lsquo;+nn&rsquo; syntax for specifying a line number.  The default pager is
&lsquo;more&rsquo;, but &lsquo;less&rsquo;, &lsquo;emacs&rsquo;, or &lsquo;vi&rsquo; are possible alternatives.   </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>UNITSFILE</b> </dt>
<dd>Specifies
the units database file to use (instead of the default). This will be overridden
by the &lsquo;-f&rsquo; option.  Note that you can only specify a single units database
using this environment variable.  </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<h2><a name='sect11' href='#toc11'>Readline Support</a></h2>
If the &lsquo;readline&rsquo; package
has been compiled in, then when &lsquo;units&rsquo; is used interactively, numerous command
line editing features are available.  To check if your version of &lsquo;units&rsquo;
includes the readline, invoke the program with the &lsquo;--version&rsquo; option. <p>
For complete
information about readline, consult the documentation for the readline
package.  Without any configuration, &lsquo;units&rsquo; will allow editing in the style
of emacs.  Of particular use with &lsquo;units&rsquo; are the completion commands.   <p>
If
you type a few characters and then hit &lsquo;ESC&rsquo; followed by the &lsquo;?&rsquo; key then &lsquo;units&rsquo;
will display a list of all the units which start with the characters typed.
 For example, if you type &lsquo;metr&rsquo; and then request completion, you will see
something like this: <p>
<br>
<pre>You have: metr
metre             metriccup         metrichorsepower  metrictenth
metretes          metricfifth       metricounce       metricton
metriccarat       metricgrain       metricquart       metricyarncount
You have: metr
</pre><p>
If there is a unique way to complete a unitname, you can hit the tab key
and &lsquo;units&rsquo; will provide the rest of the unit name.  If &lsquo;units&rsquo; beeps, it means
that there is no unique completion.  Pressing the tab key a second time
will print the list of all completions.   <p>
