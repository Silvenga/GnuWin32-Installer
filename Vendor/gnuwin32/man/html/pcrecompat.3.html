PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Differences Between Pcre and
Perl</a></h2>
 <p>
This document describes the differences in the ways that PCRE and
Perl handle regular expressions. The differences described here are mainly
with respect to Perl 5.8, though PCRE version 7.0 contains some features
that are expected to be in the forthcoming Perl 5.10. <p>
1. PCRE has only a subset
of Perl&rsquo;s UTF-8 and Unicode support. Details of what it does have are given
in the   section on UTF-8 support  in the main  <b>pcre</b>  page. <p>
2. PCRE does not
allow repeat quantifiers on lookahead assertions. Perl permits them, but
they do not mean what you might think. For example, (?!a){3} does not assert
that the next three characters are not "a". It just asserts that the next
character is not "a" three times. <p>
3. Capturing subpatterns that occur inside
negative lookahead assertions are counted, but their entries in the offsets
vector are never set. Perl sets its numerical variables from any such patterns
that are matched before the assertion fails to match something (thereby
succeeding), but only if the negative lookahead assertion contains just
one branch. <p>
4. Though binary zero characters are supported in the subject
string, they are not allowed in a pattern string because it is passed as
a normal C string, terminated by zero. The escape sequence \0 can be used
in the pattern to represent a binary zero. <p>
5. The following Perl escape sequences
are not supported: \l, \u, \L, \U, and \N. In fact these are implemented by Perl&rsquo;s
general string-handling and are not part of its pattern matching engine.
If any of these are encountered by PCRE, an error is generated. <p>
6. The Perl
escape sequences \p, \P, and \X are supported only if PCRE is built with Unicode
character property support. The properties that can be tested with \p and
\P are limited to the general category properties such as Lu and Nd, script
names such as Greek or Han, and the derived properties Any and L&amp;. <p>
7. PCRE
does support the \Q...\E escape for quoting substrings. Characters in between
are treated as literals. This is slightly different from Perl in that $
and @ are also handled as literals inside the quotes. In Perl, they cause
variable interpolation (but of course PCRE does not have variables). Note
the following examples: <p>
    Pattern            PCRE matches      Perl matches<br>
 <p>
     \Qabc$xyz\E        abc$xyz           abc followed by the<br>
                                            contents of $xyz<br>
     \Qabc\$xyz\E       abc\$xyz          abc\$xyz<br>
     \Qabc\E\$\Qxyz\E   abc$xyz           abc$xyz<br>
 <p>
The \Q...\E sequence is recognized both inside and outside character classes.
<p>
8. Fairly obviously, PCRE does not support the (?{code}) and (??{code})
constructions. However, there is support for recursive patterns. This is
not available in Perl 5.8, but will be in Perl 5.10. Also, the PCRE "callout"
feature allows an external function to be called during pattern matching.
See the  <b>pcrecallout</b>  documentation for details. <p>
9. Subpatterns that are
called recursively or as "subroutines" are always treated as atomic groups
in PCRE. This is like Python, but unlike Perl. <p>
10. There are some differences
that are concerned with the settings of captured strings when part of a
pattern is repeated. For example, matching "aba" against the pattern /^(a(b)?)+$/
in Perl leaves $2 unset, but in PCRE it is set to "b". <p>
11. PCRE provides
some extensions to the Perl regular expression facilities. Perl 5.10 will
include new features that are not in earlier versions, some of which (such
as named parentheses) have been in PCRE for some time. This list is with
respect to Perl 5.10: <p>
(a) Although lookbehind assertions must match fixed
length strings, each alternative branch of a lookbehind assertion can match
a different length of string. Perl requires them all to have the same length.
<p>
(b) If PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY is set and PCRE_MULTILINE is not set, the $
meta-character matches only at the very end of the string. <p>
(c) If PCRE_EXTRA
is set, a backslash followed by a letter with no special meaning is faulted.
Otherwise, like Perl, the backslash is ignored. (Perl can be made to issue
a warning.) <p>
(d) If PCRE_UNGREEDY is set, the greediness of the repetition
quantifiers is inverted, that is, by default they are not greedy, but if
followed by a question mark they are. <p>
(e) PCRE_ANCHORED can be used at matching
time to force a pattern to be tried only at the first matching position
in the subject string. <p>
(f) The PCRE_NOTBOL, PCRE_NOTEOL, PCRE_NOTEMPTY,
and PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE options for <b>pcre_exec()</b> have no Perl equivalents.
<p>
(g) The callout facility is PCRE-specific. <p>
(h) The partial matching facility
is PCRE-specific. <p>
(i) Patterns compiled by PCRE can be saved and re-used at
a later time, even on different hosts that have the other endianness. <p>
(j)
The alternative matching function (<b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>) matches in a different
way and is not Perl-compatible. <p>
