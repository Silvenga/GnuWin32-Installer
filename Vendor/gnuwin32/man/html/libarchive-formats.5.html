The  library reads and writes
a variety of streaming archive formats. Generally speaking, all of these
archive formats consist of a series of  Each entry stores a single file
system object, such as a file, directory, or symbolic link.  The following
provides a brief description of each format supported by libarchive, with
some information about recognized extensions or limitations of the current
library support. Note that just because a format is supported by libarchive
does not imply that a program that uses libarchive will support that format.
Applications that use libarchive specify which formats they wish to support.
 The  library can read most tar archives. However, it only writes POSIX-standard
 and  formats.  All tar formats store each entry in one or more 512-byte
records. The first record is used for file metadata, including filename,
timestamp, and mode information, and the file data is stored in subsequent
records. Later variants have extended this by either appropriating undefined
areas of the header record, extending the header to multiple records, or
by storing special entries that modify the interpretation of subsequent
entries.    The  library can read GNU-format tar archives. It currently supports
the most popular GNU extensions, including modern long filename and linkname
support, as well as atime and ctime data. The libarchive library does not
support multi-volume archives, nor the old GNU long filename format. It can
read GNU sparse file entries, including the new POSIX-based formats, but
cannot write GNU sparse file entries.  The  library can read and write POSIX-compliant
pax interchange format archives. Pax interchange format archives are an
extension of the older ustar format that adds a separate entry with additional
attributes stored as key/value pairs. The presence of this additional entry
is the only difference between pax interchange format and the older ustar
format. The extended attributes are of unlimited length and are stored as
UTF-8 Unicode strings. Keywords defined in the standard are in all lowercase;
vendors are allowed to define custom keys by preceding them with the vendor
name in all uppercase. When writing pax archives, libarchive uses many of
the SCHILY keys defined by Joerg Schilling&rsquo;s  archiver. The libarchive library
can read most of the SCHILY keys. It silently ignores any keywords that
it does not understand.  The libarchive library can also write pax archives
in which it attempts to suppress the extended attributes entry whenever
possible. The result will be identical to a ustar archive unless the extended
attributes entry is required to store a long file name, long linkname,
extended ACL, file flags, or if any of the standard ustar data (user name,
group name, UID, GID, etc) cannot be fully represented in the ustar header.
In all cases, the result can be dearchived by any program that can read
POSIX-compliant pax interchange format archives. Programs that correctly
read ustar format (see below) will also be able to read this format; any
extended attributes will be extracted as separate files stored in  directories.
 The libarchive library can both read and write this format. This format
has the following limitations:   Device major and minor numbers are limited
to 21 bits. Nodes with larger numbers will not be added to the archive. 
Path names in the archive are limited to 255 bytes. (Shorter if there is
no / character in exactly the right place.)  Symbolic links and hard links
are stored in the archive with the name of the referenced file. This name
is limited to 100 bytes.  Extended attributes, file flags, and other extended
security information cannot be stored.  Archive entries are limited to 2
gigabytes in size.  Note that the pax interchange format has none of these
restrictions.   The libarchive library can also read a variety of commonly-used
extensions to the basic tar format. In particular, it supports base-256 values
in certain numeric fields. This essentially removes the limitations on file
size, modification time, and device numbers.  The first tar program appeared
in Seventh Edition Unix in 1979. The first official standard for the tar
file format was the  (Unix Standard Tar) format defined by POSIX in 1988.
POSIX.1-2001 extended the ustar format to create the  format.  The libarchive
library can read a number of common cpio variants and can write  and  format
archives. A cpio archive stores each entry as a fixed-size header followed
by a variable-length filename and variable-length data. Unlike tar, cpio does
only minimal padding of the header or file data. There are a variety of
cpio formats, which differ primarily in how they store the initial header:
some store the values as octal or hexadecimal numbers in ASCII, others
as binary values of varying byte order and length.   The libarchive library
can read both big-endian and little-endian variants of the original binary
cpio format. This format used 32-bit binary values for file size and mtime,
and 16-bit binary values for the other fields.  The libarchive library can
both read and write this POSIX-standard format. This format stores the header
contents as octal values in ASCII. It is standard, portable, and immune
from byte-order confusion. File sizes and mtime are limited to 33 bits (8GB
file size), other fields are limited to 18 bits.  The libarchive library
can read both CRC and non-CRC variants of this format. The SVR4 format uses
eight-digit hexadecimal values for all header fields. This limits file size
to 4GB, and also limits the mtime and other fields to 32 bits. The SVR4
format can optionally include a CRC of the file contents, although libarchive
does not currently verify this CRC.   Cpio first appeared in PWB/UNIX 1.0,
which was released within AT&amp;T in 1977. PWB/UNIX 1.0 formed the basis of System
III Unix, released outside of AT&amp;T in 1981. This makes cpio older than tar,
although cpio was not included in Version 7 AT&amp;T Unix. As a result, the tar
command became much better known in universities and research groups that
used Version 7. The combination of the  and  utilities provided very precise
control over file selection. Unfortunately, the format has many limitations
that make it unsuitable for widespread use. Only the POSIX format permits
files over 4GB, and its 18-bit limit for most other fields makes it unsuitable
for modern systems. In addition, cpio formats only store numeric UID/GID
values (not usernames and group names), which can make it very difficult
to correctly transfer archives across systems with dissimilar user numbering.
 A  is a shell script that, when executed on a POSIX-compliant system, will
recreate a collection of file system objects. The libarchive library can
write two different kinds of shar archives:   The traditional shar format
uses a limited set of POSIX commands, including   and  It is suitable for
portably archiving small collections of plain text files. However, it is
not generally well-suited for large archives (many implementations of  have
limits on the size of a script) nor should it be used with non-text files.
 This format is similar to shar but encodes files using  so that the result
will be a plain text file regardless of the file contents. It also includes
additional shell commands that attempt to reproduce as many file attributes
as possible, including owner, mode, and flags. The additional commands used
to restore file attributes make shardump archives less portable than plain
shar archives.   Libarchive can read and extract from files containing ISO9660-compliant
CDROM images. It also has partial support for Rockridge extensions. In many
cases, this can remove the need to burn a physical CDROM. It also avoids
security and complexity issues that come with virtual mounts and loopback
devices.  Libarchive can extract from most zip format archives. It currently
only supports uncompressed entries and entries compressed with the  algorithm.
Older zip compression algorithms are not supported.  The Unix archive format
(commonly created by the  archiver) is a general-purpose format which is
used almost exclusively for object files to be read by the link editor
 The ar format has never been standardised. There are two common variants:
the GNU format derived from SVR4, and the BSD format, which first appeared
in 4.4BSD. Libarchive provides read and write support for both variants.
