TIFFWriteScanline - write a scanline to an
open <font size='-1'>TIFF</font>
 file 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</b> <p>
<b>int TIFFWriteScanline(TIFF *</b><i>tif</i><b>,
tdata_t </b><i>buf</i><b>, uint32 </b><i>row</i><b>, tsample_t </b><i>sample</i><b>)</b> 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
Write data to a file
at the specified row. The <i>sample</i> parameter is used only if data are organized
in separate planes (<i>PlanarConfiguration</i>=2). The data are assumed to be uncompressed
and in the native bit- and byte-order of the host machine. The data written
to the file is compressed according to the compression scheme of the current
<font size='-1'>TIFF</font>
 directory (see further below). If the current scanline is past the
end of the current subfile, the <i>ImageLength</i> field is automatically increased
to include the scanline (except for <i>PlanarConfiguration</i>=2, where the <i>ImageLength</i>
cannot be changed once the first data are written). If the <i>ImageLength</i> is
increased, the <i>StripOffsets</i> and <i>StripByteCounts</i> fields are similarly enlarged
to reflect data written past the previous end of image. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Notes</a></h2>
The library
writes encoded data using the native machine byte order. Correctly implemented
<font size='-1'>TIFF</font>
 readers are expected to do any necessary byte-swapping to correctly
process image data with BitsPerSample greater than 8. The library attempts
to hide bit-ordering differences between the image and the native machine
by converting data from the native machine order. <p>
In C++ the <i>sample</i> parameter
defaults to 0. <p>
Once data are written to a file for the current directory,
the values of certain tags may not be altered; see <a href='TIFFSetField.3TIFF.html'><i>TIFFSetField</i>(3TIFF)</a>

for more information. <p>
It is not possible to write scanlines to a file that
uses a tiled organization.  The routine <i>TIFFIsTiled</i> can be used to determine
if the file is organized as tiles or strips. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Return Values</a></h2>
<i>TIFFWriteScanline</i>
returns -1 if it immediately detects an error and 1 for a successful write.

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Diagnostics</a></h2>
All error messages are directed to the <a href='TIFFError.3TIFF.html'><i>TIFFError</i>(3TIFF)</a>
 routine.
<p>
<b>%s: File not open for writing .</b> The file was opened for reading, not writing.
<p>
<b>Can not write scanlines to a tiled image</b>. An attempt was made to write a
scanline to a tiled image. The image is assumed to be organized in tiles
because the <i>TileWidth</i> and <i>TileLength</i> tags have been set with <a href='TIFFSetField.3TIFF.html'><i>TIFFSetField</i>(3TIFF)</a>
.
<p>
<b>Compression algorithm does not support random access</b>. Data was written in
a non-sequential order to a file that uses a compression algorithm and that
has <i>RowsPerStrip</i> greater than one. That is, data in the image is to be stored
in a compressed form, and with multiple rows packed into a strip. In this
case, the library does not support random access to the data. The data should
either be written as entire strips, sequentially by rows, or the value
of <i>RowsPerStrip</i> should be set to one. <p>
<b>%s: Must set "ImageWidth" before writing
data</b>. The image&rsquo;s width has not be set before the first write. See <a href='TIFFSetField.3TIFF.html'><b>TIFFSetField</b>(3TIFF)</a>

for information on how to do this. <p>
<b>%s: Must set "PlanarConfiguration" before
writing data</b>. The organization of data has not be defined before the first
write. See <a href='TIFFSetField.3TIFF.html'><b>TIFFSetField</b>(3TIFF)</a>
 for information on how to do this. <p>
<b>Can not
change "ImageLength" when using separate planes</b>. Separate image planes are
being used (<i>PlanarConfiguration</i>=2), but the number of rows has not been
specified before the first write. The library supports the dynamic growth
of an image only when data are organized in a contiguous manner (<i>PlanarConfiguration</i>=1).
<p>
<b>%d: Sample out of range, max %d</b>. The <i>sample</i> parameter was greater than the
value of the SamplesPerPixel tag. <p>
<b>%s: No space for strip arrays .</b> There was
not enough space for the arrays that hold strip offsets and byte counts.

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Bugs</a></h2>
Writing subsampled YCbCR data does not work correctly because, for
 <i>PlanarConfiguration</i>=2 the size of a scanline is not calculated on a per-sample
basis, and for <i>PlanarConfiguration</i>=1 the library does not pack the block-interleaved
samples.
