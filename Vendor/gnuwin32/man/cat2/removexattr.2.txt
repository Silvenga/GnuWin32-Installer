REMOVEXATTR(2)            System calls           REMOVEXATTR(2)





NAME
       removexattr,  lremovexattr,  fremovexattr  -  remove  an
       extended attribute

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <attr/xattr.h>

       int removexattr (const char *path, const char *name);
       int lremovexattr (const char *path, const char *name);
       int fremovexattr (int filedes, const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
       Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with
       inodes  (files,  directories,  symlinks, etc).  They are
       extensions to the normal attributes which are associated
       with  all  inodes in the system (i.e. the stat(2) data).
       A complete overview of extended attributes concepts  can
       be found in attr(5).

       removexattr removes the extended attribute identified by
       name and associated with the given path in the  filesys-
       tem.

       lremovexattr  is identical to removexattr, except in the
       case of a symbolic link, where the extended attribute is
       removed  from  the  link  itself,  not  the file that it
       refers to.

       fremovexattr  is  identical  to  removexattr,  only  the
       extended attribute is removed from the open file pointed
       to by filedes (as returned by open(2)) in place of path.

       An  extended  attribute name is a simple NULL-terminated
       string.  The name includes a namespace  prefix  -  there
       may  be  several, disjoint namespaces associated with an
       individual inode.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero  is  returned.   On  failure,  -1  is
       returned and errno is set appropriately.

       If  the  named attribute does not exist, errno is set to
       ENOATTR.

       If extended attributes are not supported by the filesys-
       tem, or are disabled, errno is set to ENOTSUP.

       The  errors  documented  for the stat(2) system call are
       also applicable here.
