Moon data `%[FORMAT]?ARGUMENT' special texts
............................................

  `%[FORMAT]([*][MODE]ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE[,[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]'
references the approximate time of *moonrise* by default,
`%[FORMAT])[*][MODE]ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE[,[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]'
references the approximate time of *moonset* by default,
`%[FORMAT][[*][MODE]ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE[,[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]'
references the approximate period of *visibility* of the Moon (lunar
day length) by default,
`%[FORMAT]][*][MODE]ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE[,[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]'
references the approximate period of *non-visibility* of the Moon
(lunar night length) by default.

  All these special texts can be used for at pleasure any geographic
point location, i.e. it is possible to determine different astronomical
values for any location on the globe, and that for at pleasure any
clocktime with a resolution of a single minute within the period of the
years AD 1 until AD 9999, that is respected by Gcal.

  The selection which value has to be calculated by these special texts
is done by specifying the MODE part of the preceding argument.
Actually, exactly 61 different modes can be used that are represented
by the `0'...`9', `a'...`z' and `A'...`Y' characters, and which create
different kind of results that are depending on the special text used.
First of all, here is a table in which all usable modes are described
and explained sufficiently.  You can also see from this table, which
Moon oriented special text or texts are corresponding to which mode,
i.e. cause the determination of an astronomical value as it is
described in the table:

`0'     `(', `)'      Calculates the approximate midnight time of the
                      Moon.  The astronomical midnight time of the Moon
                      is at that clocktime, when the Moon holds an
                      "azimuth" (horizontal angular distance between the
                      vertical circle, that passes the Moon, and the
                      North point) of either precisely 0 degrees of
                      precisely 180 degrees, which depends on the season
                      and the geographical location.  At that clocktime,
                      the Moon is close its "lowest culmination point",
                      i.e. close the lowest point below or above the
                      horizontal plane the Moon transits during this day.
                      Nevertheless, there is exactly one day during a
                      "synodic month" (or lunation) --i.e. the mean time
                      between two consecutive "conjunctions" (or New Moon
                      phases)-- at which no lunar midnight happens,
                      because the Moon revolves the Earth within 24 hours
                      and 50 minutes on the average -- which also means,
                      that the Moon rises on the average 50 minutes later
                      each day.

`1'     `(', `)'      Calculates the approximate noon time of the Moon.
                      The astronomical noon time of the Moon is at that
                      clocktime, when the Moon holds an azimuth of either
                      precisely 180 degrees of precisely 0 degrees, which
                      depends on the season and the geographical location.
                      At that clocktime, the Moon is close its "highest
                      culmination point", i.e. close the highest point
                      above or below the horizontal plane the Moon
                      transits during this day.  Nevertheless, there is
                      exactly one day during a synodic month at which no
                      lunar noon happens.

`2'     `('           Calculates the approximate time when the center of
                      the Moon passes a reference altitude which is
                      between about 54 and 61 arcminutes above a
                      "mathematical-geocentric" horizon before lunar noon
                      time; thus rising.  A mathematical horizon is a
                      purely geometrically-built horizon which disregards
                      the phenomenon of refraction as it arises in
                      reality by the influence of the Earth's atmosphere.
                      A geocentrical horizon is the horizontal plane
                      that passes through the Earth's center, orthogonal
                      to the observer's local vertical.  In the further
                      context, the shorter term _mathematical horizon_ is
                      used which actually means the
                      mathematical-geocentric horizon.  The above
                      mentioned reference altitude is computed from the
                      value of the Moon's parallax as it appear at that
                      clocktime.  Nevertheless, there is exactly one day
                      during a synodic month at which no such moonrise
                      happens.

                      semidiameter and Moon's parallax as they appear at
                      that clocktime.  If the reference altitude that is
                      referring to the Moon's upper limb is converted to
                      a reference altitude that is referring to the
                      Moon's center, this results in a value which is
                      between about 39 and 44 arcminutes above the

                      Because the terrestrial globe flattens towards the
                      pole caps and therefore cannot be taken as an

                      (Latin term `magnitudo', abbreviated m) is used to
                      define the brightness of a star, and is a
                      non-metrical value.  The difference between two
                      consecutive magnitudes is 1 to 2.512.  Therefore, a
                      star with the brightness of 1m is 2.512 times
                      brighter than a star of 2m.  A negative magnitude
                      denotes a very bright star, for example almost -27m
                      for the Sun, whereas the hardly visible planet
                      Pluto has a magnitude of a bit more than +14m.  The

  If no MODE is given, Gcal automatically uses that mode, which is
enabled by the mode character `5'.  If a mode character is given that
is not according to one of the `0'...`9', `a'...`z' and `A'...`Y'
characters, Gcal also automatically uses that mode, which is enabled by
the mode character `5'.

  Depending on the selected mode, Gcal represents the Moon oriented
special texts using the same types and styles as they are used by the
Sun oriented special texts, these are analogously valid!  *Note
Representation of the Sun oriented special texts: x-Sun-representation,
for the detailed description of the different types of representation
used by the Sun oriented special texts, which are likewise valid for
the Moon oriented special texts.

  The following table informs you about which type of representation is
caused by a mode.  The previously defined numbering scheme, as it has
been used for the introduction of the types of representation, is used
as key value in the column that holds the type of representation.  The
table also contains a column that shows whether a mode enables
dynamical values, i.e. values that are depending on the respective
clocktime (if you use the `--time-offset=ARGUMENT' option, you can
change the respective clocktime that is used for calculating such
values).  In a next table column, it is listed whether the given
co-ordinate of the location influences the determination of a value,
and the last column of the table gives you the information whether a
given timezone value affects the values determination:

     is the 1st June 1998.

     The text `Moonset at %)*5+5158+00738,120  in MS, BRD' will be

     date is the 1st June 1998.

     The text `Moon non-visible %]*+5158+00738,120  in MS, BRD' will be
     expanded to
     ==> `Moon non-visible 10.469 in MS, BRD', in case the actual
     system date is the 1st June 1998.

     The text `Moon azimuth 0 o'clock=%(*a+5158+00738,120  in MS, BRD'
     will be expanded to
     ==> `Moon azimuth 0 o'clock=267d37' in MS, BRD', in case the
     actual system date is the 1st June 1998.

     The text `Moonphase %(x+00+000 =%(*m+5158+00738,120 % in MS, BRD'
     will be expanded to
     ==> `Moonphase +16h00'=45.248% in MS, BRD', in case you call Gcal
     with the `--time-offset=16:' option and the actual system date is
     the 1st June 1998.

     The text `Julian date at %(x+00+000 =%(y+00+000' will be expanded
     to
     ==> `Julian date at +10h15'=2450965.927', in case you call Gcal
     with the `--time-offset=10:15' option and the actual system date
     is the 1st June 1998.

  Here is a list that reports about the used reference systems in a
short manner, describes other aspects that are unmentioned now, and
informs about the lacks and limitations that are existing for the Moon
oriented special texts:

   * All astronomical calculations are based on methods that use
     --astronomically seen-- low-precision elements, which of course is
     shown in the precision of the results that are caused by them.
     Nevertheless in most cases, these results can be treated as more
     as sufficiently precise if one measures their practical use.

   * All azimuth and elevation values are always referring to the
     center of the respective astronomical object, except the case, it
     is stated otherwise.

   * The base point of azimuth values, right ascension values and other
     ecliptic co-ordinate values is always measured clockwise relative
     to the geographical, true North (not the magnetic North as shown
     by a compass), where angular values for the North direction are
     both denoted as 0 degree and 360 degree.

   * All topocentrically based azimuth and elevation values are always
     corrected by the amount of atmospheric refraction.  Such a kind of
     correction is always done if the center of the respective
     astronomical object is above 2 degrees below the horizon.

   * Generally, the rise and set times of the Moon cannot be precisely
     predicted, because depending on unpredictable atmospheric
     conditions, i.e. the local weather conditions as they appear
     during these times change the amount of atmospheric refraction at
     the horizon, so that the precalculated rise and set times may
     throughout be in error by a minute or more.

   * The accuracy of rise and set computations decreases again at high
     latitudes, i.e. within in the lunar Arctic Circle.  There, small
     variations in atmospheric refraction can change the time of
     moonrise or moonset by many minutes, since the Moon intersects the
     horizon at a very shallow angle.  For the same reason, at high
     latitudes, the effects of observer height and local topography are
     magnified and can substantially change the times of the phenomena
     actually observed, or even whether the phenomena are observed to
     occur at all.

   * It is possible that calculations, which are done for locations
     within the lunar Arctic Circle, sometimes result in the wrongly
     **.** text instead of the more precisely ++:++ or -:- texts that
     are used for marking special events.  Unfortunately, therefore,
     then the reason why the Moon does not rise or set is no longer
     clearly evident, respectively, it is possible to get the false
     suggestion that the reason for non-rising or non-setting of the
     Moon is caused by just the one day within a synodic month, at which
     the Moon does not rise or set anyhow.  Unfortunately, it is just
     only obvious *that* the Moon does not rise or set during this day.

*Please also note the following references:*

   * *Note Fixed dates option `--precise': x-precise, how to obtain a
     more precise representation of the values which are cause by these
     special texts.

   * And note *Note Calendar option `--time-offset=ARGUMENT':
     x-time-offset, how to change the clocktime, for which the
     dynamical, i.e. depending on the respective clocktime, Moon
     oriented special texts are calculated.

   * Likewise, see *Note Fixed dates option `--cycle-end=ARGUMENT':
     x-cycle-end, how the dynamical, i.e. depending on the respective
     clocktime, Moon oriented special texts are calculated for a series
     of clocktimes for the current day.

   * Furthermore, see *Note Fixed dates option
     `--adjust-value=ARGUMENT': x-adjust-value, how to change the
     reference altitude that is used to calculate the rise and set
     times.

   * And last, note *Note Fixed dates option
     `--atmosphere=AIR-PRESSURE[,TEMPERATURE]': x-atmosphere, how to
     change the base data of the atmosphere that affects the calculation
     of the Moon oriented special texts.

  All Moon oriented special texts *must* always be trailed by a
_whitespace_ character which is removed in output!
