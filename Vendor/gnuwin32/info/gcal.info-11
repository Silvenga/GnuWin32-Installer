* Table of Obsolete Date Formats::

  Because Gcal 3.01 is able to represent most special texts which may
occur in the text part of a resource file line (*note Description of
all `%?'... Special Texts: Special Texts.), and most of the format
elements as they may be used in the date format text of the
`--date-format' *Note Calendar option `--date-format=de|us|gb|TEXT':
x-date-format, by using a format instruction, some of them --mainly
introduced in the Gcal versions 2.20 and 2.40-- are obsolete now.  The
following complete tables of all these obsolete special texts
respectively format elements with their new representation, as used by
Gcal 3.01 now, show the changes made.

Format Instruction
******************

  Gcal 3.01 is able to represent text variables, special texts and date
formats especially in a very comfortable and uniform manner by using a
format instruction.

  Here comes the description of the format instruction components, now
called FORMAT in the further context.  In general, the template of a
format instruction is:

     ALIGNMENT [SIGN] [ZERO] WIDTH [STYLE] [SUFFIX] FORMAT

  If a FORMAT of above mentioned template is used, its components must
be specified in the above mentioned order, at which the definition of
the components embraced by `[ ]' is of course optional.  The single
components of the format instruction are assembled as follows:

*Character* *Description of the components*

            ALIGNMENT group (exactly one member must be defined):
`<'         Field contents is placed at the left margin of the field by
            using the width WIDTH
`:'         Field contents is placed in centered manner in the field by
            using the width WIDTH
`>'         Field contents is placed at the right margin of the field by
            using the width WIDTH

            SIGN (may be defined):
`+'         Numerical value is provided with leading sign

            ZERO (may be defined):
`0'         Numerical value is filled with leading zero(es)

            WIDTH (must be defined):
N           Field has the width N (actual range 1...256).

            STYLE group (exactly one member may be defined):
`u'         Field contents is converted to upper-case letters
`l'         Field contents is converted to lower-case letters
`w'         Field contents is converted to capitalized words

            SUFFIX (may be defined):
`&'         Numerical value is provided with an Ordinal Number suffix

            FORMAT group (exactly one member must be defined):
`*'         Field contents is not cut after position WIDTH
`#'         Field contents is cut after position WIDTH

  If a given WIDTH component is greater 256 but less than 999, a field
width of 256 is assumed.  But if a given WIDTH component is zero, this
interrupts the interpretation phase of Gcal so that the complete FORMAT
is not interpreted anymore and is therefore displayed respectively
assigned as is.  The same happens if a component is misspelled, given
in wrong order, or one of the required components is unspecified.

  Furthermore, a STYLE component may be specified case-independently.
*Note Calendar option `--translate-string=TEXT': x-translate-string,
for further annotations how the STYLE component is used correctly.

Coding Scheme
*************

* Menu:

* Coding Scheme Table 1::
* Coding Scheme Table 2::

  The following coding scheme tables explain the relations between the
_date part_ (YYYY...) of a resource file line and the modifiers, the
short-style option `-c|C[]' --which is used for enabling the fixed date
feature-- respectively the `--period-of-fixed-dates=ARGUMENT'
long-style option may have, i.e. they point out all possible
correspondences.  This is necessary because Gcal does not respect all
entries found in a resource file if a _fixed date_ argument is given,
it respects only those entries which have a definite relation to the
_fixed date_ argument to avoid the output of redundant information!
*Note Fixed dates option `--period-of-fixed-dates=ARGUMENT':
x-period-of-fixed-dates, for further details.

In the _date part_ YYYY...:

YYYY
     represents any year number (`0001...9999').

MM
     represents any month number (`01...12' or `99') respectively any
     textual short month name with length of 3 characters (`Jan',
     `Feb'...).

DD
     represents any day number (`01...28', `29', `30', `31' or `99').

WWW
     represents any textual short weekday name with length of 2...3
     characters (`Mon...Sun').

?
     represents any case-insensitive single letter.

N
     represents any positive integer number (one or more digits).

Environment Variables
*********************

Here is a table of all environment variables which are used by Gcal:

`GCAL'
`GCAL_OPT'
     Flags which are passed to the Gcal program automatically.

`GCAL_COLUMNS'
`COLUMNS'
     Sets the number of columns on the screen.  Takes precedence over
     the number of columns specified by the `TERM' environment variable
     or the system itself.

`GCAL_DATE_FORMAT'
     Contains the date format text which defines the ordering of a
     displayed date.  Takes precedence over the default date format
     text.

`GCAL_LINES'
`LINES'
     Sets the number of lines on the screen.  Takes precedence over the
     number of lines specified by the `TERM' environment variable or
     the system itself.

`GCAL_SYS_DATADIR'
     Name of a file directory absolute to the _root_/$PREFIX file
     directory, where the system-administrator stores common, _public
     access_ resource files (dates files).

`GCAL_USR_DATADIR'
     Name of a file directory relative to the `HOME' file directory,
     where the user stores personal, respectively _private access_
     resource files (dates files).  Takes precedence over
     `GCAL_SYS_DATADIR'.

`GCALANSI'
     If defined or set, ANSI escape highlighting sequences are used
     respectively substituted by default if no other highlighting
     sequences are defined by command line option or found in the
     Termcap library.

`GCALPATH'
     (`:') colon-separated list of file directories which are searched
     to find the `.gcalrc' file.  Takes precedence over `HOME',
     `GCAL_USR_DATADIR' and `GCAL_SYS_DATADIR'.

`GCALPROG'
     Contains the file name of the executable Gcal program that is used
     by the Tcal program to call the Gcal program.  Takes precedence
     over the file name `gcal' which is burned-in during the
     compilation step of the Tcal program.  The `GCALPROG' environment
     variable must always be set if the Gcal program is installed under
     another name than the standard name `gcal', otherwise Tcal is
     unable to execute the Gcal program automatically!

`HOME'
     Name of the user's home file directory.  This is used to find the
     `.gcalrc' file.  Takes precedence over `GCAL_USR_DATADIR' and
     `GCAL_SYS_DATADIR'.

`LANGUAGE'
     The national language and other cultural-specific conventions used
     by Gcal at run-time.  Takes precedence over `LC_ALL', `LC_MESSAGES'
     and `LANG'.

`LC_ALL'
     The national language and other cultural-specific conventions used
     by Gcal at run-time.  Takes precedence over `LC_MESSAGES' and
     `LANG'.

`LC_MESSAGES'
     The national language and other cultural-specific conventions used
     by Gcal at run-time.  Takes precedence over `LANG'.

`LANG'
     The national language and other cultural-specific conventions used
     by Gcal at run-time.

`LOGNAME'
     The eMail address which is used if the mailing option is wanted.
     *Note Global option `--mail[=ADDRESS]': x-mail, for more details.

`MAILPROG'
     Name of the mailer program which is used if the mailing option is
     wanted.  Takes precedence over the file name `mail' which is
     burned-in during the compilation step of the Gcal program.  *Note
     Global option `--mail[=ADDRESS]': x-mail, for more details.

`MAILTO'
     The eMail address which is used if the mailing option is wanted.
     Takes precedence over `USER' and `LOGNAME'.  *Note Global option
     `--mail[=ADDRESS]': x-mail, for more details.

`PAGER'
     Name of the _external pager_ program which is used if the paging
     option is wanted.  *Note Global option `--pager': x-pager, for
     more details.

`PATH'
     (`:') colon-separated list of file directories which are searched
     to find the _external pager_ program.  *Note Global option
     `--pager': x-pager, for more details.

`TERM'
     The type of terminal on which the Gcal program is being run.

`TXT2GCALPROG'
     Contains the file name of the executable Txt2gcal program that is
     used by the Gcal program to call the Txt2gcal program.  Takes
     precedence over the file name `txt2gcal' which is burned-in during
     the compilation step of the Gcal program.  The `TXT2GCALPROG'
     environment variable must always be set if the Txt2gcal program is
     installed under another name than the standard name `txt2gcal',
     otherwise Gcal is unable to execute the Txt2gcal program
     automatically!  *Note Text variables::, for further details.

`TZ'
     The timezone information which is added to the date text of sent
     eMails, created response files and created shell script files.

`USER'
