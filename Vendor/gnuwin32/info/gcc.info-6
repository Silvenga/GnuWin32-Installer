M680x0 Options
--------------

   These are the `-m' options defined for the 68000 series.  The default
values for these options depends on which style of 68000 was selected
when the compiler was configured; the defaults for the most common
choices are given below.

`-m68000'
`-mc68000'
     Generate output for a 68000.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68000-based systems.

     Use this option for microcontrollers with a 68000 or EC000 core,
     including the 68008, 68302, 68306, 68307, 68322, 68328 and 68356.

`-m68020'
`-mc68020'
     Generate output for a 68020.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68020-based systems.

`-m68881'
     Generate output containing 68881 instructions for floating point.
     This is the default for most 68020 systems unless `--nfp' was
     specified when the compiler was configured.

`-m68030'
     Generate output for a 68030.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68030-based systems.

`-m68040'
     Generate output for a 68040.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68040-based systems.

     This option inhibits the use of 68881/68882 instructions that have
     to be emulated by software on the 68040.  Use this option if your
     68040 does not have code to emulate those instructions.

`-m68060'
     Generate output for a 68060.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68060-based systems.

     This option inhibits the use of 68020 and 68881/68882 instructions
     that have to be emulated by software on the 68060.  Use this
     option if your 68060 does not have code to emulate those
     instructions.

`-mcpu32'
     Generate output for a CPU32. This is the default when the compiler
     is configured for CPU32-based systems.

     Use this option for microcontrollers with a CPU32 or CPU32+ core,
     including the 68330, 68331, 68332, 68333, 68334, 68336, 68340,
     68341, 68349 and 68360.

`-m5200'
     Generate output for a 520X "coldfire" family cpu.  This is the
     default when the compiler is configured for 520X-based systems.

     Use this option for microcontroller with a 5200 core, including
     the MCF5202, MCF5203, MCF5204 and MCF5202.

`-m68020-40'
     Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new
     instructions.  This results in code which can run relatively
     efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The
     generated code does use the 68881 instructions that are emulated
     on the 68040.

`-m68020-60'
     Generate output for a 68060, without using any of the new
     instructions.  This results in code which can run relatively
     efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The
     generated code does use the 68881 instructions that are emulated
     on the 68060.

`-mfpa'
     Generate output containing Sun FPA instructions for floating point.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all m68k
     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
     compiler are used, but this can't be done directly in
     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.  The embedded
     targets `m68k-*-aout' and `m68k-*-coff' do provide software
     floating point support.

`-mshort'
     Consider type `int' to be 16 bits wide, like `short int'.

`-mnobitfield'
     Do not use the bit-field instructions.  The `-m68000', `-mcpu32'
     and `-m5200' options imply `-mnobitfield'.

`-mbitfield'
     Do use the bit-field instructions.  The `-m68020' option implies
     `-mbitfield'.  This is the default if you use a configuration
     designed for a 68020.

`-mrtd'
     Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
     that take a fixed number of arguments return with the `rtd'
     instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
     saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
     the arguments there.

     This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally used
     on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
     compiled with the Unix compiler.

     Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
     take variable numbers of arguments (including `printf'); otherwise
     incorrect code will be generated for calls to those functions.

     In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
     function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
     harmlessly ignored.)

     The `rtd' instruction is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030,
     68040, 68060 and CPU32 processors, but not by the 68000 or 5200.

`-malign-int'
`-mno-align-int'
     Control whether GCC aligns `int', `long', `long long', `float',
     `double', and `long double' variables on a 32-bit boundary
     (`-malign-int') or a 16-bit boundary (`-mno-align-int').  Aligning
     variables on 32-bit boundaries produces code that runs somewhat
     faster on processors with 32-bit busses at the expense of more
     memory.

     *Warning:* if you use the `-malign-int' switch, GCC will align
     structures containing the above types  differently than most
     published application binary interface specifications for the m68k.

`-mpcrel'
     Use the pc-relative addressing mode of the 68000 directly, instead
     of using a global offset table.  At present, this option implies
     `-fpic', allowing at most a 16-bit offset for pc-relative
     addressing.  `-fPIC' is not presently supported with `-mpcrel',
     though this could be supported for 68020 and higher processors.

`-mno-strict-align'
`-mstrict-align'
     Do not (do) assume that unaligned memory references will be
     handled by the system.


File: gcc.info,  Node: M68hc1x Options,  Next: VAX Options,  Prev: M680x0 Options,  Up: Submodel Options

M68hc1x Options
---------------

   These are the `-m' options defined for the 68hc11 and 68hc12
microcontrollers.  The default values for these options depends on
which style of microcontroller was selected when the compiler was
configured; the defaults for the most common choices are given below.

`-m6811'
`-m68hc11'
     Generate output for a 68HC11.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68HC11-based systems.

`-m6812'
`-m68hc12'
     Generate output for a 68HC12.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68HC12-based systems.

`-mauto-incdec'
     Enable the use of 68HC12 pre and post auto-increment and
     auto-decrement addressing modes.

`-mshort'
     Consider type `int' to be 16 bits wide, like `short int'.

`-msoft-reg-count=COUNT'
     Specify the number of pseudo-soft registers which are used for the
     code generation.  The maximum number is 32.  Using more pseudo-soft
     register may or may not result in better code depending on the
     program.  The default is 4 for 68HC11 and 2 for 68HC12.


File: gcc.info,  Node: VAX Options,  Next: SPARC Options,  Prev: M68hc1x Options,  Up: Submodel Options

VAX Options
-----------

   These `-m' options are defined for the Vax:

`-munix'
     Do not output certain jump instructions (`aobleq' and so on) that
     the Unix assembler for the Vax cannot handle across long ranges.

`-mgnu'
     Do output those jump instructions, on the assumption that you will
     assemble with the GNU assembler.

`-mg'
     Output code for g-format floating point numbers instead of
     d-format.


File: gcc.info,  Node: SPARC Options,  Next: Convex Options,  Prev: VAX Options,  Up: Submodel Options

SPARC Options
-------------

   These `-m' switches are supported on the SPARC:

`-mno-app-regs'
`-mapp-regs'
     Specify `-mapp-regs' to generate output using the global registers
     2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications.
     This is the default.

     To be fully SVR4 ABI compliant at the cost of some performance
     loss, specify `-mno-app-regs'.  You should compile libraries and
     system software with this option.

`-mfpu'
`-mhard-float'
     Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is
     the default.

`-mno-fpu'
`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC
     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
     compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in
     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.  The embedded
     targets `sparc-*-aout' and `sparclite-*-*' do provide software
     floating point support.

     `-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
     therefore, it is only useful if you compile _all_ of a program with
     this option.  In particular, you need to compile `libgcc.a', the
     library that comes with GCC, with `-msoft-float' in order for this
     to work.

`-mhard-quad-float'
     Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating point
     instructions.

`-msoft-quad-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long
     double) floating point instructions.  The functions called are
     those specified in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.

     As of this writing, there are no sparc implementations that have
     hardware support for the quad-word floating point instructions.
     They all invoke a trap handler for one of these instructions, and
     then the trap handler emulates the effect of the instruction.
     Because of the trap handler overhead, this is much slower than
     calling the ABI library routines.  Thus the `-msoft-quad-float'
     option is the default.

`-mno-epilogue'
`-mepilogue'
     With `-mepilogue' (the default), the compiler always emits code for
     function exit at the end of each function.  Any function exit in
     the middle of the function (such as a return statement in C) will
     generate a jump to the exit code at the end of the function.

     With `-mno-epilogue', the compiler tries to emit exit code inline
     at every function exit.

`-mno-flat'
`-mflat'
     With `-mflat', the compiler does not generate save/restore
     instructions and will use a "flat" or single register window
     calling convention.  This model uses %i7 as the frame pointer and
     is compatible with the normal register window model.  Code from
     either may be intermixed.  The local registers and the input
     registers (0-5) are still treated as "call saved" registers and
     will be saved on the stack as necessary.

     With `-mno-flat' (the default), the compiler emits save/restore
     instructions (except for leaf functions) and is the normal mode of
     operation.

`-mno-unaligned-doubles'
`-munaligned-doubles'
     Assume that doubles have 8 byte alignment.  This is the default.

     With `-munaligned-doubles', GCC assumes that doubles have 8 byte
     alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they
     have an absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4 byte
     alignment.  Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility
     problems with code generated by other compilers.  It is not the
     default because it results in a performance loss, especially for
     floating point code.

`-mno-faster-structs'
`-mfaster-structs'
     With `-mfaster-structs', the compiler assumes that structures
     should have 8 byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
     `ldd' and `std' instructions for copies in structure assignment,
     in place of twice as many `ld' and `st' pairs.  However, the use
     of this changed alignment directly violates the Sparc ABI.  Thus,
     it's intended only for use on targets where the developer
     acknowledges that their resulting code will not be directly in
     line with the rules of the ABI.

`-mv8'
`-msparclite'
     These two options select variations on the SPARC architecture.

     By default (unless specifically configured for the Fujitsu
     SPARClite), GCC generates code for the v7 variant of the SPARC
     architecture.

     `-mv8' will give you SPARC v8 code.  The only difference from v7
     code is that the compiler emits the integer multiply and integer
     divide instructions which exist in SPARC v8 but not in SPARC v7.

     `-msparclite' will give you SPARClite code.  This adds the integer
     multiply, integer divide step and scan (`ffs') instructions which
     exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC v7.

     These options are deprecated and will be deleted in a future GCC
     release.  They have been replaced with `-mcpu=xxx'.

`-mcypress'
`-msupersparc'
     These two options select the processor for which the code is
     optimised.

     With `-mcypress' (the default), the compiler optimizes code for the
     Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the SparcStation/SparcServer 3xx
     series.  This is also appropriate for the older SparcStation 1, 2,
     IPX etc.

     With `-msupersparc' the compiler optimizes code for the SuperSparc
     cpu, as used in the SparcStation 10, 1000 and 2000 series. This
     flag also enables use of the full SPARC v8 instruction set.

     These options are deprecated and will be deleted in a future GCC
     release.  They have been replaced with `-mcpu=xxx'.

`-mcpu=CPU_TYPE'
     Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
     parameters for machine type CPU_TYPE.  Supported values for
     CPU_TYPE are `v7', `cypress', `v8', `supersparc', `sparclite',
     `hypersparc', `sparclite86x', `f930', `f934', `sparclet',
     `tsc701', `v9', and `ultrasparc'.

     Default instruction scheduling parameters are used for values that
     select an architecture and not an implementation.  These are `v7',
     `v8', `sparclite', `sparclet', `v9'.

     Here is a list of each supported architecture and their supported
     implementations.

              v7:             cypress
              v8:             supersparc, hypersparc
              sparclite:      f930, f934, sparclite86x
              sparclet:       tsc701
              v9:             ultrasparc

`-mtune=CPU_TYPE'
     Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
     CPU_TYPE, but do not set the instruction set or register set that
     the option `-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' would.

     The same values for `-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' are used for
     `-mtune=CPU_TYPE', though the only useful values are those that
     select a particular cpu implementation: `cypress', `supersparc',
     `hypersparc', `f930', `f934', `sparclite86x', `tsc701',
     `ultrasparc'.

   These `-m' switches are supported in addition to the above on the
SPARCLET processor.

`-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.

`-mlive-g0'
     Treat register `%g0' as a normal register.  GCC will continue to
     clobber it as necessary but will not assume it always reads as 0.

`-mbroken-saverestore'
     Generate code that does not use non-trivial forms of the `save' and
     `restore' instructions.  Early versions of the SPARCLET processor
     do not correctly handle `save' and `restore' instructions used with
     arguments.  They correctly handle them used without arguments.  A
     `save' instruction used without arguments increments the current
     window pointer but does not allocate a new stack frame.  It is
     assumed that the window overflow trap handler will properly handle
     this case as will interrupt handlers.

   These `-m' switches are supported in addition to the above on SPARC
V9 processors in 64-bit environments.

`-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.

`-m32'
`-m64'
     Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit
     environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits.  The 64-bit
     environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.

`-mcmodel=medlow'
     Generate code for the Medium/Low code model: the program must be
     linked in the low 32 bits of the address space.  Pointers are 64
     bits.  Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.

`-mcmodel=medmid'
     Generate code for the Medium/Middle code model: the program must
     be linked in the low 44 bits of the address space, the text
     segment must be less than 2G bytes, and data segment must be
     within 2G of the text segment.  Pointers are 64 bits.

`-mcmodel=medany'
     Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere code model: the program may
     be linked anywhere in the address space, the text segment must be
     less than 2G bytes, and data segment must be within 2G of the text
     segment.  Pointers are 64 bits.

`-mcmodel=embmedany'
     Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere code model for embedded
     systems: assume a 32-bit text and a 32-bit data segment, both
     starting anywhere (determined at link time).  Register %g4 points
     to the base of the data segment.  Pointers are still 64 bits.
     Programs are statically linked, PIC is not supported.

`-mstack-bias'
`-mno-stack-bias'
     With `-mstack-bias', GCC assumes that the stack pointer, and frame
     pointer if present, are offset by -2047 which must be added back
     when making stack frame references.  Otherwise, assume no such
     offset is present.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Convex Options,  Next: AMD29K Options,  Prev: SPARC Options,  Up: Submodel Options

Convex Options
--------------

   These `-m' options are defined for Convex:

`-mc1'
     Generate output for C1.  The code will run on any Convex machine.
     The preprocessor symbol `__convex__c1__' is defined.

`-mc2'
     Generate output for C2.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C2.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c2__' is defined.

`-mc32'
     Generate output for C32xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C32.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c32__' is defined.

`-mc34'
     Generate output for C34xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C34.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c34__' is defined.

`-mc38'
     Generate output for C38xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C38.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c38__' is defined.

`-margcount'
     Generate code which puts an argument count in the word preceding
     each argument list.  This is compatible with regular CC, and a few
     programs may need the argument count word.  GDB and other
     source-level debuggers do not need it; this info is in the symbol
     table.

`-mnoargcount'
     Omit the argument count word.  This is the default.

`-mvolatile-cache'
     Allow volatile references to be cached.  This is the default.

`-mvolatile-nocache'
     Volatile references bypass the data cache, going all the way to
     memory.  This is only needed for multi-processor code that does
     not use standard synchronization instructions.  Making
     non-volatile references to volatile locations will not necessarily
     work.

`-mlong32'
     Type long is 32 bits, the same as type int.  This is the default.

`-mlong64'
     Type long is 64 bits, the same as type long long.  This option is
     useless, because no library support exists for it.


File: gcc.info,  Node: AMD29K Options,  Next: ARM Options,  Prev: Convex Options,  Up: Submodel Options

AMD29K Options
--------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the AMD Am29000:

`-mdw'
     Generate code that assumes the `DW' bit is set, i.e., that byte and
     halfword operations are directly supported by the hardware.  This
     is the default.

`-mndw'
     Generate code that assumes the `DW' bit is not set.

`-mbw'
     Generate code that assumes the system supports byte and halfword
     write operations.  This is the default.

`-mnbw'
     Generate code that assumes the systems does not support byte and
     halfword write operations.  `-mnbw' implies `-mndw'.

`-msmall'
     Use a small memory model that assumes that all function addresses
     are either within a single 256 KB segment or at an absolute
     address of less than 256k.  This allows the `call' instruction to
     be used instead of a `const', `consth', `calli' sequence.

`-mnormal'
     Use the normal memory model: Generate `call' instructions only when
     calling functions in the same file and `calli' instructions
     otherwise.  This works if each file occupies less than 256 KB but
     allows the entire executable to be larger than 256 KB.  This is
     the default.

`-mlarge'
     Always use `calli' instructions.  Specify this option if you expect
     a single file to compile into more than 256 KB of code.

`-m29050'
     Generate code for the Am29050.

`-m29000'
     Generate code for the Am29000.  This is the default.

`-mkernel-registers'
     Generate references to registers `gr64-gr95' instead of to
     registers `gr96-gr127'.  This option can be used when compiling
     kernel code that wants a set of global registers disjoint from
     that used by user-mode code.

     Note that when this option is used, register names in `-f' flags
     must use the normal, user-mode, names.

`-muser-registers'
     Use the normal set of global registers, `gr96-gr127'.  This is the
     default.

`-mstack-check'
`-mno-stack-check'
     Insert (or do not insert) a call to `__msp_check' after each stack
     adjustment.  This is often used for kernel code.

`-mstorem-bug'
`-mno-storem-bug'
     `-mstorem-bug' handles 29k processors which cannot handle the
     separation of a mtsrim insn and a storem instruction (most 29000
     chips to date, but not the 29050).

`-mno-reuse-arg-regs'
`-mreuse-arg-regs'
     `-mno-reuse-arg-regs' tells the compiler to only use incoming
     argument registers for copying out arguments.  This helps detect
     calling a function with fewer arguments than it was declared with.

`-mno-impure-text'
`-mimpure-text'
     `-mimpure-text', used in addition to `-shared', tells the compiler
     to not pass `-assert pure-text' to the linker when linking a
     shared object.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not part of GCC.  Normally
     the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
     this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
     your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
     cross-compilation.

`-mno-multm'
     Do not generate multm or multmu instructions.  This is useful for
     some embedded systems which do not have trap handlers for these
     instructions.

ARM Options
-----------

   These `-m' options are defined for Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
architectures:

`-mapcs-frame'
     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure
     Call Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly
     necessary for correct execution of the code.  Specifying
     `-fomit-frame-pointer' with this option will cause the stack
     frames not to be generated for leaf functions.  The default is
     `-mno-apcs-frame'.

`-mapcs'
     This is a synonym for `-mapcs-frame'.

`-mapcs-26'
     Generate code for a processor running with a 26-bit program
     counter, and conforming to the function calling standards for the
     APCS 26-bit option.  This option replaces the `-m2' and `-m3'
     options of previous releases of the compiler.

`-mapcs-32'
     Generate code for a processor running with a 32-bit program
     counter, and conforming to the function calling standards for the
     APCS 32-bit option.  This option replaces the `-m6' option of
     previous releases of the compiler.

`-mthumb-interwork'
     Generate code which supports calling between the ARM and Thumb
     instruction sets.  Without this option the two instruction sets
     cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The default is
     `-mno-thumb-interwork', since slightly larger code is generated
     when `-mthumb-interwork' is specified.

`-mno-sched-prolog'
     Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prolog, or
     the merging of those instruction with the instructions in the
     function's body.  This means that all functions will start with a
     recognizable set of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from
     a small set of different function prologues), and this information
     can be used to locate the start if functions inside an executable
     piece of code.  The default is `-msched-prolog'.

`-mhard-float'
     Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is
     the default.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all ARM
     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
     compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in
     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.

     `-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
     therefore, it is only useful if you compile _all_ of a program with
     this option.  In particular, you need to compile `libgcc.a', the
     library that comes with GCC, with `-msoft-float' in order for this
     to work.

`-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This
     is the default for all standard configurations.

`-mbig-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the
     default is to compile code for a little-endian processor.

`-mwords-little-endian'
     This option only applies when generating code for big-endian
     processors.  Generate code for a little-endian word order but a
     big-endian byte order.  That is, a byte order of the form
     `32107654'.  Note: this option should only be used if you require
     compatibility with code for big-endian ARM processors generated by
     versions of the compiler prior to 2.8.

`-malignment-traps'
     Generate code that will not trap if the MMU has alignment traps
     enabled.  On ARM architectures prior to ARMv4, there were no
     instructions to access half-word objects stored in memory.
     However, when reading from memory a feature of the ARM
     architecture allows a word load to be used, even if the address is
     unaligned, and the processor core will rotate the data as it is
     being loaded.  This option tells the compiler that such misaligned
     accesses will cause a MMU trap and that it should instead
     synthesise the access as a series of byte accesses.  The compiler
     can still use word accesses to load half-word data if it knows
     that the address is aligned to a word boundary.

     This option is ignored when compiling for ARM architecture 4 or
     later, since these processors have instructions to directly access
     half-word objects in memory.

`-mno-alignment-traps'
     Generate code that assumes that the MMU will not trap unaligned
     accesses.  This produces better code when the target instruction
     set does not have half-word memory operations (i.e.
     implementations prior to ARMv4).

     Note that you cannot use this option to access unaligned word
     objects, since the processor will only fetch one 32-bit aligned
     object from memory.

     The default setting for most targets is `-mno-alignment-traps',
     since this produces better code when there are no half-word memory
     instructions available.

`-mshort-load-bytes'
`-mno-short-load-words'
     These are deprecated aliases for `-malignment-traps'.

`-mno-short-load-bytes'
`-mshort-load-words'
     This are deprecated aliases for `-mno-alignment-traps'.

`-mbsd'
     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Emulate the native BSD-mode
     compiler.  This is the default if `-ansi' is not specified.

`-mxopen'
     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Emulate the native
     X/Open-mode compiler.

`-mno-symrename'
     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Do not run the assembler
     post-processor, `symrename', after code has been assembled.
     Normally it is necessary to modify some of the standard symbols in
     preparation for linking with the RISC iX C library; this option
     suppresses this pass.  The post-processor is never run when the
     compiler is built for cross-compilation.

`-mcpu=NAME'
     This specifies the name of the target ARM processor.  GCC uses
     this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
     generating assembly code.  Permissible names are: arm2, arm250,
     arm3, arm6, arm60, arm600, arm610, arm620, arm7, arm7m, arm7d,
     arm7dm, arm7di, arm7dmi, arm70, arm700, arm700i, arm710, arm710c,
     arm7100, arm7500, arm7500fe, arm7tdmi, arm8, strongarm,
     strongarm110, strongarm1100, arm8, arm810, arm9, arm9e, arm920,
     arm920t, arm940t, arm9tdmi, arm10tdmi, arm1020t, xscale.

`-mtune=NAME'
     This option is very similar to the `-mcpu=' option, except that
     instead of specifying the actual target processor type, and hence
     restricting which instructions can be used, it specifies that GCC
     should tune the performance of the code as if the target were of
     the type specified in this option, but still choosing the
     instructions that it will generate based on the cpu specified by a
     `-mcpu=' option.  For some ARM implementations better performance
     can be obtained by using this option.

`-march=NAME'
     This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC uses
     this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
     generating assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction
     with or instead of the `-mcpu=' option.  Permissible names are:
     armv2, armv2a, armv3, armv3m, armv4, armv4t, armv5, armv5t,
     armv5te.

`-mfpe=NUMBER'
`-mfp=NUMBER'
     This specifies the version of the floating point emulation
     available on the target.  Permissible values are 2 and 3.  `-mfp='
     is a synonym for `-mfpe=', for compatibility with older versions
     of GCC.

`-mstructure-size-boundary=N'
     The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to a
     multiple of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible
     values are 8 and 32.  The default value varies for different
     toolchains.  For the COFF targeted toolchain the default value is
     8.  Specifying the larger number can produce faster, more
     efficient code, but can also increase the size of the program.
     The two values are potentially incompatible.  Code compiled with
     one value cannot necessarily expect to work with code or libraries
     compiled with the other value, if they exchange information using
     structures or unions.

`-mabort-on-noreturn'
     Generate a call to the function `abort' at the end of a `noreturn'
     function.  It will be executed if the function tries to return.

`-mlong-calls'
`-mno-long-calls'
     Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
     address of the function into a register and then performing a
     subroutine call on this register.  This switch is needed if the
     target function will lie outside of the 64 megabyte addressing
     range of the offset based version of subroutine call instruction.

     Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls will be
     turned into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions,
     functions which have the `short-call' attribute, functions that
     are inside the scope of a `#pragma no_long_calls' directive and
     functions whose definitions have already been compiled within the
     current compilation unit, will not be turned into long calls.  The
     exception to this rule is that weak function definitions,
     functions with the `long-call' attribute or the `section'
     attribute, and functions that are within the scope of a `#pragma
     long_calls' directive, will always be turned into long calls.

     This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
     `-mno-long-calls' will restore the default behaviour, as will
     placing the function calls within the scope of a `#pragma
     long_calls_off' directive.  Note these switches have no effect on
     how the compiler generates code to handle function calls via
     function pointers.

`-mnop-fun-dllimport'
     Disable support for the _dllimport_ attribute.

`-msingle-pic-base'
     Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather
     than loading it in the prologue for each function.  The run-time
     system is responsible for initialising this register with an
     appropriate value before execution begins.

`-mpic-register=REG'
     Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing.  The default
     is R10 unless stack-checking is enabled, when R9 is used.

`-mpoke-function-name'
     Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
     preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to
     this:

               t0
                   .ascii "arm_poke_function_name", 0
                   .align
               t1
                   .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
               arm_poke_function_name
                   mov     ip, sp
                   stmfd   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
                   sub     fp, ip, #4

     When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
     `pc' stored at `fp + 0'.  If the trace function then looks at
     location `pc - 12' and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
     there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this
     location and has length `((pc[-3]) & 0xff000000)'.

`-mthumb'
     Generate code for the 16-bit Thumb instruction set.  The default
     is to use the 32-bit ARM instruction set.

`-mtpcs-frame'
     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure
     Call Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one
     that does not call any other functions.)  The default is
     `-mno-tpcs-frame'.

`-mtpcs-leaf-frame'
     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure
     Call Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one
     that does not call any other functions.)  The default is
     `-mno-apcs-leaf-frame'.

`-mcallee-super-interworking'
     Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled
     an ARM instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before
     executing the rest of the function.  This allows these functions
     to be called from non-interworking code.

`-mcaller-super-interworking'
     Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
     execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
     compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in
     the cost of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.

MN10200 Options
---------------

   These `-m' options are defined for Matsushita MN10200 architectures:
`-mrelax'
     Indicate to the linker that it should perform a relaxation
     optimization pass to shorten branches, calls and absolute memory
     addresses.  This option only has an effect when used on the
     command line for the final link step.

     This option makes symbolic debugging impossible.

MN10300 Options
---------------

   These `-m' options are defined for Matsushita MN10300 architectures:

`-mmult-bug'
     Generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply instructions for the
     MN10300 processors.  This is the default.

`-mno-mult-bug'
     Do not generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply instructions
     for the MN10300 processors.

`-mam33'
     Generate code which uses features specific to the AM33 processor.

`-mno-am33'
     Do not generate code which uses features specific to the AM33
     processor.  This is the default.

`-mno-crt0'
     Do not link in the C run-time initialization object file.

`-mrelax'
     Indicate to the linker that it should perform a relaxation
     optimization pass to shorten branches, calls and absolute memory
     addresses.  This option only has an effect when used on the
     command line for the final link step.

M32R/D Options
--------------

   These `-m' options are defined for Mitsubishi M32R/D architectures:

`-mcode-model=small'
     Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
     addresses can be loaded with the `ld24' instruction), and assume
     all subroutines are reachable with the `bl' instruction.  This is
     the default.

     The addressability of a particular object can be set with the
     `model' attribute.

`-mcode-model=medium'
     Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
     compiler will generate `seth/add3' instructions to load their
     addresses), and assume all subroutines are reachable with the `bl'
     instruction.

`-mcode-model=large'
     Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
     compiler will generate `seth/add3' instructions to load their
     addresses), and assume subroutines may not be reachable with the
     `bl' instruction (the compiler will generate the much slower
     `seth/add3/jl' instruction sequence).

`-msdata=none'
     Disable use of the small data area.  Variables will be put into
     one of `.data', `bss', or `.rodata' (unless the `section'
     attribute has been specified).  This is the default.

     The small data area consists of sections `.sdata' and `.sbss'.
     Objects may be explicitly put in the small data area with the
     `section' attribute using one of these sections.

`-msdata=sdata'
     Put small global and static data in the small data area, but do not
     generate special code to reference them.

`-msdata=use'
     Put small global and static data in the small data area, and
     generate special instructions to reference them.

`-G NUM'
     Put global and static objects less than or equal to NUM bytes into
     the small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
     sections.  The default value of NUM is 8.  The `-msdata' option
     must be set to one of `sdata' or `use' for this option to have any
     effect.

     All modules should be compiled with the same `-G NUM' value.
     Compiling with different values of NUM may or may not work; if it
     doesn't the linker will give an error message--incorrect code will
     not be generated.


File: gcc.info,  Node: M88K Options,  Next: RS/6000 and PowerPC Options,  Prev: M32R/D Options,  Up: Submodel Options

M88K Options
------------

   These `-m' options are defined for Motorola 88k architectures:

`-m88000'
     Generate code that works well on both the m88100 and the m88110.

`-m88100'
     Generate code that works best for the m88100, but that also runs
     on the m88110.

`-m88110'
     Generate code that works best for the m88110, and may not run on
     the m88100.

`-mbig-pic'
     Obsolete option to be removed from the next revision.  Use `-fPIC'.

`-midentify-revision'
     Include an `ident' directive in the assembler output recording the
     source file name, compiler name and version, timestamp, and
     compilation flags used.

`-mno-underscores'
     In assembler output, emit symbol names without adding an underscore
     character at the beginning of each name.  The default is to use an
     underscore as prefix on each name.

`-mocs-debug-info'
`-mno-ocs-debug-info'
     Include (or omit) additional debugging information (about
     registers used in each stack frame) as specified in the 88open
     Object Compatibility Standard, "OCS".  This extra information
     allows debugging of code that has had the frame pointer
     eliminated.  The default for DG/UX, SVr4, and Delta 88 SVr3.2 is
     to include this information; other 88k configurations omit this
     information by default.

`-mocs-frame-position'
     When emitting COFF debugging information for automatic variables
     and parameters stored on the stack, use the offset from the
     canonical frame address, which is the stack pointer (register 31)
     on entry to the function.  The DG/UX, SVr4, Delta88 SVr3.2, and
     BCS configurations use `-mocs-frame-position'; other 88k
     configurations have the default `-mno-ocs-frame-position'.

`-mno-ocs-frame-position'
     When emitting COFF debugging information for automatic variables
     and parameters stored on the stack, use the offset from the frame
     pointer register (register 30).  When this option is in effect,
     the frame pointer is not eliminated when debugging information is
     selected by the -g switch.

`-moptimize-arg-area'
`-mno-optimize-arg-area'
     Control how function arguments are stored in stack frames.
     `-moptimize-arg-area' saves space by optimizing them, but this
     conflicts with the 88open specifications.  The opposite
     alternative, `-mno-optimize-arg-area', agrees with 88open
     standards.  By default GCC does not optimize the argument area.

`-mshort-data-NUM'
     Generate smaller data references by making them relative to `r0',
     which allows loading a value using a single instruction (rather
     than the usual two).  You control which data references are
     affected by specifying NUM with this option.  For example, if you
     specify `-mshort-data-512', then the data references affected are
     those involving displacements of less than 512 bytes.
     `-mshort-data-NUM' is not effective for NUM greater than 64k.

`-mserialize-volatile'
`-mno-serialize-volatile'
     Do, or don't, generate code to guarantee sequential consistency of
     volatile memory references.  By default, consistency is guaranteed.

     The order of memory references made by the MC88110 processor does
     not always match the order of the instructions requesting those
     references.  In particular, a load instruction may execute before
     a preceding store instruction.  Such reordering violates
     sequential consistency of volatile memory references, when there
     are multiple processors.   When consistency must be guaranteed,
     GNU C generates special instructions, as needed, to force
     execution in the proper order.

     The MC88100 processor does not reorder memory references and so
     always provides sequential consistency.  However, by default, GNU
     C generates the special instructions to guarantee consistency even
     when you use `-m88100', so that the code may be run on an MC88110
     processor.  If you intend to run your code only on the MC88100
     processor, you may use `-mno-serialize-volatile'.

     The extra code generated to guarantee consistency may affect the
     performance of your application.  If you know that you can safely
     forgo this guarantee, you may use `-mno-serialize-volatile'.

`-msvr4'
`-msvr3'
     Turn on (`-msvr4') or off (`-msvr3') compiler extensions related
     to System V release 4 (SVr4).  This controls the following:

       1. Which variant of the assembler syntax to emit.

       2. `-msvr4' makes the C preprocessor recognize `#pragma weak'
          that is used on System V release 4.

       3. `-msvr4' makes GCC issue additional declaration directives
          used in SVr4.

     `-msvr4' is the default for the m88k-motorola-sysv4 and
     m88k-dg-dgux m88k configurations. `-msvr3' is the default for all
     other m88k configurations.

`-mversion-03.00'
     This option is obsolete, and is ignored.

`-mno-check-zero-division'
`-mcheck-zero-division'
     Do, or don't, generate code to guarantee that integer division by
     zero will be detected.  By default, detection is guaranteed.

     Some models of the MC88100 processor fail to trap upon integer
     division by zero under certain conditions.  By default, when
     compiling code that might be run on such a processor, GNU C
     generates code that explicitly checks for zero-valued divisors and
     traps with exception number 503 when one is detected.  Use of
     mno-check-zero-division suppresses such checking for code
     generated to run on an MC88100 processor.

     GNU C assumes that the MC88110 processor correctly detects all
     instances of integer division by zero.  When `-m88110' is
     specified, both `-mcheck-zero-division' and
     `-mno-check-zero-division' are ignored, and no explicit checks for
     zero-valued divisors are generated.

`-muse-div-instruction'
     Use the div instruction for signed integer division on the MC88100
     processor.  By default, the div instruction is not used.

     On the MC88100 processor the signed integer division instruction
     div) traps to the operating system on a negative operand.  The
     operating system transparently completes the operation, but at a
     large cost in execution time.  By default, when compiling code
     that might be run on an MC88100 processor, GNU C emulates signed
     integer division using the unsigned integer division instruction
     divu), thereby avoiding the large penalty of a trap to the
     operating system.  Such emulation has its own, smaller, execution
     cost in both time and space.  To the extent that your code's
     important signed integer division operations are performed on two
     nonnegative operands, it may be desirable to use the div
     instruction directly.

     On the MC88110 processor the div instruction (also known as the
     divs instruction) processes negative operands without trapping to
     the operating system.  When `-m88110' is specified,
     `-muse-div-instruction' is ignored, and the div instruction is used
     for signed integer division.

     Note that the result of dividing `INT_MIN' by -1 is undefined.  In
     particular, the behavior of such a division with and without
     `-muse-div-instruction' may differ.

`-mtrap-large-shift'
`-mhandle-large-shift'
     Include code to detect bit-shifts of more than 31 bits;
     respectively, trap such shifts or emit code to handle them
     properly.  By default GCC makes no special provision for large bit
     shifts.

`-mwarn-passed-structs'
     Warn when a function passes a struct as an argument or result.
     Structure-passing conventions have changed during the evolution of
     the C language, and are often the source of portability problems.
     By default, GCC issues no such warning.
