DES Encryption and Password Handling
************************************

   On many systems, it is unnecessary to have any kind of user
authentication; for instance, a workstation which is not connected to a
network probably does not need any user authentication, because to use
the machine an intruder must have physical access.

   Sometimes, however, it is necessary to be sure that a user is
authorised to use some service a machine provides--for instance, to log
in as a particular user id (*note Users and Groups::).  One traditional
way of doing this is for each user to choose a secret "password"; then,
the system can ask someone claiming to be a user what the user's
password is, and if the person gives the correct password then the
system can grant the appropriate privileges.

   If all the passwords are just stored in a file somewhere, then this
file has to be very carefully protected.  To avoid this, passwords are
run through a "one-way function", a function which makes it difficult to
work out what its input was by looking at its output, before storing in
the file.

   The GNU C library already provides a one-way function based on MD5
and for compatibility with Unix systems the standard one-way function
based on the Data Encryption Standard.

   It also provides support for Secure RPC, and some library functions
that can be used to perform normal DES encryption.

Legal Problems
==============

   Because of the continuously changing state of the law, it's not
possible to provide a definitive survey of the laws affecting
cryptography.  Instead, this section warns you of some of the known
trouble spots; this may help you when you try to find out what the laws
of your country are.

   Some countries require that you have a licence to use, posess, or
import cryptography.  These countries are believed to include
Byelorussia, Burma, India, Indonesia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Pakistan,
Russia, and Saudi Arabia.

   Some countries restrict the transmission of encrypted messages by
radio; some telecommunications carriers restrict the transmission of
encrypted messages over their network.

   Many countries have some form of export control for encryption
software.  The Wassenaar Arrangement is a multilateral agreement
between 33 countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria,
Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the
Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States) which
restricts some kinds of encryption exports.  Different countries apply
the arrangement in different ways; some do not allow the exception for
certain kinds of "public domain" software (which would include this
library), some only restrict the export of software in tangible form,
and others impose significant additional restrictions.

   The United States has additional rules.  This software would
generally be exportable under 15 CFR 740.13(e), which permits exports of
"encryption source code" which is "publicly available" and which is
"not subject to an express agreement for the payment of a licensing fee
or royalty for commercial production or sale of any product developed
with the source code" to most countries.

   The rules in this area are continuously changing.  If you know of any
information in this manual that is out-of-date, please report it using
the `glibcbug' script. *Note Reporting Bugs::.

Reading Passwords
=================

   When reading in a password, it is desirable to avoid displaying it on
the screen, to help keep it secret.  The following function handles this
in a convenient way.

 - Functie: char * getpass (const char *PROMPT)
     `getpass' outputs PROMPT, then reads a string in from the terminal
     without echoing it.  It tries to connect to the real terminal,
     `/dev/tty', if possible, to encourage users not to put plaintext
     passwords in files; otherwise, it uses `stdin' and `stderr'.
     `getpass' also disables the INTR, QUIT, and SUSP characters on the
     terminal using the `ISIG' terminal attribute (*note Local Modes::).
     The terminal is flushed before and after `getpass', so that
     characters of a mistyped password are not accidentally visible.

     In other C libraries, `getpass' may only return the first
     `PASS_MAX' bytes of a password.  The GNU C library has no limit, so
     `PASS_MAX' is undefined.

     The prototype for this function is in `unistd.h'.  `PASS_MAX'
     would be defined in `limits.h'.

   This precise set of operations may not suit all possible situations.
In this case, it is recommended that users write their own `getpass'
substitute.  For instance, a very simple substitute is as follows:

     #include <termios.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     
     ssize_t
     my_getpass (char **lineptr, size_t *n, FILE *stream)
     {
       struct termios old, new;
       int nread;
     
       /* Turn echoing off and fail if we can't. */
       if (tcgetattr (fileno (stream), &old) != 0)
         return -1;
       new = old;
       new.c_lflag &= ~ECHO;
       if (tcsetattr (fileno (stream), TCSAFLUSH, &new) != 0)
         return -1;
     
       /* Read the password. */
       nread = getline (lineptr, n, stream);
     
       /* Restore terminal. */
       (void) tcsetattr (fileno (stream), TCSAFLUSH, &old);
     
       return nread;
     }

   The substitute takes the same parameters as `getline' (*note Line
Input::); the user must print any prompt desired.

Encrypting Passwords
====================

 - Functie: char * crypt (const char *KEY, const char *SALT)
     The `crypt' function takes a password, KEY, as a string, and a
     SALT character array which is described below, and returns a
     printable ASCII string which starts with another salt.  It is
     believed that, given the output of the function, the best way to
     find a KEY that will produce that output is to guess values of KEY
     until the original value of KEY is found.

     The SALT parameter does two things.  Firstly, it selects which
     algorithm is used, the MD5-based one or the DES-based one.
     Secondly, it makes life harder for someone trying to guess
     passwords against a file containing many passwords; without a
     SALT, an intruder can make a guess, run `crypt' on it once, and
     compare the result with all the passwords.  With a SALT, the
     intruder must run `crypt' once for each different salt.

     For the MD5-based algorithm, the SALT should consist of the string
     `$1$', followed by up to 8 characters, terminated by either
     another `$' or the end of the string.  The result of `crypt' will
     be the SALT, followed by a `$' if the salt didn't end with one,
     followed by 22 characters from the alphabet `./0-9A-Za-z', up to
     34 characters total.  Every character in the KEY is significant.

     For the DES-based algorithm, the SALT should consist of two
     characters from the alphabet `./0-9A-Za-z', and the result of
     `crypt' will be those two characters followed by 11 more from the
     same alphabet, 13 in total.  Only the first 8 characters in the
     KEY are significant.

     The MD5-based algorithm has no limit on the useful length of the
     password used, and is slightly more secure.  It is therefore
     preferred over the DES-based algorithm.

     When the user enters their password for the first time, the SALT
     should be set to a new string which is reasonably random.  To
     verify a password against the result of a previous call to
     `crypt', pass the result of the previous call as the SALT.

   The following short program is an example of how to use `crypt' the
first time a password is entered.  Note that the SALT generation is
just barely acceptable; in particular, it is not unique between
machines, and in many applications it would not be acceptable to let an
attacker know what time the user's password was last set.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <time.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <crypt.h>
     
     int
     main(void)
     {
       unsigned long seed[2];
       char salt[] = "$1$........";
       const char *const seedchars =
         "./0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST"
         "UVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
       char *password;
       int i;
     
       /* Generate a (not very) random seed.
          You should do it better than this... */
       seed[0] = time(NULL);
       seed[1] = getpid() ^ (seed[0] >> 14 & 0x30000);
     
       /* Turn it into printable characters from `seedchars'. */
       for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)
         salt[3+i] = seedchars[(seed[i/5] >> (i%5)*6) & 0x3f];
     
       /* Read in the user's password and encrypt it. */
       password = crypt(getpass("Password:"), salt);
     
       /* Print the results. */
       puts(password);
       return 0;
     }

   The next program shows how to verify a password.  It prompts the user
for a password and prints "Access granted." if the user types `GNU libc
manual'.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <string.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <crypt.h>
     
     int
     main(void)
     {
       /* Hashed form of "GNU libc manual". */
       const char *const pass = "$1$/iSaq7rB$EoUw5jJPPvAPECNaaWzMK/";
     
       char *result;
       int ok;
     
       /* Read in the user's password and encrypt it,
          passing the expected password in as the salt. */
       result = crypt(getpass("Password:"), pass);
     
       /* Test the result. */
       ok = strcmp (result, pass) == 0;
     
       puts(ok ? "Access granted." : "Access denied.");
       return ok ? 0 : 1;
     }

 - Functie: char * crypt_r (const char *KEY, const char *SALT, struct
          crypt_data * DATA)
     The `crypt_r' function does the same thing as `crypt', but takes
     an extra parameter which includes space for its result (among
     other things), so it can be reentrant.  `data->initialized' must be
     cleared to zero before the first time `crypt_r' is called.

     The `crypt_r' function is a GNU extension.

   The `crypt' and `crypt_r' functions are prototyped in the header
`crypt.h'.

DES Encryption
==============

   The Data Encryption Standard is described in the US Government
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 46-3 published by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology.  The DES has been very
thoroughly analysed since it was developed in the late 1970s, and no new
significant flaws have been found.

   However, the DES uses only a 56-bit key (plus 8 parity bits), and a
machine has been built in 1998 which can search through all possible
keys in about 6 days, which cost about US$200000; faster searches would
be possible with more money.  This makes simple DES unsecure for most
purposes, and NIST no longer permits new US government systems to use
simple DES.

   For serious encryption functionality, it is recommended that one of
the many free encryption libraries be used instead of these routines.

   The DES is a reversible operation which takes a 64-bit block and a
64-bit key, and produces another 64-bit block.  Usually the bits are
numbered so that the most-significant bit, the first bit, of each block
is numbered 1.

   Under that numbering, every 8th bit of the key (the 8th, 16th, and so
on) is not used by the encryption algorithm itself.  But the key must
have odd parity; that is, out of bits 1 through 8, and 9 through 16, and
so on, there must be an odd number of `1' bits, and this completely
specifies the unused bits.

 - Functie: void setkey (const char *KEY)
     The `setkey' function sets an internal data structure to be an
     expanded form of KEY.  KEY is specified as an array of 64 bits
     each stored in a `char', the first bit is `key[0]' and the 64th
     bit is `key[63]'.  The KEY should have the correct parity.

 - Functie: void encrypt (char *BLOCK, int EDFLAG)
     The `encrypt' function encrypts BLOCK if EDFLAG is 0, otherwise it
     decrypts BLOCK, using a key previously set by `setkey'.  The
     result is placed in BLOCK.

     Like `setkey', BLOCK is specified as an array of 64 bits each
     stored in a `char', but there are no parity bits in BLOCK.

 - Functie: void setkey_r (const char *KEY, struct crypt_data * DATA)
 - Functie: void encrypt_r (char *BLOCK, int EDFLAG, struct crypt_data
          * DATA)
     These are reentrant versions of `setkey' and `encrypt'.  The only
     difference is the extra parameter, which stores the expanded
     version of KEY.  Before calling `setkey_r' the first time,
     `data->initialised' must be cleared to zero.

   The `setkey_r' and `encrypt_r' functions are GNU extensions.
`setkey', `encrypt', `setkey_r', and `encrypt_r' are defined in
`crypt.h'.

 - Functie: int ecb_crypt (char *KEY, char *BLOCKS, unsigned LEN,
          unsigned MODE)
     The function `ecb_crypt' encrypts or decrypts one or more blocks
     using DES.  Each block is encrypted independently.

     The BLOCKS and the KEY are stored packed in 8-bit bytes, so that
     the first bit of the key is the most-significant bit of `key[0]'
     and the 63rd bit of the key is stored as the least-significant bit
     of `key[7]'.  The KEY should have the correct parity.

     LEN is the number of bytes in BLOCKS.  It should be a multiple of
     8 (so that there is a whole number of blocks to encrypt).  LEN is
     limited to a maximum of `DES_MAXDATA' bytes.

     The result of the encryption replaces the input in BLOCKS.

     The MODE parameter is the bitwise OR of two of the following:

    `DES_ENCRYPT'
          This constant, used in the MODE parameter, specifies that
          BLOCKS is to be encrypted.

    `DES_DECRYPT'
          This constant, used in the MODE parameter, specifies that
          BLOCKS is to be decrypted.

    `DES_HW'
          This constant, used in the MODE parameter, asks to use a
          hardware device.  If no hardware device is available,
          encryption happens anyway, but in software.

    `DES_SW'
          This constant, used in the MODE parameter, specifies that no
          hardware device is to be used.

     The result of the function will be one of these values:

    `DESERR_NONE'
          The encryption succeeded.

    `DESERR_NOHWDEVICE'
          The encryption succeeded, but there was no hardware device
          available.

    `DESERR_HWERROR'
          The encryption failed because of a hardware problem.

    `DESERR_BADPARAM'
          The encryption failed because of a bad parameter, for
          instance LEN is not a multiple of 8 or LEN is larger than
          `DES_MAXDATA'.

 - Functie: int DES_FAILED (int ERR)
     This macro returns 1 if ERR is a `success' result code from
     `ecb_crypt' or `cbc_crypt', and 0 otherwise.

 - Functie: int cbc_crypt (char *KEY, char *BLOCKS, unsigned LEN,
          unsigned MODE, char *IVEC)
     The function `cbc_crypt' encrypts or decrypts one or more blocks
     using DES in Cipher Block Chaining mode.

     For encryption in CBC mode, each block is exclusive-ored with IVEC
     before being encrypted, then IVEC is replaced with the result of
     the encryption, then the next block is processed.  Decryption is
     the reverse of this process.

     This has the advantage that blocks which are the same before being
     encrypted are very unlikely to be the same after being encrypted,
     making it much harder to detect patterns in the data.

     Usually, IVEC is set to 8 random bytes before encryption starts.
     Then the 8 random bytes are transmitted along with the encrypted
     data (without themselves being encrypted), and passed back in as
     IVEC for decryption.  Another possibility is to set IVEC to 8
     zeroes initially, and have the first the block encrypted consist
     of 8 random bytes.

     Otherwise, all the parameters are similar to those for `ecb_crypt'.

 - Functie: void des_setparity (char *KEY)
     The function `des_setparity' changes the 64-bit KEY, stored packed
     in 8-bit bytes, to have odd parity by altering the low bits of
     each byte.

   The `ecb_crypt', `cbc_crypt', and `des_setparity' functions and
their accompanying macros are all defined in the header
`rpc/des_crypt.h'.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
**********************************

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place -- Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
     
     [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
      numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble
========

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility
programs.  This license, the GNU Library General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries.  This license is quite
different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't
assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.

   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is
that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or
adding to a program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a
library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using
the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or
application program.  However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked
executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library,
and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended
to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to
achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved
it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The
hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
     contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
     authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
     this Library General Public License (also called "this License").
     Each licensee is addressed as "you".

     A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
     prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
     (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
     which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
     Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter,
     translation is included without limitation in the term
     "modification".)

     "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code
     means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the library.

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and
     output from such a program is covered only if its contents
     constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
     the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
     depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
     the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
     that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
     intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
     absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
     along with the Library.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. The modified work must itself be a software library.

       b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
          charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or
          a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
          uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
          facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
          to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
          such function or table, the facility still operates, and
          performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
          application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function
          must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
          square root function must still compute square roots.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Library.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.
     To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
     License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public
     License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer
     version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License
     has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
     wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.

     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
     all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
     the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
     derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
     form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
     accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
     interchange.

     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
     the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
     compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
     Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
     the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

     However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because
     it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that
     uses the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this
     License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such
     executables.

     When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
     file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may
     be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
     not.  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
     can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
     library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
     defined by law.

     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
     file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
     derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus
     portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section
     6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
     whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
     link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
     work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
     under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
     modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
     engineering for debugging such modifications.

     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
     by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the
     work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include
     the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
     reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also,
     you must do one of these things:

       a. Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code for the Library including
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
          distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work
          is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
          machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
          and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
          and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
          the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who
          changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
          not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use
          the modified definitions.)

       b. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
          three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
          Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
          performing this distribution.

       c. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
          from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the
          above specified materials from the same place.

       d. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
          materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

     For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
     Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special
     exception, the source code distributed need not include anything
     that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
     with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
     operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.

     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
     cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
     that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
     library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
     such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
     of the work based on the Library and of the other library
     facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
     two things:

       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
          facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
          Sections above.

       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
          that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
          where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
          work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
     Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
     your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
     received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
     full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
     based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
     Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose
     any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Library.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library
     does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
     write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
     decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
     status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
     the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
==============================================

   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE LIBRARY'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
     under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published
     by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.
     
     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Library General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library
     `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1990
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   That's all there is to it!
