  `%[FORMAT]-[ARGUMENT]' references the contents of an *environment
variable*, e.g.:

     The text `I am `%-USER '-user' will be expanded to
     ==> `I am `guest'-user', in case you logged-in as guest on your
     system.

  This special text *must* always be trailed by a _whitespace_
character which is removed in output!

Difference value `%[FORMAT]?' special texts
...........................................

  The use of the other difference values as listed here is to calculate
distance values between two dates.  In case these special texts are
directly lead by a `-' character, e.g. `-%d', Gcal switches the sign of
the computed value.

  You may depreciate the special meaning of the `-' character --in case
this character itself is needed-- by placing a `\' (backslash)
character before it, e.g. `\-'.  If you need the `\-' characters
themselves, you have to protect the `\' (backslash) character by
another `\' (backslash) character, e.g. `\\-'.

  The following other difference values `%[FORMAT]?' special texts are
respected:

`%d'
     Specifies the current respectively queried *day* relative to the
     actual system date (==today), e.g.:

          The resource file line `0 %d days gone' will be expanded to
          ==> `-10 days gone', in case you call Gcal with the `-c10-'
          option and no command.

`%w'
     Specifies the current respectively queried *week* relative to the
     actual system date (==today).  Started weeks are counted as
     complete weeks.

`%m'
     Specifies the current respectively queried *month* relative to the
     actual system date (==today).  Started months are counted as
     complete months.

`%y'
     Specifies the current respectively queried *year* relative to the
     actual system date (==today).  Started years are counted as
     complete years.  This special text *must* always be trailed by a
     _whitespace_ character which is removed in output!

  An example:

  Supposing, the actual system date is the 4th September 1999.  To
calculate, how many days, weeks, months and years are between the
actual system date and the birthday of a person, who is born on 21st
September 1962, Gcal can be called as follows:

     $ gcal -f/dev/null -Ux -u -#'19620921 %y %m %w %d~' 1962
     -|
     -| -37 -444 -1928 -13497
     -|
     $ gcal -f/dev/null -Ux -u -#'19620921 \\-%y \-%m %w -%d~' 1962
     -|
     -| \--37 --444 -1928 13497
     -|
     $ gcal -f/dev/null -Ux -u -#'00000904 %y %m %w %d~' %19620921 1999
     -|
     -| 37 444 1928 13497
     -|
     $ gcal -f/dev/null -Ux -u -#'00000904 %y %B19620921' %19620921 1962
     -|
     -| 37 36

Please do not confound the relative year number `%[FORMAT]y' special
text with the age value `%B' special text (*note Age value
`%[FORMAT]B[DATE]' special text: x-Age-value.).  The `%y' special text
counts started years as complete years, while the `%B' special text
does not.

Highlighting `%?' special texts
...............................

  The following highlighting `%?' special texts are respected:

`%1'
     `%1' is replaced by the starting highlighting sequence respectively
     the starting marking character that is used for highlighting the
     actual day (*note Global option `--highlighting=TEXT':
     x-highlighting.).  This attains, that all succeeding text of the
     line after this special text is displayed in the same way as the
     highlighted respectively marked actual day.  `%1' is used together
     with the `%2' special text, which turns off this enabled
     highlighting sequence respectively produces the ending marking
     character.  If a `%1' text is not succeeded by a `%2' text on the
     line, Gcal automatically inserts such a `%2' text at the end of
     the line.

     For example:

          Only %1THIS%2 word is highlighted in this line.
          %1This text is highlighted up to%2 here.
          All from %1here up to the end of the line is highlighted.

`%2'
     `%2' is replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively
     the ending marking character that is used for highlighting the
     actual day.  This attains, that a possibly active highlighting
     according to the actual day is turned off respectively an ending
     marking character is produced.  `%2' is used together with the
     `%1' special text.  The `%2' text has no affect if no preceding
     `%1' text was found on the line.

`%3'
     `%3' is replaced by the starting highlighting sequence respectively
     the starting marking character that is used for highlighting a
     holiday, (*note Global option `--highlighting=TEXT':
     x-highlighting.).  This attains, that all succeeding text of the
     line after this special text is displayed in the same way as the
     highlighted respectively marked holiday.  `%3' is used together
     with the `%4' special text, which turns off this enabled
     highlighting sequence respectively produces the ending marking
     character.  If a `%3' text is not succeeded by a `%4' text on the
     line, Gcal automatically inserts such a `%4' text at the end of
     the line.

     For example:

          Only %3THIS%4 word is highlighted in this line.
          %3This text is highlighted up to%4 here.
          All from %3here up to the end of the line is highlighted.

`%4'
     `%4' is replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively
     the ending marking character that is used for highlighting a
     holiday.  This attains, that a possibly active highlighting
     according to a holiday is turned off respectively an ending
     marking character is produced.  `%4' is used together with the
     `%3' special text.  The `%4' text has no affect if no preceding
     `%3' text was found on the line.

`%5'
     `%5' is replaced by the starting highlighting sequence respectively
     the starting marking character that is used for highlighting the
     actual day if a fixed date is on today's date, (*note Global
     option `--highlighting=TEXT': x-highlighting.).  This attains,
     that all succeeding text of the line after this special text is
     displayed in the same way as the highlighted respectively marked
     actual day.  `%5' is used together with the `%6' special text,
     which turns off this enabled highlighting sequence respectively
     produces the ending marking character.  If a `%5' text is not
     succeeded by a `%6' text on the line, Gcal automatically inserts
     such a `%6' text at the end of the line.

`%6'
     `%6' is replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively
     the ending marking character that is used for highlighting the
     actual day if a fixed date is on today's date.  This attains, that
     a possibly active highlighting according to the actual day is
     turned off respectively an ending marking character is produced.
     `%6' is used together with the `%5' special text.  The `%6' text
     has no affect if no preceding `%5' text was found on the line.

`%7'
     `%7' is replaced by the starting highlighting sequence respectively
     the starting marking character that is used for highlighting a
     holiday if a fixed date is on a legal holiday date, (*note Global
     option `--highlighting=TEXT': x-highlighting.).  This attains,
     that all succeeding text of the line after this special text is
     displayed in the same way as the highlighted respectively marked
     holiday.  `%7' is used together with the `%8' special text, which
     turns off this enabled highlighting sequence respectively produces
     the ending marking character.  If a `%7' text is not succeeded by
     a `%8' text on the line, Gcal automatically inserts such a `%8'
     text at the end of the line.

`%8'
     `%8' is replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively
     the ending marking character that is used for highlighting a
     holiday if a fixed date is on a legal holiday date.  This attains,
     that a possibly active highlighting according to a holiday is
     turned off respectively an ending marking character is produced.
     `%8' is used together with the `%7' special text.  The `%8' text
     has no affect if no preceding `%7' text was found on the line.

`%9'
     `%9' is replaced by the starting highlighting sequence
     respectively the starting marking character that is used for
     highlighting the actual day if a fixed date is on today's date;
     otherwise `%9' is replaced by the starting highlighting sequence
     respectively the starting marking character that is used for
     highlighting a holiday if a fixed date is on a legal holiday date,
     (*note Global option `--highlighting=TEXT': x-highlighting.).
     This attains, that all succeeding text of the line after this
     special text is displayed in the same way as the highlighted
     respectively marked actual day or holiday.  `%9' is used together
     with the `%0' special text, which turns off this enabled
     highlighting sequence respectively produces the ending marking
     character.  If a `%9' text is not succeeded by a `%0' text on the
     line, Gcal automatically inserts such a `%0' text at the end of
     the line.

`%0'
     `%0' is replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively
     the ending marking character that is used for highlighting the
     actual day if a fixed date is on today's date; otherwise `%0' is
     replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively the
     ending marking character that is used for highlighting a holiday
     if a fixed date is on a legal holiday date.  This attains, that a
     possibly active highlighting according to today's date or a
     holiday is turned off respectively an ending marking character is
     produced.  `%0' is used together with the `%9' special text.  The
     `%0' text has no affect if no preceding `%9' text was found on the
     line.

Shell command `%![ARGUMENT]' special text
=========================================

  The ARGUMENT which trails `%!' until the end of the line, is passed
to the shell as a command for further processing.  But before, all text
variable references and `%?'... special texts for replacing particular
texts which are given in ARGUMENT are interpreted by Gcal.  *Note Text
variables::, and *Note `%?'... special texts for text replacement:
Replacements.  All leading text before the `%!' special text is
processed by Gcal as usual.  If the simple `--debug' respectively
`--debug=internal' option is given at program start-up, informational
messages about the executed command and its _exit code_ will be shown
on the _standard error channel_ (*note Global option
`--debug=internal': x-debug-internal.).

  If the `--debug=abort' option is given, the Gcal program will be
aborted with an error code in case an _exit code_ not equal zero has
occurred during the execution of the command.  *Note Error Code 2:
x-2-Error-code, and *Note Global option `--debug=abort': x-debug-abort,
for further information.

  Use the `--execute-command' option if you want to execute all
`%![ARGUMENT]' special texts by the shell instead of seeing them
textually only.  *Note Fixed date option `--execute-command':
x-execute-command, for more details.
