1 Introduction
**************

An "ID database" is a binary file containing a list of file names, a
list of tokens, and a sparse matrix indicating which tokens appear in
which files.

   With this database and some tools to query it (described in this
manual), many text-searching tasks become simpler and faster.  For
example, you can list all files that reference a particular `#include'
file throughout a huge source hierarchy, search for all the memos
containing references to a project, or automatically invoke an editor
on all files containing references to some function or variable.
Anyone with a large software project to maintain, or a large set of text
files to organize, can benefit from the ID utilities.

   Although the name `ID' is short for `identifier', the ID utilities
handle more than just identifiers; they also treat other kinds of
tokens, most notably numeric constants, and the contents of certain
character strings.  Thus, this manual will use the word "token" as a
term that is inclusive of identifiers, numbers and strings.

   There are several programs in the ID utilities family:

`mkid'
     scans files for tokens and builds the ID database file.

`lid'
     queries the ID database for tokens, then reports matching file
     names or matching lines.

`fid'
     lists all tokens recorded in the database for given files, or
     tokens common to two files.

`fnid'
     matches the file names in the database, rather than the tokens.

`xtokid'
     extracts raw tokens--helps with testing of new `mkid' scanners.


   In addition, the ID utilities have historically provided several
query programs which are specializations of `lid':

`gid'
     (alias for `lid -R grep') lists all lines containing the requested
     pattern.

`eid'
     (alias for `lid -R edit') invokes an editor on all files
     containing the requested pattern, and if possible, initiates a
     text search for that pattern.

`aid'
     (alias for `lid -ils') treats the requested pattern as a
     case-insensitive literal substring.


   Please report bugs to `bug-gnu-utils@gnu.ai.mit.edu'.  Remember to
include the version number, machine architecture, input files, and any
other information needed to reproduce the bug: your input, what you
expected, what you got, and why it is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but
please include a description of the problem as well, since this is
sometimes difficult to infer.  *Note Bugs: (gcc)Bugs.

2 Quick Start Procedure
***********************

     Unpack the distribution.

     Type `./configure'

     Type `make'

     Type `make install' as a user with the appropriate privileges
     (e.g., `bin' or perhaps even `root').

     Type `cd /usr/include; mkid' to build an ID database covering all
     of the system header files.

     Type `lid FILE', then `gid strtok', then `aid stdout'.


   You have just built, installed and used the most common commands of
the GNU ID utilities.  If you ever need help remembering which system
header files contain a particular declaration, or reference a
particular symbol, you'll want to keep the ID file you built in
`/usr/include' for later use.  If your working directory is elsewhere
at the time, simply provide the `-f /usr/include' option to `lid'
(*note Reading options::).

3 Common command-line options
*****************************

Certain options, and regular expression syntax, are shared by various
groupings of the ID utilities.  We describe these in the sections below,
rather than repeating them for each program.

* Menu:

* Universal options::     Options common to all programs.
* Extraction options::    Options for programs that extract tokens from source files.
* Walker options::        Options for programs that walk file and directory trees.
* Reading options::       Options for programs that read ID databases.
* Writing options::       Options for programs that write ID databases.
* File listing options::  Options for programs that list file names.


File: id-utils.info,  Node: Universal options,  Next: Extraction options,  Up: Common options

3.1 Options Common to All Programs
==================================

`--help'
     Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
     successfully.

`--version'
     Print the version number, then exit successfully.



File: id-utils.info,  Node: Reading options,  Next: Writing options,  Prev: Walker options,  Up: Common options

3.2 Options for Programs that Read ID Databases
===============================================

`-f FILENAME'
`--file=FILENAME'
     FILENAME is the ID database to read when processing queries.  At
     present, only a single `--file' option is processed, but in future
     releases, more than one ID database may be named on the command
     line.

`$IDPATH'
     `IDPATH' is an environment variable that contains a
     colon-separated list of ID database names.  If this variable is
     present, and no `--file' options are presented on the command
     line, the ID databases named in `IDPATH' are implied.(1)


   If no ID databases are specified either on the command line or via
the `IDPATH' environment variable, then the ID utilities search for a
file named `ID' in the current working directory, and then in
successive parent directories.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) At present, this feature isn't fully implemented, since only the
first of a list of ID database names is processed.

3.3 Options for Programs that Write ID Databases
================================================

`-o FILENAME'
`--output=FILENAME'
     The `--output' option names the file in which to write a new ID
     database.  If no `--output' (or `--file') option is present, an
     output file named `ID' is implied.

`-f FILENAME'
`--file=FILENAME'
     This is a synonym for `--output'



File: id-utils.info,  Node: Walker options,  Next: Reading options,  Prev: Extraction options,  Up: Common options

3.4 Options for Programs that Walk File and Directory Trees.
============================================================

The programs `mkid' and `xtokid' accept the names of files and
directories on the command line.  Files are scanned if there is a
scanner available and enabled for the file's source language.
Directories are recursively descended, searching for files whose names
match the rules listed in the _language map_ file (*note Language
map::).

   The following option controls the file tree walker:

`-p NAMES'
`--prune=NAMES'
     One or more file or directory names may appear in NAMES.  The file
     tree walker will stop short at these files and directories and
     their contents will not be scanned.



File: id-utils.info,  Node: File listing options,  Prev: Writing options,  Up: Common options

3.5 Options for Programs that List File Names
=============================================

The programs `lid' and `fnid' can print lists of file names as the
result of queries.  The following option controls how these lists are
formatted:

`-S STYLE'
`--separator=STYLE'
     STYLE may be one of `braces', `space' or `newline'.

     The STYLE of `braces' means that file names with common directory
     prefix and common suffix are printed using the shell's brace
     notation in order to compress the output.  For example,
     `../src/foo.c ../src/bar.c' can be printed in brace notation as
     `../src/{foo,bar}.c'.

     The STYLEs of `space' and `newline' mean that file names are
     separated spaces or by newlines, respectively.

     If the list of files is being printed on a terminal, brace
     notation is the default.  If not, file names are separated by
     spaces if the KEY is included in the output, and by newlines the
     KEY STYLE is `none' (*note lid invocation::).



File: id-utils.info,  Node: Extraction options,  Next: Walker options,  Prev: Universal options,  Up: Common options

3.6 Options for Programs that Scan Source Files
===============================================

`mkid' and `xtokid' walk file trees, select source files by name, and
extract tokens from source files.  They accept the following options:

`-m MAPFILE'
`--lang-map=MAPFILE'
     MAPFILE contains rules for determining the source languages from
     file names *Note Language map::.

`-i LANGUAGES'
`--include=LANGUAGES'
     The `--include' option names LANGUAGES whose source files should
     be scanned and incorporated into the ID database.  By default, all
     languages known to the ID utilities are enabled.

`-x LANGUAGES'
`--exclude=LANGUAGES'
     The `--exclude' option names LANGUAGES whose source files should
     NOT be scanned.  The default list of excluded languages is empty.
     Note that only one of `--include' or `--exclude' may be specified
     on the command line for a single run.

`-l LANGUAGE:OPTIONS'
`--lang-option=LANGUAGE:OPTIONS'
     Language-specific scanners also accept options.  LANGUAGE denotes
     the desired scanner, and OPTION are the command-line options that
     should be passed through to it.  For example, to pass the -X
     -COKE-BOTTLE options to the scanner for the language SWIZZLE, pass
     this: -L SWIZZLE:"-X -COKE-BOTTLE", or this:
     -LANG-OPTION=SWIZZLE:"-X -COKE-BOTTLE", or this: -L SWIZZLE-X -L
     SWIZZLE:-COKE-BOTTLE.  Use the `--help' option to see the
     command-line option summary for


   To determine which tokens to extract from a file and store in the
database, `mkid' calls a "scanner"; we say a scanner "recognizes" a
particular language.  Scanners for several languages are built-in to
`mkid'; you can add your own scanners as well, as explained in *Note
Defining scanners::.

   The ID utilities determine which scanner to use for a particular
file by consulting the language-map file.  Scanners for several are
already built-in to the ID utilities.  You can see which languages have
built-in scanners, and examine their language-specific options by
invoking `mkid --help' or `xtokid --help'.

3.6.1 Mapping file names to source languages
--------------------------------------------

The file `id-lang.map', installed by default in
`$(prefix)/share/id-lang.map', contains rules for mapping file names to
source languages.  Each rule comprises three parts: a shell GLOB
pattern, a language name, and language-specific scanner options.

   The special pattern `**' denotes the default source language.  This
is the language that's assigned to file names that don't match any other
pattern.

   The special pattern `***' should be followed by a file name.  The
named file should contain more language-map rules and is included at
this point.

   The order in which rules are presented in a language-map file is
significant.  This order influences the order in which files are
displayed as the result of queries.  For example, the distributed
language-map file places all rules for C .H files ahead of .C files, so
that in general, declarations will precede definitions in query output.
The same thing is done for C++ and its many different source file name
extensions.

   Here is a pared-down version of the `id-lang.map' file distributed
with the ID utilities:


     # Default language
     **			IGNORE	# Although this is listed first,
     				# the default language pattern is
     				# logically matched last.

     # Backup files

File: id-utils.info,  Node: C/C++ scanner,  Next: Assembler scanner,  Prev: Language map,  Up: Extraction options

3.6.2 C/C++ Language Scanner
----------------------------

The C scanner is the most commonly used.  Files that match the glob
pattern `*.h', `*.c', as well as `yacc' files that match `*.y' or
`*.yacc', and `lex' files that match `*.l' or `*.lex', are processed
with this scanner.

   Scanner-specific options (Note, these options are presented WITHOUT
the required `-l' or `--lang-option=' prefix):

`-k CHARACTER-CLASS'
`--keep=CHARACTER-CLASS'
     Consider the characters in CHARACTER-CLASS as valid constituents of
     identifier names.  For example, if you are indexing C code that
     contains `$' in some of its identifiers, you can include these by
     using `--lang-option=C:--keep=$', or `-l C:"-k $"' (if you don't
     like to type so much).

`-i CHARACTER-CLASS'
`--ignore=CHARACTER-CLASS'
     Consider the characters in CHARACTER-CLASS as valid constituents of
     identifier names, but discard all tokens containing these
     characters.  For example, if some C code has identifiers
     containing `$', but you don't want these cluttering up your ID
     database, use `--lang-option=C:--ignore=$', or the terser
     equivalent `-l C:"-i $"'.

`-u'
`--strip-underscore'
     Strip one leading underscore from C identifiers encapsulated as
     character strings.  This option is useful if you are indexing C
     code that contains symbol-table name strings for systems that
     prepend an underscore to external symbols.  By default, the
     leading underscore is retained.



File: id-utils.info,  Node: Assembler scanner,  Next: Text scanner,  Prev: C/C++ scanner,  Up: Extraction options

3.6.3 Assembly Language Scanner
-------------------------------

Assembly languages use a variety of commenting conventions, and allow a
variety of special characters to _dirty up_ local symbols, preventing
name space conflicts with symbols defined by higher-level languages.
Also, some compilation systems prepend an underscore to external
symbols.  The options listed below are designed to address these
differences.

`-c CHARACTER-CLASS'
`--comment=CHARACTER-CLASS'
     The characters in CHARACTER-CLASS are considered left delimiters
     for comments that extend until the end of the current line.

`-k CHARACTER-CLASS'
`--keep=CHARACTER-CLASS'
     Consider the characters of CHARACTER-CLASS as valid constituents of
     identifier names.  For example, if you are indexing assembly code
     that prepends `.' to assembler directives, and prepends `%' to
     register names, you can keep these characters in the tokens by
     specifying `--lang-option=asm:--keep=.%', or `-l asm:"-k .%"'.

`-i CHARACTER-CLASS'
`--ignore=CHARACTER-CLASS'
     Consider the characters of CHARACTER-CLASS as valid constituents
     of identifier names, but discard all tokens containing these
     characters.  For example, if you don't want to clutter your ID
     database with assembler directives that begin with a leading `.'
     or with assembler labels that contain `@', use
     `--lang-option=asm:--ignore=.@', or `-l asm:"-i .@"'.

`-u'
`--strip-underscore'
     Strip one leading underscore from identifiers.  This option is
     useful if your compilation system prepends an underscore to
     external symbols.  By stripping the underscore, you can
     canonicalize such names and bring them into conformance the way
     they are expressed in the C language.  By default, the leading
     underscore is retained.

`-n'
`--no-cpp'
     Do not recognize C preprocessor directives.  By default, such
     lines are handled in the same way as they are by the C language
     scanner.

3.6.4 Text Scanner
------------------

The plain text scanner is intended for human-language documents, or as
the scanner of last resort for files that have no scanner that is more
specific.  It is customizable to the extent that character classes can
be designated as token constituents or as token delimiters.  The default
token constituents are the alpha-numerics; all other characters are
considered token delimiters.

`-i CHARACTER-CLASS'
`--include=CHARACTER-CLASS'
     Include characters belonging to CHARACTER-CLASS in tokens.

`-x CHARACTER-CLASS'
`--exclude=CHARACTER-CLASS'
     Exclude characters belonging to CHARACTER-CLASS from tokens, i.e.,
     treat them as token delimiters.



File: id-utils.info,  Node: Perl scanner,  Next: Defining scanners,  Prev: Text scanner,  Up: Extraction options

3.6.5 Perl Scanner
------------------

(EXPERIMENTAL)

   The perl scanner is intended for perl-language documents. Tokens are
all words, Perl Keywords are included. Comments & string declarations
are ignored, as well as the documentation.  It is customizable to the
extent that character classes can be designated as token constituents
or as token delimiters.  The default token constituents are the
alpha-numerics; all other characters are considered token delimiters.

`-i CHARACTER-CLASS'
`--include=CHARACTER-CLASS'
     Include characters belonging to CHARACTER-CLASS in tokens.

`-x CHARACTER-CLASS'
`--exclude=CHARACTER-CLASS'
     Exclude characters belonging to CHARACTER-CLASS from tokens, i.e.,
     treat them as token delimiters.

`-d'
`--dtags'
     Include tokens from the documentation.  By default, the tokens in
     the documentation are ignored.



File: id-utils.info,  Node: Defining scanners,  Prev: Perl scanner,  Up: Extraction options

3.6.6 Defining New Scanners in the Source Code
----------------------------------------------

To add a new scanner in source code, you should add a new section to the
file `scanners.c'.  It might be easiest to clone one of the existing
scanners and modify it as necessary.  For the hypothetical language
FOO, you must define the functions `get_token_foo', `parse_args_foo',
`help_me_foo', as well as the tables `long_options_foo' and `args_foo'.
If your scanner is modeled after one of the existing scanners, you'll
also need a character-attribute table `ctype_foo'.

   This is not a terribly difficult programming task, but it requires
recompiling and installing the new version of `mkid' and `xtokid'.  You
should use `xtokid' to test the operation of the new scanner.

   Once these functions and tables are ready, add function prototypes
and an entry to the `languages_0' table near the beginning of the file.

   Be warned that the existing scanners are built for speed, not
elegance or readability.  You might wish to create a new scanner that's
easier to read and understand if you don't feel that speed is so
important.

4 `mkid': Creating an ID Database
*********************************

`mkid' builds an ID database.  It accepts the names of files and/or
directories on the command line, selects files that have an enabled
scanner, then extracts and stores tokens from those files.  The
resulting ID database is architecture- and byte-order-independent so it
can be shared among all systems.

   The primary virtues of `mkid' are speed and high capacity.  The size
of the source trees it can index is limited only by available system
memory.  `mkid''s indexing algorithm is very space-efficient and
exhibits excellent locality-of-reference, and so is capable of
operating with a working-set size that is only half the size of its
virtual address space.  A typical UNIX-like operating system with 16
megabytes of system memory should be able to build an ID database
covering approximately 12,000-14,000 source files totaling
approximately 50-100 Megabytes.  A 66 MHz 486 computer can build such a
large ID database in approximately 10-15 minutes.

   In a future release, `mkid' will be able to incrementally update an
ID database much faster than it can build one from scratch.  Until this
feature becomes available, it might be a good idea to schedule a `cron'
job to regularly update large ID databases during off-hours.

   `mkid' writes the ID file, therefore it accepts the `--output' (and
`--file') options as described in *Note Writing options::.  `mkid'
extracts tokens from source files, therefore it accepts the
`--lang-map', `--include', `--exclude', and `--lang-option' options, as
well as the language-specific scanner options, all of which are
described in *Note Extraction options::.  `mkid' walks file trees,
therefore it handles file and directory names on its command line and
the `--prune' option as described in *Note Walker options::.

   In addition, `mkid' accepts the following command-line options:

`-s'
`--statistics'
     `mkid' reports statistics about resource usage at the end of its
     run.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     `mkid' reports statistics about each file as it is scanned, and
     about the resource usage of its indexing algorithm at regular
     intervals.

5 `lid': Querying an ID Database by Token
*****************************************

The `lid' program accepts PATTERNS on the command line which it matches
against the tokens stored in an ID database.  The interpretation of a
PATTERN is determined by the makeup of the PATTERN string itself, or
can be overridden by command-line options.  If a PATTERN contains
regular expression meta-characters, it is used to perform a
regular-expression substring search.  If no such meta-characters are
present, PATTERN is used to perform a literal word search.  (By
default, all searches are sensitive to alphabetic case.)  If no PATTERN
is supplied on the command line, `lid' lists every entry in the ID
database.

   `lid' reads the ID database, therefore it accepts the `--file'
option, and consults the `IDPATH' environment variable, as described in
*Note Reading options::.  `lid' lists file names, therefore it accepts
the `--separator' option, as described in *Note File listing options::.

   In addition, `lid' accepts the following command-line options:

`-i'
`--ignore-case'
     Ignoring differences in alphabetic case between the PATTERN and
     the tokens in the ID database.

`-l'
`--literal'
     Match PATTERN as a literal string.  Use this option if PATTERN
     contains regular-expression meta-characters, but you don't wish to
     perform a regular-expression search.

`-r'
`--regexp'
     Match PATTERN as an _extended_ regular expression(1).  Use this
     option if no regular-expression expression meta-characters are
     present in PATTERN, but you wish to force a regular-expression
     search (note: in this case, a _literal substring_ search might be
     faster).

`-w'
`--word'
     Match PATTERN using a word-delimited (non substring) search.  This
     is the default for literal searches.

`-s'
`--substring'
     Match PATTERN using a substring (non word-delimited) search.  This
     is the default for regular expression searches.

`-k STYLE'
`--key=STYLE'
     STYLE can be one of `token', `pattern' or `none'.  This option
     controls how the subject of the query is presented.  This is best
     illustrated by example:

          $ lid --key=token '^dest.'
          destaddr       libsys/memcpy.c
          destination    libsys/regex.c
          destlst        libsys/rx.c
          destpos        libsys/rx.c
          destset        libsys/rx.h libsys/rx.c

          $ lid --key=pattern '^dest.'
          ^dest.         libsys/rx.h libsys/{memcpy,regex,rx}.c

          $ lid --key=none '^dest.'
          libsys/rx.h libsys/{memcpy,regex,rx}.c

     When `--key' is either `token' or `pattern', the first column of
     output is a TOKEN or PATTERN, respectively.  When `--key' is
     `none', neither of these is printed, and the file name list begins
     immediately.  The default is `token'.

`-R STYLE'
`--result=STYLE'
     STYLE can be one of `filenames', `grep', `edit' or `none'.  This
     option controls how the value associated with the query's KEY
     presented.  When STYLE is `filenames', a list of file names is
     printed (this is the default).  When STYLE is `grep', the lines
     that match PATTERN are printed in the same format as `egrep -n'.
     When STYLE is `edit', the file names are passed to an editor, and
     if possible PATTERN is passed as an initial search string (*note
     eid invocation::).  When STYLE is `none', the file names are not
     processed in any way.  This can be useful if you wish to see what
     tokens match a PATTERN, but don't care about where they reside.

`-d'
`-o'
`-x'
     These options may be used in any combination to specify the radix
     of numeric matches.  `-d' allows matching on decimal numbers, `-o'
     on octal numbers, and `-x' on hexadecimal numbers.  Any
     combination of these options may be used.  The default is to match
     all three radixes.

`-F RANGE'
`--frequency=RANGE'
     Match tokens whose occurrence count falls in RANGE.  RANGE may be
     expressed as a single number N, or as a range N`..'M.  Either
     limit of the range may be omitted (e.g., `..'M, or N..`..').  If
     the lower limit N is omitted, it defaults to `1'.  If the upper
     limit is omitted, it defaults in the present implementation to
     `65535', the maximum value of an unsigned 16-bit integer.

     Particularly useful queries are `lid -F1', which helps locate
     identifiers that are defined but never used, or are used but never
     defined.  Similarly, `lid -F2' can help find functions that possess
     a prototype declaration and a definition, but are never called.

`-a NUMBER'
`--ambiguous=NUMBER'
     List identifiers (not numbers) that are ambiguous for the first
     NUMBER characters.  This feature might be in useful when porting
     programs to ancient pea-brained compilers that don't support long
     identifier names.  However, the best long-term option is to set
     such systems on fire.

5.1 Aliases for Specialized `lid' Queries
=========================================

Historically, the ID utilities have provided several query interfaces
which are specializations of `lid' (*note lid invocation::).

`gid'
     (alias for `lid -R grep') lists all lines containing the requested
     pattern.

`eid'
     (alias for `lid -R edit') invokes an editor on all files
     containing the requested pattern, and optionally initiates a text
     search for that pattern.

`aid'
     (alias for `lid -ils') treats the requested pattern as a
     case-insensitive literal substring.



File: id-utils.info,  Node: Emacs gid interface,  Next: eid invocation,  Prev: lid aliases,  Up: lid invocation

5.2 GNU Emacs query interface
=============================

The `id-utils' source distribution comes with a file `id-utils.el',
which defines a GNU Emacs interface to `gid'.  To install it, put
`id-utils.el' somewhere that Emacs will find it (i.e., in your
`load-path') and put

     (autoload 'gid "gid" nil t)

in one of Emacs' initialization files, e.g., `~/.emacs'.  You will then
be able to use `M-x gid' to run the command.

   The `gid' function prompts you with the word around point.  If you
want to search for something else, simply delete the line and type the
pattern of interest.

   The function then runs the `gid' program in a `*compilation*'
buffer, so the normal `next-error' function can be used to visit all
the places the identifier is found (*note Compilation:
(emacs)Compilation.).


File: id-utils.info,  Node: eid invocation,  Prev: Emacs gid interface,  Up: lid invocation

5.3 `eid': Invoking an Editor on Query Results
==============================================

`lid -R edit' is an editing interface for the ID utilities that is most
commonly used with `vi'.  Emacs users should use the interface defined
in `id-utils.el' (*note Emacs gid interface::).  The ID utilities
include an alias called `eid', and for the sake of brevity, we'll use
this alias for the remainder of this section.  `eid' performs a
`lid'-style, then asks if you wish to edit the files.  If your query
yields more than one line of output, you will be prompted after each
line.  This is the prompt you'll see:

     Edit? [y1-9^S/nq]

You may respond with:

`y'
     Edit all files listed.

`1...9'
     Edit all files starting at the N + 1'st file.

`/STRING or CTRL-SREGEXP'
     Search into the file list, and begin editing with the first file
     name that matches the regular expression REGEXP.

`n'
     Don't edit any files.  If another line of query output is pending,
     advance to that line, for which another `Edit?' prompt will appear.

`q'
     Quit--don't edit any files, and don't process any more lines of
     query output.


   Here is an example:

     prompt$ eid FILE \^print
     FILE           {ansi2knr,fid,filenames,idfile,idx,lid,misc,...}.c
     Edit? [y1-9^S/nq] n
     ^print         {ansi2knr,fid,getopt,getopt1,lid,mkid,regex,scanners}.c
     Edit? [y1-9^S/nq] 2

This will start editing at `getopt'.c.

   `eid' invokes the editor defined by the environment variable
`VISUAL'.  If `VISUAL' is undefined, it uses the environment variable
`EDITOR' instead.  If `EDITOR' is undefined, it defaults to `vi'.  It
is possible for `eid' to pass the editor an initial search pattern so
that your cursor will immediately alight on the token of interest.
This feature is controlled by the following environment variables:

`EIDARG'
     A printf(3) format string for the editor argument to search for the
     matching token.  For `vi', this should be `+/%s/'.

`EIDLDEL'
     The regular-expression meta-character(s) for delimiting the
     beginning of a word (the ``eid' Left DELimiter').  `eid' inserts
     this in front of the matching token when a word-search is desired.
     For `vi', this should be `\<'.

`EIDRDEL'
     The regular-expression meta-character(s) for delimiting the end of
     a word (the ``eid' Right DELimiter').  `eid' inserts this in end
     of the matching token when a word-search is desired.  For `vi',
     this should be `\>'.

6 `fid': Listing a file's tokens
********************************

`fid' prints the tokens found in a given file.  If two file names are
passed on the command line, `fid' prints the tokens that are common to
both files (i.e., the _set intersection_ of the two token sets).

   `fid' reads the ID database, therefore it accepts the `--file'
option, and consults the `IDPATH' environment variable, as described in
*Note Reading options::.

   If the standard output is attached to a terminal, the printed tokens
are separated by spaces.  Otherwise, the tokens are printed one per
line.


File: id-utils.info,  Node: fnid invocation,  Next: xtokid invocation,  Prev: fid invocation,  Up: Top

7 `fnid': Looking up filenames
******************************

`fnid' queries the list of file names stored in the ID database.  It
accepts shell _wildcard_ patterns on the command line.  If no pattern
is supplied, `*' is implied.  `fnid' prints the file names that match
the given patterns.

   `fnid' prints file names, and as such accepts the `--separator'
option as described in *Note File listing options::.

   For example, the command:

     fnid \*.c

lists all the `.c' files in the database.  (The `\' here protects the
`*' from being expanded by the shell.)


File: id-utils.info,  Node: xtokid invocation,  Next: Past and Future,  Prev: fnid invocation,  Up: Top

8 `xtokid': Testing Language Scanners
*************************************

`xtokid' accepts the names of files and/or directories on the command
line, then extracts and prints a stream of tokens from those files for
which it has a valid, enabled scanner.  This is useful primarily for
debugging new `mkid' scanners (*note Defining scanners::).

   `xtokid' extracts tokens from source files, therefore it accepts the
`--lang-map', `--include', `--exclude', and `--lang-option' options, as
well as the language-specific scanner options, all of which are
described in *Note Extraction options::.  `xtokid' walks file trees,
therefore it handles file and directory names on its command line and
the `--prune' option as described in *Note Walker options::.

   The name `xtokid' indicates that it is the "eXtract TOKens ID
utility".

9 Past and Future
*****************

Greg McGary conceived of the ideas behind the ID utilities when he
began working on the Unix kernel in 1984.  He needed a navigation tool
to help him find his way around the expansive, unfamiliar landscape.
The first `id-utils'-like tools were shell scripts, and produced an
ASCII database that looks much like the output of `lid ".*"'.  It took
over an hour on a VAX 11/750 to build a database for a 4.1BSD derived
kernel.  The first version of `lid' used the UNIX system utility
`look', modified to handle very long lines.

   In 1986, Greg rewrote the shell scripts in C to improve performance.
Build times for the ID file were shortened by an order of magnitude.
The ID utilities were first posted to `comp.sources.unix' in September
1987 under the name `id'.

   Over the next few years, several versions diverged from the original
source.  Tom Horsley at Harris Computer Systems Division stepped forward
to take over maintenance and integrated some of the fixes from divergent
versions.  A first release of the renamed `mkid' version 2 was posted
to `alt.sources' near the end of 1990.  At that time, Tom wrote a
Texinfo manual with the encouragement of the net community.  (Tom
especially thanks Doug Scofield and Bill Leonard whom he dragooned into
helping proofread and edit--they found several problems in the initial
version.)  Karl Berry revamped the manual for Texinfo style, indexing,
and organization in 1995.

   In January 1995, Greg McGary reemerged as the primary maintainer and
launched development of `mkid' version 3, whose primary new feature is
an efficient algorithm for building databases that is linear in both
time and space over the size of the input text.  (The old algorithm was
quadratic in space so it was incapable of handling very large source
trees.)  For the first time, the code was released under the GNU Public
License.

   In June 1996, the package was renamed again to `id-utils' and was
released for the first time under FSF copyright as part of the GNU
system.  All programs had their command-line arguments completely
revised.  The `mkid' and `xtokid' programs also gained a file-tree
walker, so that directory names can be passed on the command line
instead of the names of every individual file.  Greg reorganized and
rewrote most of the Texinfo manual to reflect these changes.

   Future releases of `id-utils' might include:

     an optional coupling with GNU `grep', so that `grep' can use an ID
     database for hints

     a `cscope' work-alike query interface

     incremental update of the ID database.
