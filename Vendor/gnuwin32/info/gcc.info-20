Machine Modes
=============

   A machine mode describes a size of data object and the
representation used for it.  In the C code, machine modes are
represented by an enumeration type, `enum machine_mode', defined in
`machmode.def'.  Each RTL expression has room for a machine mode and so
do certain kinds of tree expressions (declarations and types, to be
precise).

   In debugging dumps and machine descriptions, the machine mode of an
RTL expression is written after the expression code with a colon to
separate them.  The letters `mode' which appear at the end of each
machine mode name are omitted.  For example, `(reg:SI 38)' is a `reg'
expression with machine mode `SImode'.  If the mode is `VOIDmode', it
is not written at all.

   Here is a table of machine modes.  The term "byte" below refers to an
object of `BITS_PER_UNIT' bits (*note Storage Layout::).

`BImode'
     "Bit" mode represents a single bit, for predicate registers.

`QImode'
     "Quarter-Integer" mode represents a single byte treated as an
     integer.

`HImode'
     "Half-Integer" mode represents a two-byte integer.

`PSImode'
     "Partial Single Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
     four bytes but which doesn't really use all four.  On some
     machines, this is the right mode to use for pointers.

`SImode'
     "Single Integer" mode represents a four-byte integer.

`PDImode'
     "Partial Double Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
     eight bytes but which doesn't really use all eight.  On some
     machines, this is the right mode to use for certain pointers.

`DImode'
     "Double Integer" mode represents an eight-byte integer.

`TImode'
     "Tetra Integer" (?) mode represents a sixteen-byte integer.

`OImode'
     "Octa Integer" (?) mode represents a thirty-two-byte integer.

`SFmode'
     "Single Floating" mode represents a single-precision (four byte)
     floating point number.

`DFmode'
     "Double Floating" mode represents a double-precision (eight byte)
     floating point number.

`XFmode'
     "Extended Floating" mode represents a triple-precision (twelve
     byte) floating point number.  This mode is used for IEEE extended
     floating point.  On some systems not all bits within these bytes
     will actually be used.

`TFmode'
     "Tetra Floating" mode represents a quadruple-precision (sixteen
     byte) floating point number.

`CCmode'
     "Condition Code" mode represents the value of a condition code,
     which is a machine-specific set of bits used to represent the
     result of a comparison operation.  Other machine-specific modes
     may also be used for the condition code.  These modes are not used
     on machines that use `cc0' (see *note Condition Code::).

`BLKmode'
     "Block" mode represents values that are aggregates to which none of
     the other modes apply.  In RTL, only memory references can have
     this mode, and only if they appear in string-move or vector
     instructions.  On machines which have no such instructions,
     `BLKmode' will not appear in RTL.

`VOIDmode'
     Void mode means the absence of a mode or an unspecified mode.  For
     example, RTL expressions of code `const_int' have mode `VOIDmode'
     because they can be taken to have whatever mode the context
     requires.  In debugging dumps of RTL, `VOIDmode' is expressed by
     the absence of any mode.

`SCmode, DCmode, XCmode, TCmode'
     These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of
     floating point values.  The floating point values are in `SFmode',
     `DFmode', `XFmode', and `TFmode', respectively.

`CQImode, CHImode, CSImode, CDImode, CTImode, COImode'
     These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of
     integer values.  The integer values are in `QImode', `HImode',
     `SImode', `DImode', `TImode', and `OImode', respectively.

   The machine description defines `Pmode' as a C macro which expands
into the machine mode used for addresses.  Normally this is the mode
whose size is `BITS_PER_WORD', `SImode' on 32-bit machines.

   The only modes which a machine description must support are
`QImode', and the modes corresponding to `BITS_PER_WORD',
`FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE' and `DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.  The compiler will attempt to
use `DImode' for 8-byte structures and unions, but this can be
prevented by overriding the definition of `MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE'.
Alternatively, you can have the compiler use `TImode' for 16-byte
structures and unions.  Likewise, you can arrange for the C type `short
int' to avoid using `HImode'.

   Very few explicit references to machine modes remain in the compiler
and these few references will soon be removed.  Instead, the machine
modes are divided into mode classes.  These are represented by the
enumeration type `enum mode_class' defined in `machmode.h'.  The
possible mode classes are:

`MODE_INT'
     Integer modes.  By default these are `QImode', `HImode', `SImode',
     `DImode', and `TImode'.

`MODE_PARTIAL_INT'
     The "partial integer" modes, `PSImode' and `PDImode'.

`MODE_FLOAT'
     floating point modes.  By default these are `SFmode', `DFmode',
     `XFmode' and `TFmode'.

`MODE_COMPLEX_INT'
     Complex integer modes.  (These are not currently implemented).

`MODE_COMPLEX_FLOAT'
     Complex floating point modes.  By default these are `SCmode',
     `DCmode', `XCmode', and `TCmode'.

`MODE_FUNCTION'
     Algol or Pascal function variables including a static chain.
     (These are not currently implemented).

`MODE_CC'
     Modes representing condition code values.  These are `CCmode' plus
     any modes listed in the `EXTRA_CC_MODES' macro.  *Note Jump
     Patterns::, also see *Note Condition Code::.

`MODE_RANDOM'
     This is a catchall mode class for modes which don't fit into the
     above classes.  Currently `VOIDmode' and `BLKmode' are in
     `MODE_RANDOM'.

   Here are some C macros that relate to machine modes:

`GET_MODE (X)'
     Returns the machine mode of the RTX X.

`PUT_MODE (X, NEWMODE)'
     Alters the machine mode of the RTX X to be NEWMODE.

`NUM_MACHINE_MODES'
     Stands for the number of machine modes available on the target
     machine.  This is one greater than the largest numeric value of any
     machine mode.

`GET_MODE_NAME (M)'
     Returns the name of mode M as a string.

`GET_MODE_CLASS (M)'
     Returns the mode class of mode M.

`GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (M)'
     Returns the next wider natural mode.  For example, the expression
     `GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (QImode)' returns `HImode'.

`GET_MODE_SIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bytes of a datum of mode M.

`GET_MODE_BITSIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bits of a datum of mode M.

`GET_MODE_MASK (M)'
     Returns a bitmask containing 1 for all bits in a word that fit
     within mode M.  This macro can only be used for modes whose
     bitsize is less than or equal to `HOST_BITS_PER_INT'.

`GET_MODE_ALIGNMENT (M)'
     Return the required alignment, in bits, for an object of mode M.

`GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bytes of the subunits of a datum of mode M.
     This is the same as `GET_MODE_SIZE' except in the case of complex
     modes.  For them, the unit size is the size of the real or
     imaginary part.

`GET_MODE_NUNITS (M)'
     Returns the number of units contained in a mode, i.e.,
     `GET_MODE_SIZE' divided by `GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE'.

`GET_CLASS_NARROWEST_MODE (C)'
     Returns the narrowest mode in mode class C.

   The global variables `byte_mode' and `word_mode' contain modes whose
classes are `MODE_INT' and whose bitsizes are either `BITS_PER_UNIT' or
`BITS_PER_WORD', respectively.  On 32-bit machines, these are `QImode'
and `SImode', respectively.

Constant Expression Types
=========================

   The simplest RTL expressions are those that represent constant
values.

`(const_int I)'
     This type of expression represents the integer value I.  I is
     customarily accessed with the macro `INTVAL' as in `INTVAL (EXP)',
     which is equivalent to `XWINT (EXP, 0)'.

     There is only one expression object for the integer value zero; it
     is the value of the variable `const0_rtx'.  Likewise, the only
     expression for integer value one is found in `const1_rtx', the only
     expression for integer value two is found in `const2_rtx', and the
     only expression for integer value negative one is found in
     `constm1_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of code
     `const_int' and value zero, one, two or negative one will return
     `const0_rtx', `const1_rtx', `const2_rtx' or `constm1_rtx' as
     appropriate.

     Similarly, there is only one object for the integer whose value is
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is found in `const_true_rtx'.  If
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is one, `const_true_rtx' and `const1_rtx' will
     point to the same object.  If `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is -1,
     `const_true_rtx' and `constm1_rtx' will point to the same object.

`(const_double:M ADDR I0 I1 ...)'
     Represents either a floating-point constant of mode M or an
     integer constant too large to fit into `HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT'
     bits but small enough to fit within twice that number of bits (GNU
     CC does not provide a mechanism to represent even larger
     constants).  In the latter case, M will be `VOIDmode'.

     ADDR is used to contain the `mem' expression that corresponds to
     the location in memory that at which the constant can be found.  If
     it has not been allocated a memory location, but is on the chain
     of all `const_double' expressions in this compilation (maintained
     using an undisplayed field), ADDR contains `const0_rtx'.  If it is
     not on the chain, ADDR contains `cc0_rtx'.  ADDR is customarily
     accessed with the macro `CONST_DOUBLE_MEM' and the chain field via
     `CONST_DOUBLE_CHAIN'.

     If M is `VOIDmode', the bits of the value are stored in I0 and I1.
     I0 is customarily accessed with the macro `CONST_DOUBLE_LOW' and
     I1 with `CONST_DOUBLE_HIGH'.

     If the constant is floating point (regardless of its precision),
     then the number of integers used to store the value depends on the
     size of `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' (*note Cross-compilation::).  The
     integers represent a floating point number, but not precisely in
     the target machine's or host machine's floating point format.  To
     convert them to the precise bit pattern used by the target
     machine, use the macro `REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE' and friends
     (*note Data Output::).

     The macro `CONST0_RTX (MODE)' refers to an expression with value 0
     in mode MODE.  If mode MODE is of mode class `MODE_INT', it
     returns `const0_rtx'.  Otherwise, it returns a `CONST_DOUBLE'
     expression in mode MODE.  Similarly, the macro `CONST1_RTX (MODE)'
     refers to an expression with value 1 in mode MODE and similarly
     for `CONST2_RTX'.

`(const_string STR)'
     Represents a constant string with value STR.  Currently this is
     used only for insn attributes (*note Insn Attributes::) since
     constant strings in C are placed in memory.

`(symbol_ref:MODE SYMBOL)'
     Represents the value of an assembler label for data.  SYMBOL is a
     string that describes the name of the assembler label.  If it
     starts with a `*', the label is the rest of SYMBOL not including
     the `*'.  Otherwise, the label is SYMBOL, usually prefixed with
     `_'.

     The `symbol_ref' contains a mode, which is usually `Pmode'.
     Usually that is the only mode for which a symbol is directly valid.

`(label_ref LABEL)'
     Represents the value of an assembler label for code.  It contains
     one operand, an expression, which must be a `code_label' that
     appears in the instruction sequence to identify the place where
     the label should go.

     The reason for using a distinct expression type for code label
     references is so that jump optimization can distinguish them.

`(const:M EXP)'
     Represents a constant that is the result of an assembly-time
     arithmetic computation.  The operand, EXP, is an expression that
     contains only constants (`const_int', `symbol_ref' and `label_ref'
     expressions) combined with `plus' and `minus'.  However, not all
     combinations are valid, since the assembler cannot do arbitrary
     arithmetic on relocatable symbols.

     M should be `Pmode'.

`(high:M EXP)'
     Represents the high-order bits of EXP, usually a `symbol_ref'.
     The number of bits is machine-dependent and is normally the number
     of bits specified in an instruction that initializes the high
     order bits of a register.  It is used with `lo_sum' to represent
     the typical two-instruction sequence used in RISC machines to
     reference a global memory location.

     M should be `Pmode'.

Registers and Memory
====================

   Here are the RTL expression types for describing access to machine
registers and to main memory.

`(reg:M N)'
     For small values of the integer N (those that are less than
     `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'), this stands for a reference to machine
     register number N: a "hard register".  For larger values of N, it
     stands for a temporary value or "pseudo register".  The compiler's
     strategy is to generate code assuming an unlimited number of such
     pseudo registers, and later convert them into hard registers or
     into memory references.

     M is the machine mode of the reference.  It is necessary because
     machines can generally refer to each register in more than one
     mode.  For example, a register may contain a full word but there
     may be instructions to refer to it as a half word or as a single
     byte, as well as instructions to refer to it as a floating point
     number of various precisions.

     Even for a register that the machine can access in only one mode,
     the mode must always be specified.

     The symbol `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER' is defined by the machine
     description, since the number of hard registers on the machine is
     an invariant characteristic of the machine.  Note, however, that
     not all of the machine registers must be general registers.  All
     the machine registers that can be used for storage of data are
     given hard register numbers, even those that can be used only in
     certain instructions or can hold only certain types of data.

     A hard register may be accessed in various modes throughout one
     function, but each pseudo register is given a natural mode and is
     accessed only in that mode.  When it is necessary to describe an
     access to a pseudo register using a nonnatural mode, a `subreg'
     expression is used.

     A `reg' expression with a machine mode that specifies more than
     one word of data may actually stand for several consecutive
     registers.  If in addition the register number specifies a
     hardware register, then it actually represents several consecutive
     hardware registers starting with the specified one.

     Each pseudo register number used in a function's RTL code is
     represented by a unique `reg' expression.

     Some pseudo register numbers, those within the range of
     `FIRST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER' to `LAST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER' only appear
     during the RTL generation phase and are eliminated before the
     optimization phases.  These represent locations in the stack frame
     that cannot be determined until RTL generation for the function
     has been completed.  The following virtual register numbers are
     defined:

    `VIRTUAL_INCOMING_ARGS_REGNUM'
          This points to the first word of the incoming arguments
          passed on the stack.  Normally these arguments are placed
          there by the caller, but the callee may have pushed some
          arguments that were previously passed in registers.

          When RTL generation is complete, this virtual register is
          replaced by the sum of the register given by
          `ARG_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value of `FIRST_PARM_OFFSET'.

    `VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM'
          If `FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is defined, this points to
          immediately above the first variable on the stack.
          Otherwise, it points to the first variable on the stack.

          `VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM' is replaced with the sum of the
          register given by `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.

    `VIRTUAL_STACK_DYNAMIC_REGNUM'
          This points to the location of dynamically allocated memory
          on the stack immediately after the stack pointer has been
          adjusted by the amount of memory desired.

          This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register
          given by `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          `STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET'.

    `VIRTUAL_OUTGOING_ARGS_REGNUM'
          This points to the location in the stack at which outgoing
          arguments should be written when the stack is pre-pushed
          (arguments pushed using push insns should always use
          `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM').

          This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register
          given by `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          `STACK_POINTER_OFFSET'.

`(subreg:M REG WORDNUM)'
     `subreg' expressions are used to refer to a register in a machine
     mode other than its natural one, or to refer to one register of a
     multi-word `reg' that actually refers to several registers.

     Each pseudo-register has a natural mode.  If it is necessary to
     operate on it in a different mode--for example, to perform a
     fullword move instruction on a pseudo-register that contains a
     single byte--the pseudo-register must be enclosed in a `subreg'.
     In such a case, WORDNUM is zero.

     Usually M is at least as narrow as the mode of REG, in which case
     it is restricting consideration to only the bits of REG that are
     in M.

     Sometimes M is wider than the mode of REG.  These `subreg'
     expressions are often called "paradoxical".  They are used in
     cases where we want to refer to an object in a wider mode but do
     not care what value the additional bits have.  The reload pass
     ensures that paradoxical references are only made to hard
     registers.

     The other use of `subreg' is to extract the individual registers of
     a multi-register value.  Machine modes such as `DImode' and
     `TImode' can indicate values longer than a word, values which
     usually require two or more consecutive registers.  To access one
     of the registers, use a `subreg' with mode `SImode' and a WORDNUM
     that says which register.

     Storing in a non-paradoxical `subreg' has undefined results for
     bits belonging to the same word as the `subreg'.  This laxity makes
     it easier to generate efficient code for such instructions.  To
     represent an instruction that preserves all the bits outside of
     those in the `subreg', use `strict_low_part' around the `subreg'.

     The compilation parameter `WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN', if set to 1, says
     that word number zero is the most significant part; otherwise, it
     is the least significant part.

     On a few targets, `FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' disagrees with
     `WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'.  However, most parts of the compiler treat
     floating point values as if they had the same endianness as
     integer values.  This works because they handle them solely as a
     collection of integer values, with no particular numerical value.
     Only real.c and the runtime libraries care about
     `FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'.

     Between the combiner pass and the reload pass, it is possible to
     have a paradoxical `subreg' which contains a `mem' instead of a
     `reg' as its first operand.  After the reload pass, it is also
     possible to have a non-paradoxical `subreg' which contains a
     `mem'; this usually occurs when the `mem' is a stack slot which
     replaced a pseudo register.

     Note that it is not valid to access a `DFmode' value in `SFmode'
     using a `subreg'.  On some machines the most significant part of a
     `DFmode' value does not have the same format as a single-precision
     floating value.

     It is also not valid to access a single word of a multi-word value
     in a hard register when less registers can hold the value than
     would be expected from its size.  For example, some 32-bit
     machines have floating-point registers that can hold an entire
     `DFmode' value.  If register 10 were such a register `(subreg:SI
     (reg:DF 10) 1)' would be invalid because there is no way to
     convert that reference to a single machine register.  The reload
     pass prevents `subreg' expressions such as these from being formed.

     The first operand of a `subreg' expression is customarily accessed
     with the `SUBREG_REG' macro and the second operand is customarily
     accessed with the `SUBREG_WORD' macro.

`(scratch:M)'
     This represents a scratch register that will be required for the
     execution of a single instruction and not used subsequently.  It is
     converted into a `reg' by either the local register allocator or
     the reload pass.

     `scratch' is usually present inside a `clobber' operation (*note
     Side Effects::).

`(cc0)'
     This refers to the machine's condition code register.  It has no
     operands and may not have a machine mode.  There are two ways to
     use it:

        * To stand for a complete set of condition code flags.  This is
          best on most machines, where each comparison sets the entire
          series of flags.

          With this technique, `(cc0)' may be validly used in only two
          contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and
          compare instructions) and in comparison operators comparing
          against zero (`const_int' with value zero; that is to say,
          `const0_rtx').

        * To stand for a single flag that is the result of a single
          condition.  This is useful on machines that have only a
          single flag bit, and in which comparison instructions must
          specify the condition to test.

          With this technique, `(cc0)' may be validly used in only two
          contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and
          compare instructions) where the source is a comparison
          operator, and as the first operand of `if_then_else' (in a
          conditional branch).

     There is only one expression object of code `cc0'; it is the value
     of the variable `cc0_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of
     code `cc0' will return `cc0_rtx'.

     Instructions can set the condition code implicitly.  On many
     machines, nearly all instructions set the condition code based on
     the value that they compute or store.  It is not necessary to
     record these actions explicitly in the RTL because the machine
     description includes a prescription for recognizing the
     instructions that do so (by means of the macro
     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC').  *Note Condition Code::.  Only instructions
     whose sole purpose is to set the condition code, and instructions
     that use the condition code, need mention `(cc0)'.

     On some machines, the condition code register is given a register
     number and a `reg' is used instead of `(cc0)'.  This is usually the
     preferable approach if only a small subset of instructions modify
     the condition code.  Other machines store condition codes in
     general registers; in such cases a pseudo register should be used.

     Some machines, such as the Sparc and RS/6000, have two sets of
     arithmetic instructions, one that sets and one that does not set
     the condition code.  This is best handled by normally generating
     the instruction that does not set the condition code, and making a
     pattern that both performs the arithmetic and sets the condition
     code register (which would not be `(cc0)' in this case).  For
     examples, search for `addcc' and `andcc' in `sparc.md'.

`(pc)'
     This represents the machine's program counter.  It has no operands
     and may not have a machine mode.  `(pc)' may be validly used only
     in certain specific contexts in jump instructions.

     There is only one expression object of code `pc'; it is the value
     of the variable `pc_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of
     code `pc' will return `pc_rtx'.

     All instructions that do not jump alter the program counter
     implicitly by incrementing it, but there is no need to mention
     this in the RTL.

`(mem:M ADDR ALIAS)'
     This RTX represents a reference to main memory at an address
     represented by the expression ADDR.  M specifies how large a unit
     of memory is accessed. ALIAS specifies an alias set for the
     reference. In general two items are in different alias sets if
     they cannot reference the same memory address.

`(addressof:M REG)'
     This RTX represents a request for the address of register REG.
     Its mode is always `Pmode'.  If there are any `addressof'
     expressions left in the function after CSE, REG is forced into the
     stack and the `addressof' expression is replaced with a `plus'
     expression for the address of its stack slot.

RTL Expressions for Arithmetic
==============================

   Unless otherwise specified, all the operands of arithmetic
expressions must be valid for mode M.  An operand is valid for mode M
if it has mode M, or if it is a `const_int' or `const_double' and M is
a mode of class `MODE_INT'.

   For commutative binary operations, constants should be placed in the
second operand.

`(plus:M X Y)'
     Represents the sum of the values represented by X and Y carried
     out in machine mode M.

`(lo_sum:M X Y)'
     Like `plus', except that it represents that sum of X and the
     low-order bits of Y.  The number of low order bits is
     machine-dependent but is normally the number of bits in a `Pmode'
     item minus the number of bits set by the `high' code (*note
     Constants::).

     M should be `Pmode'.

`(minus:M X Y)'
     Like `plus' but represents subtraction.

`(ss_plus:M X Y)'
     Like `plus', but using signed saturation in case of an overflow.

`(us_plus:M X Y)'
     Like `plus', but using unsigned saturation in case of an overflow.

`(ss_minus:M X Y)'
     Like `minus', but using signed saturation in case of an overflow.

`(us_minus:M X Y)'
     Like `minus', but using unsigned saturation in case of an overflow.

`(compare:M X Y)'
     Represents the result of subtracting Y from X for purposes of
     comparison.  The result is computed without overflow, as if with
     infinite precision.

     Of course, machines can't really subtract with infinite precision.
     However, they can pretend to do so when only the sign of the
     result will be used, which is the case when the result is stored
     in the condition code.   And that is the only way this kind of
     expression may validly be used: as a value to be stored in the
     condition codes.

     The mode M is not related to the modes of X and Y, but instead is
     the mode of the condition code value.  If `(cc0)' is used, it is
     `VOIDmode'.  Otherwise it is some mode in class `MODE_CC', often
     `CCmode'.  *Note Condition Code::.

     Normally, X and Y must have the same mode.  Otherwise, `compare'
     is valid only if the mode of X is in class `MODE_INT' and Y is a
     `const_int' or `const_double' with mode `VOIDmode'.  The mode of X
     determines what mode the comparison is to be done in; thus it must
     not be `VOIDmode'.

     If one of the operands is a constant, it should be placed in the
     second operand and the comparison code adjusted as appropriate.

     A `compare' specifying two `VOIDmode' constants is not valid since
     there is no way to know in what mode the comparison is to be
     performed; the comparison must either be folded during the
     compilation or the first operand must be loaded into a register
     while its mode is still known.

`(neg:M X)'
     Represents the negation (subtraction from zero) of the value
     represented by X, carried out in mode M.

`(mult:M X Y)'
     Represents the signed product of the values represented by X and Y
     carried out in machine mode M.

     Some machines support a multiplication that generates a product
     wider than the operands.  Write the pattern for this as

          (mult:M (sign_extend:M X) (sign_extend:M Y))

     where M is wider than the modes of X and Y, which need not be the
     same.

     Write patterns for unsigned widening multiplication similarly using
     `zero_extend'.

`(div:M X Y)'
     Represents the quotient in signed division of X by Y, carried out
     in machine mode M.  If M is a floating point mode, it represents
     the exact quotient; otherwise, the integerized quotient.

     Some machines have division instructions in which the operands and
     quotient widths are not all the same; you should represent such
     instructions using `truncate' and `sign_extend' as in,

          (truncate:M1 (div:M2 X (sign_extend:M2 Y)))

`(udiv:M X Y)'
     Like `div' but represents unsigned division.

`(mod:M X Y)'
`(umod:M X Y)'
     Like `div' and `udiv' but represent the remainder instead of the
     quotient.

`(smin:M X Y)'
`(smax:M X Y)'
     Represents the smaller (for `smin') or larger (for `smax') of X
     and Y, interpreted as signed integers in mode M.

`(umin:M X Y)'
`(umax:M X Y)'
     Like `smin' and `smax', but the values are interpreted as unsigned
     integers.

`(not:M X)'
     Represents the bitwise complement of the value represented by X,
     carried out in mode M, which must be a fixed-point machine mode.

`(and:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise logical-and of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     machine mode.

`(ior:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise inclusive-or of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     mode.

`(xor:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise exclusive-or of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     mode.

`(ashift:M X C)'
     Represents the result of arithmetically shifting X left by C
     places.  X have mode M, a fixed-point machine mode.  C be a
     fixed-point mode or be a constant with mode `VOIDmode'; which mode
     is determined by the mode called for in the machine description
     entry for the left-shift instruction.  For example, on the Vax,
     the mode of C is `QImode' regardless of M.

`(lshiftrt:M X C)'
`(ashiftrt:M X C)'
     Like `ashift' but for right shift.  Unlike the case for left shift,
     these two operations are distinct.

`(rotate:M X C)'
`(rotatert:M X C)'
     Similar but represent left and right rotate.  If C is a constant,
     use `rotate'.

`(abs:M X)'
     Represents the absolute value of X, computed in mode M.

`(sqrt:M X)'
     Represents the square root of X, computed in mode M.  Most often M
     will be a floating point mode.

`(ffs:M X)'
     Represents one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit in X,
     represented as an integer of mode M.  (The value is zero if X is
     zero.)  The mode of X need not be M; depending on the target
     machine, various mode combinations may be valid.

Comparison Operations
=====================

   Comparison operators test a relation on two operands and are
considered to represent a machine-dependent nonzero value described by,
but not necessarily equal to, `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::) if the
relation holds, or zero if it does not.  The mode of the comparison
operation is independent of the mode of the data being compared.  If
the comparison operation is being tested (e.g., the first operand of an
`if_then_else'), the mode must be `VOIDmode'.  If the comparison
operation is producing data to be stored in some variable, the mode
must be in class `MODE_INT'.  All comparison operations producing data
must use the same mode, which is machine-specific.

   There are two ways that comparison operations may be used.  The
comparison operators may be used to compare the condition codes `(cc0)'
against zero, as in `(eq (cc0) (const_int 0))'.  Such a construct
actually refers to the result of the preceding instruction in which the
condition codes were set.  The instruction setting the condition code
must be adjacent to the instruction using the condition code; only
`note' insns may separate them.

   Alternatively, a comparison operation may directly compare two data
objects.  The mode of the comparison is determined by the operands; they
must both be valid for a common machine mode.  A comparison with both
operands constant would be invalid as the machine mode could not be
deduced from it, but such a comparison should never exist in RTL due to
constant folding.

   In the example above, if `(cc0)' were last set to `(compare X Y)',
the comparison operation is identical to `(eq X Y)'.  Usually only one
style of comparisons is supported on a particular machine, but the
combine pass will try to merge the operations to produce the `eq' shown
in case it exists in the context of the particular insn involved.

   Inequality comparisons come in two flavors, signed and unsigned.
Thus, there are distinct expression codes `gt' and `gtu' for signed and
unsigned greater-than.  These can produce different results for the same
pair of integer values: for example, 1 is signed greater-than -1 but not
unsigned greater-than, because -1 when regarded as unsigned is actually
`0xffffffff' which is greater than 1.

   The signed comparisons are also used for floating point values.
Floating point comparisons are distinguished by the machine modes of
the operands.

`(eq:M X Y)'
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the values represented by X and Y are equal,
     otherwise 0.

`(ne:M X Y)'
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the values represented by X and Y are not
     equal, otherwise 0.

`(gt:M X Y)'
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the X is greater than Y.  If they are
     fixed-point, the comparison is done in a signed sense.

`(gtu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' but does unsigned comparison, on fixed-point numbers
     only.

`(lt:M X Y)'
`(ltu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "less than".

`(ge:M X Y)'
`(geu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "greater than or equal".

`(le:M X Y)'
`(leu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "less than or equal".

`(if_then_else COND THEN ELSE)'
     This is not a comparison operation but is listed here because it is
     always used in conjunction with a comparison operation.  To be
     precise, COND is a comparison expression.  This expression
     represents a choice, according to COND, between the value
     represented by THEN and the one represented by ELSE.

     On most machines, `if_then_else' expressions are valid only to
     express conditional jumps.

`(cond [TEST1 VALUE1 TEST2 VALUE2 ...] DEFAULT)'
     Similar to `if_then_else', but more general.  Each of TEST1,
     TEST2, ... is performed in turn.  The result of this expression is
     the VALUE corresponding to the first non-zero test, or DEFAULT if
     none of the tests are non-zero expressions.

     This is currently not valid for instruction patterns and is
     supported only for insn attributes.  *Note Insn Attributes::.

Bit-Fields
==========

   Special expression codes exist to represent bit-field instructions.
These types of expressions are lvalues in RTL; they may appear on the
left side of an assignment, indicating insertion of a value into the
specified bit-field.

`(sign_extract:M LOC SIZE POS)'
     This represents a reference to a sign-extended bit-field contained
     or starting in LOC (a memory or register reference).  The bit-field
     is SIZE bits wide and starts at bit POS.  The compilation option
     `BITS_BIG_ENDIAN' says which end of the memory unit POS counts
     from.

     If LOC is in memory, its mode must be a single-byte integer mode.
     If LOC is in a register, the mode to use is specified by the
     operand of the `insv' or `extv' pattern (*note Standard Names::)
     and is usually a full-word integer mode, which is the default if
     none is specified.

     The mode of POS is machine-specific and is also specified in the
     `insv' or `extv' pattern.

     The mode M is the same as the mode that would be used for LOC if
     it were a register.

`(zero_extract:M LOC SIZE POS)'
     Like `sign_extract' but refers to an unsigned or zero-extended
     bit-field.  The same sequence of bits are extracted, but they are
     filled to an entire word with zeros instead of by sign-extension.

Vector Operations
=================

   All normal rtl expressions can be used with vector modes; they are
interpreted as operating on each part of the vector independently.
Additionally, there are a few new expressions to describe specific
vector operations.

`(vec_merge:M VEC1 VEC2 ITEMS)'
     This describes a merge operation between two vectors.  The result
     is a vector of mode M; its elements are selected from either VEC1
     or VEC2.  Which elements are selected is described by ITEMS, which
     is a bit mask represented by a `const_int'; a zero bit indicates
     the corresponding element in the result vector is taken from VEC2
     while a set bit indicates it is taken from VEC1.

`(vec_select:M VEC1 SELECTION)'
     This describes an operation that selects parts of a vector.  VEC1
     is the source vector, SELECTION is a `parallel' that contains a
     `const_int' for each of the subparts of the result vector, giving
     the number of the source subpart that should be stored into it.

`(vec_concat:M VEC1 VEC2)'
     Describes a vector concat operation.  The result is a
     concatenation of the vectors VEC1 and VEC2; its length is the sum
     of the lengths of the two inputs.

`(vec_const:M SUBPARTS)'
     This describes a constant vector.  SUBPARTS is a `parallel' that
     contains a constant for each of the subparts of the vector.

`(vec_duplicate:M VEC)'
     This operation converts a small vector into a larger one by
     duplicating the input values.  The output vector mode must have
     the same submodes as the input vector mode, and the number of
     output parts must be an integer multiple of the number of input
     parts.

Conversions
===========

   All conversions between machine modes must be represented by
explicit conversion operations.  For example, an expression which is
the sum of a byte and a full word cannot be written as `(plus:SI
(reg:QI 34) (reg:SI 80))' because the `plus' operation requires two
operands of the same machine mode.  Therefore, the byte-sized operand
is enclosed in a conversion operation, as in

     (plus:SI (sign_extend:SI (reg:QI 34)) (reg:SI 80))

   The conversion operation is not a mere placeholder, because there
may be more than one way of converting from a given starting mode to
the desired final mode.  The conversion operation code says how to do
it.

   For all conversion operations, X must not be `VOIDmode' because the
mode in which to do the conversion would not be known.  The conversion
must either be done at compile-time or X must be placed into a register.

`(sign_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of sign-extending the value X to machine
     mode M.  M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of
     a mode narrower than M.

`(zero_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of zero-extending the value X to machine
     mode M.  M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of
     a mode narrower than M.

`(float_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of extending the value X to machine mode M.
     M must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a
     mode narrower than M.

`(truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.
     M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of a mode
     wider than M.

`(ss_truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M,
     using signed saturation in the case of overflow.  Both M and the
     mode of X must be fixed-point modes.

`(us_truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M,
     using unsigned saturation in the case of overflow.  Both M and the
     mode of X must be fixed-point modes.

`(float_truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.
     M must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a
     mode wider than M.

`(float:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded
     as signed, to floating point mode M.

`(unsigned_float:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded
     as unsigned, to floating point mode M.

`(fix:M X)'
     When M is a fixed point mode, represents the result of converting
     floating point value X to mode M, regarded as signed.  How
     rounding is done is not specified, so this operation may be used
     validly in compiling C code only for integer-valued operands.

`(unsigned_fix:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting floating point value X to
     fixed point mode M, regarded as unsigned.  How rounding is done is
     not specified.

`(fix:M X)'
     When M is a floating point mode, represents the result of
     converting floating point value X (valid for mode M) to an
     integer, still represented in floating point mode M, by rounding
     towards zero.

Declarations
============

   Declaration expression codes do not represent arithmetic operations
but rather state assertions about their operands.

`(strict_low_part (subreg:M (reg:N R) 0))'
     This expression code is used in only one context: as the
     destination operand of a `set' expression.  In addition, the
     operand of this expression must be a non-paradoxical `subreg'
     expression.

     The presence of `strict_low_part' says that the part of the
     register which is meaningful in mode N, but is not part of mode M,
     is not to be altered.  Normally, an assignment to such a subreg is
     allowed to have undefined effects on the rest of the register when
     M is less than a word.
