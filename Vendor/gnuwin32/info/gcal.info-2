Fixed date options
..................

`-v ARGUMENT'
`--date-variable=ARGUMENT'
     Define "global" date variable which is visible in all referenced
     resource files (*note Date variables::).  The option ARGUMENT must
     either be a valid single date variable definition or a (`:')
     colon-connected series of definitions.

     A date variable name DVAR consists of a single, case-insensitive
     letter(1) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-1::).  In a
     definition, this name is trailed by the assignment operator
     character `=', and the numerical values of month MM (or a short,
     three characters month name, e.g. `Jan', `Feb'...)  and day DD,
     this variable has to store(2) (*note Fixed date
     options-Footnote-2::).

     For example:

          `--date-variable=a=1127:c=a' respectively
          `-v a=1127:c=a'
          stores the 27th November into the global date variable A and
          into the global date variable C.

`--export-date-variables'
     Causes the export of local date variables from one resource file
     to another resource file.  *Note Date variables::, for more
     details.

`-r ARGUMENT'
`--text-variable=ARGUMENT'
     Define "global" text variable which is visible in all referenced
     resource files (*note Text variables::).  The option ARGUMENT must
     either be a valid single text variable definition or a (`:')
     colon-connected series of definitions.

     A text variable name TVAR consists of the `$' prefix and a single,
     case-insensitive letter.

     A text variable is defined as follows:

        * If the name of a text variable is trailed by the assignment
          operator character `=', all the text which appears at the
          right side of this assignment operator is assigned to this
          text variable.

        * If the name of a text variable is trailed by the assignment
          operator character `?', all the text which appears at the
          right side of this assignment operator is assumed as an
          external command and executed by Gcal.  The output, which is
          created on the _standard output channel_ by the command run,
          is assigned to this text variable; and that in an interpreted
          manner.  This means, Gcal interprets all special texts and
          references to other text variables which are contained in
          this output.  *Note Text variables::, and *Note Special Texts
          processed::, for further information.

        * If the name of a text variable is trailed by the assignment
          operator character `:', all the text which appears at the
          right side of this assignment operator is assumed as an
          external command and executed by Gcal.  The output, which is
          created on the _standard output channel_ by the command run,
          is assigned to this text variable; and that in an
          uninterpreted manner.  This means, Gcal does not interpret
          any special texts and references to other text variables
          which are contained in this output.  See also *Note Text
          variables::, and *Note Special Texts processed::, for further
          details.

     Indeed, Gcal executes external commands only if the
     `--execute-command' option is given at program start-up.  *Note
     Fixed date option `--execute-command': x-execute-command, for more
     details.

     The text which appears at the right side of one of the valid
     assignment operator characters may reference names of already
     defined global text variables.  These references are converted to
     the according textual values just before the assignment is
     performed by Gcal.

     A global text variable is defined with an _empty contents_ in case
     no text appears at the right side of one of the valid assignment
     operator characters.

     For example:

          `--text-variable=$a=foo:$c=$a' respectively
          `-r $a=foo:$c=$a'
          stores the `foo' text into the global text variable $A and
          into the global text variable $C.

          `--text-variable=$a\:foo:$c?bar' respectively
          `-r $a\:foo:$c?bar'
          stores the uninterpreted output of the `foo' command into the
          global text variable $A, and the interpreted output of the
          `bar' command into the global text variable $C.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the `:' separator
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     `\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. `\:'.  If you need the
     `\:' characters themselves, you have to protect the `\'
     (backslash) character by another `\' (backslash) character, e.g.
     `\\:'.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the `$' prefix character
     --in case this character itself is needed in the text-- by placing
     a `\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. `\$'.  If you need the
     `\$' characters themselves in the text, you have to protect the
     `\' (backslash) character by another `\' (backslash) character,
     e.g. `\\$'.

     Each time a `_' (underscore) character is found in ARGUMENT, this
     character is replaced by a real ` ' (space) character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the `_' (underscore)
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     `\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. `\_'.  If you need the
     `\_' themselves, you have to protect the `\' (backslash) character
     by another `\' (backslash) character, e.g. `\\_'.

`--export-text-variables'
     Causes the export of local text variables from one resource file
     to another resource file.  *Note Text variables::, for more
     details.

`--adjust-value=ARGUMENT'
     Causes on the one hand, that the number given as ARGUMENT to the
     `--adjust-value' option is used as reference altitude to calculate
     the rise and set times by the Sun and Moon oriented special texts.
     The option argument must be a rational number in range
     -90.0...+90.0, which declares the angle distance in decimal
     degrees from the center of astronomical object to the horizon.
     For example, you can detect the time when the center of the Sun or
     the Moon is 20.5 decimal degrees below the horizon if you use
     `--adjust-value=-20.5'.

     And causes on the other hand, that the number that is given as
     ARGUMENT is used as factor for computing the shadow length of a
     vertical pole by the Sun oriented special texts.  The option
     argument must be a rational number in range 0.0...+90.0, which
     declares the shadow length.  For example, you can detect the time
     when the shadow length of vertical pole is three and a half times
     longer than the shadow length that appears at astronomical noon if
     you use `--adjust-value=3.5'.

     *Note Sun data::, and *Note Moon data::, for further information.

`--atmosphere=AIR-PRESSURE[,TEMPERATURE]'
     Set the base data of the Earth's atmosphere that is necessary to
     calculate the amount of "refraction"(3) (*note Fixed date
     options-Footnote-3::), that is used by the Sun and Moon oriented
     special texts.  The option argument consists of one or two
     rational numbers, which are separated by a `,' character.  The
     first number denotes the air pressure in millibar, and the second
     number specifies the air temperature in degree Celsius.  The
     default value for the air pressure is 1013.25 millibar, and the
     default value for the temperature is 15.0 degree Celsius.  For
     example, if you use `--atmosphere=1010,10', you define atmospheric
     conditions as they are existing for an air pressure of 1010
     millibar and a temperature of 10 degree Celsius.  If you set an
     air pressure value less or equal zero, no atmospheric refraction
     will be respected by the Sun and Moon oriented special texts, as
     for example done by `--atmosphere=0'.

     *Note Sun data::, and *Note Moon data::, for further information.

`--limit'
     Causes when calculating the rise and set times by the Sun oriented
     special texts for high latitudes, that a rise or set event which
     possibly occurs on a previous or next day, is not displayed as
     occurring on the actual day as it is done by default.  At high
     latitudes, i.e. above the solar Arctic Circle, it is fact that no,
     or more than one sunrise or sunset happens during a day at
     definite dates of the year.  As a special text basically leads in a
     single, atomical output, even it should result in several output
     in reality, Gcal puts such an event on a previous or next day.
     Then, data represented in this manner could be misinterpreted very
     easily.

     The following example is used to explain this.  It calculates the
     time the astronomical twilight ends for the location Münster,
     Germany, during some days in May 2000, and that with and without
     the `--limit' option in each case:

          $ gcal %20000506 -f/dev/null -cxl4+ \
          >      -#'0*d1#999_%s9+5158+00738,120'
          -|
          -| Sun, May   7th 2000: 23:52
          -| Mon, May   8th 2000: 23:57
          -| Tue, May   9th 2000: 00:01
          -| Wed, May  10th 2000: 00:06
          $ gcal %20000506 -f/dev/null -cxl4+ --limit \
          >      -#'0*d1#999_%s9+5158+00738,120'
          -|
          -| Sun, May   7th 2000: 23:52
          -| Mon, May   8th 2000: 23:57
          -| Tue, May   9th 2000: **:**
          -| Wed, May  10th 2000: **:**

     As one can see well in the above example, the output for the days
     since 9th May differs in that the times shown without the
     `--limit' option obviously exceeded the civil midnight time and
     actually cannot happen during these days, whereas no times are
     shown for the days since 9th May if the `--limit' option is used
     because the time circle is exceeded.  Astronomically seen, it is
     the case that the end of the astronomical twilight is at 23:57
     o'clock local time on 8th May, no end of astronomical twilight
     happens on 9th May because the center of the Sun's disk is always
     above 18 degrees (the reference altitude of the astronomical
     twilight) below a geometric horizon, but on 10th May at 00:01
     o'clock local time, this reference altitude is passed again.
     Thus, the time that is detected for the 9th May has properly to be
     moved to the 10th May, et cetera, as it is expressed by the output
     that is created by using the `--limit' option.

     *Note Sun data::, for further information.

`--cycle-end=ARGUMENT'
     Calculates the Sun and Moon oriented special texts that are
     dynamical, i.e. depending on the respective clocktime, for a
     series of clocktimes for the current day, i.e. determination is
     done for any time interval that can be individually defined by the
     user.  Gcal is always put into such a "cycle mode" if the
     `--cycle-end' option is given at program start-up.  The ARGUMENT
     of the `--cycle-end' option is syntactically according to the
     argument which may be given to the `--time-offset' option, thus
     `t|@|[t|@][+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]'.  *Note Calendar option
     `--time-offset=ARGUMENT': x-time-offset, for the detailed
     explanation of the preceding option argument.  Thus, the
     `--cycle-end' option is used to fix the ending time of the time
     interval, whereas the `--time-offset' option is *implicitly* used
     to fix the starting time of the time interval, that is 0 o'clock
     by default(4) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-4::).

     If values for the time interval are given to both above mentioned
     options that fall short of 0 o'clock, these values are
     automatically set to 0 o'clock.  If values for the time interval
     are given that exceed 23:39 o'clock, these values are
     automatically set to 23:59 o'clock.

     The timestep value between the starting and the ending time of the
     time interval that is respected by Gcal is one minute by default.
     This value can at pleasure be changed by using the `--cycle-step'
     option.  *Note Fixed date option `--cycle-step=ARGUMENT':
     x-cycle-step, for more details.

     You should always keep in mind that the use of the cycle mode is
     efficient only if the current time of the time interval is also
     part of that resource file line that has to be evaluated in this
     manner.  Otherwise, it is difficult to find out unobjectionably
     lateron when displaying the data and times, which Sun or Moon
     oriented value resulted in what time.

     The following example shows how the topocentric elevation angle of
     the Sun for the location Münster, Germany, is calculated during
     two days in April 2000, and that for the time interval 12:00
     o'clock until 12:05 o'clock local time in each case:

     *Note Sun data::, and *Note Moon data::, for further information.

`--cycle-step=ARGUMENT'
     Changes the timestep value that is used between the starting and
     ending clocktime of the time interval, in which the Sun and Moon
     oriented special texts are calculated, that are dynamical, i.e.
     depending on the respective clocktime.  *Note Fixed date option
     `--cycle-end=ARGUMENT': x-cycle-end, how to define such a time
     interval.  Without the `--cycle-end' option, a `--cycle-step'
     option is completely ignored.  It also does not enable Gcal's
     cycle mode.  The ARGUMENT of the `--cycle-step' option is by
     change syntactically according to the argument which may be given
     to the `--time-offset' option, and that relative time offset value
     references based on the actual local time and Universal time
     cannot be made, respectively.  Gcal always uses the amount of the
     given timestep value.  Thus, the template for the argument that
     may be given to the `--cycle-step' option is `[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]'.
     *Note Calendar option `--time-offset=ARGUMENT': x-time-offset, for
     the detailed explanation of the preceding option argument.

     The timestep value between the starting and the ending time of the
     time interval that is respected by Gcal is one minute by default.

     the Sun for the location Münster, Germany, is calculated during

`--precise'
     The astronomical data and times that are created by the Sun and
     Moon oriented special texts, and the geographical data that is
     created by the distance and course angle oriented special text,
     respectively, are displayed by using a higher precision, i.e.
     according to the mode or style of representation and the type of
     special text, decimal values are displayed with more decimal
     places, or output of the time seconds part or the arcseconds part.

     *Note Sun data::, and *Note Moon data::, likewise *Note
     Geographical distance and course angle::, for further information.

`--execute-command'
     Causes on the one hand, that shell command `%![ARGUMENT]' special
     texts are executed, and not displayed textually only.  *Note Shell
     command `%![ARGUMENT]' special text: Shell Command, for more
     details.  And causes on the other hand, that `TVAR?[COMMAND]' and
     `TVAR:[COMMAND]' text variable definitions is assigned the output
     of an external command, and not the text which contains the call
     of the external command.  *Note Text variables::, for further
     information.

`-D ARGUMENT'
`--filter-day=ARGUMENT'
     Displays only those fixed dates, whose date is not excluded by the
     given ARGUMENT.  *Note Date part of a line::, and likewise *Note
     Exclusions without any argument `%?' special texts: Exclusions
     without any argument.  The ARGUMENT consists of one or more
     characters as used in the exclusion without any argument `%?'
     special text; but without the leading `%' character in each case.

     For example, it is possible to induce Gcal to display only those
     fixed dates from the resource file `demo.rc' for the whole year
     which are legals holidays, and moreover, Saturdays or Sundays:

          gcal -f demo.rc --year --filter-day=Rv

`-P ARGUMENT'
`--filter-period=ARGUMENT'
     Displays only those fixed dates, whose date is not excluded by the
     given ARGUMENT.  *Note Date part of a line::, and likewise *Note
     Exclusions with date argument `%?[DATE]' special texts: Exclusions
     with date argument.  The ARGUMENT consists of one or more
     expressions as used in the exclusion with date argument `%?[DATE]'
     special text; but without the leading `%' character in each case.
     You can use more than one of these `%?[DATE]' expressions by
     connecting them with a `,' character.

     For example, it is possible to induce Gcal to display only those
     fixed dates from the resource file `demo.rc' for the whole year
     which appear within the period of the 17th and the 20th of any
     month, and which appear on the 31st of any month.

          gcal -f demo.rc -y -P i00000017#00000020,i00000031#00000031

`-I PATTERN'
`--filter-text=PATTERN'
     Displays only those fixed dates, whose completely expanded text(5)
     (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-5::) is matched by the given
     PATTERN.  *Note Text part of a line::, and *Note `%?'... special
     texts for text replacement: Replacements.  The PATTERN is a
     _regular expression_, as recognized by the Unix `ed' line-editor.
     *Note Regular Expressions::, for further information.

     For example, it is possible to induce Gcal to display all fixed
     dates from the resource file `doctor.rc' for the current month,
     which are defined for dentists or oculists:

          gcal -f doctor.rc --month -I "[dD]entist|[oO]culist"

     Each time a `_' (underscore) character is found in the PATTERN
     argument, this character is replaced by a real ` ' (space)
     character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the `_' (underscore)
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     `\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. `\_'.  If you need the
     `\_' characters themselves, you have to protect the `\'
     (backslash) character by another `\' (backslash) character, e.g.
     `\\_'.

`--ignore-case'
     Ignores all case distinctions in both the completely expanded text
     and the PATTERN of the `--filter-text=PATTERN' option.  *Note
     Fixed date option `--filter-text=PATTERN': x-filter-text.

`--revert-match'
     Displays all those fixed dates, whose completely expanded text
     does not match the PATTERN of the `--filter-text=PATTERN' option.
     *Note Fixed date option `--filter-text=PATTERN': x-filter-text.

`-c|C[-]'
`--today'
`--list-of-fixed-dates[=short|long]'
`--descending-fixed-dates[=short|long]'
     Activate the fixed date function and display fixed date messages,
     if any.

    `-c'
    `--today'
    `--list-of-fixed-dates=short'
          Activate fixed date function (use standard resource file
          implicitly) and list all dates related to the actual system
          date (==today), sorted in ascending order.  If no fixed dates
          related to the current day are found, no fixed date messages
          are displayed and the program is terminated with an error
          code.  *Note Error Code 1: x-1-Error-code.

    `-c-'
    `--descending-fixed-dates=short'
          Activate fixed date function (use standard resource file
          implicitly) and list all dates related to the actual system
          date (==today), sorted in descending order.  If no fixed
          dates related to the current day are found, no fixed date
          messages are displayed and the program is terminated with an
          error code.  *Note Error Code 1: x-1-Error-code.

    `-C'
    `--list-of-fixed-dates=long'
          Activate fixed date function (use standard resource file
          implicitly) and list all dates related to the actual system
          date (==today), sorted in ascending order.  If no fixed dates
          related to the current day are found, an "empty" fixed date
          message is displayed which is only consisting of the date.

    `-C-'
    `--descending-fixed-dates=long'
          Activate fixed date function (use standard resource file
          implicitly) and list all dates related to the actual system
          date (==today), sorted in descending order.  If no fixed
          dates related to the current day are found, an "empty" fixed
          date message is displayed which is only consisting of the
          date.

`-f|F NAME[+...]'
`--resource-file=NAME[+...]'
     Activate fixed date function and use file NAME instead of the
     standard resource file.  Then list all dates, sorted in ascending
     order which occur in the fixed date period.  If no other fixed
     date period is specified, the actual system date (==today) is used
     for the fixed date period.  If the option letter `f' of the
     short-style option is used and no dates related to the fixed date
     period are found in NAME, no fixed date messages are displayed and
     the program is terminated with an error code.  *Note Error Code 1:
     x-1-Error-code.  If the option letter `F' of the short-style
     option is used and no dates related to the fixed date period are
     found in NAME, an "empty" fixed date message is displayed which is
     only consisting of the date.

     You can use more than one resource file NAME by connecting them
     with a `+' character, e.g.:

          `--resource-file=./foo+xyz+/data/bar+$HOME/.gcalrc' resp.,
          `-f ./foo+xyz+/data/bar+$HOME/.gcalrc'

     respects all files given in the preceding argument by using a
     special file search mechanism.  *Note File searching mechanism:
     x-File-searching-mechanism, for more details.  Use `/dev/null' to
     avoid the use of the standard resource file, useful for creating
     _empty fixed date lists_.  If a single `-' character is given as
     file NAME, like `--resource-file=./foo+-+xyz' or `-F-', but not
     `-F -', Gcal reads and processes all input received from the
     _standard input channel_.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the `+' separator
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     `\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. `\+'.  If you need the
     `\+' characters themselves, you have to protect the `\'
     (backslash) character by another `\' (backslash) character, e.g.
     `\\+'.

     Each time a `_' (underscore) character is found in NAME, this
     character is replaced by a real ` ' (space) character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the `_' (underscore)
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     `\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. `\_'.  If you need the
     `\_' characters themselves, you have to protect the `\'
     (backslash) character by another `\' (backslash) character, e.g.
     `\\_'.

`-# LINE'
`--here=LINE'
     Activate fixed date function and use the LINE argument together
     with the standard resource file respectively additional resource
     files.  The LINE argument has to be a valid line as it may occur
     in a Gcal resource file (*note Structure of resource file::), and
     is always evaluated last *after* the processing of all resource
     files, so dealing with references to exported local date or text
     variables is enabled.  This option may be given multiple and it
     will be processed exactly in the given order.  All dates are
     listed, sorted in ascending order which occur in the fixed date
     period.  If no other fixed date period is specified, the actual
     system date (==today) is used for the fixed date period.  If no
     dates related to the fixed date period are found in the LINE, no
     fixed date messages are displayed and the program is terminated
     with an error code.  *Note Error Code 1: x-1-Error-code.

     For example, the call:

          gcal -# "0*d1su#99su.7 ^%Z" --here="#include <foo>" -y

     causes the implicit processing of the standard resource file just
     before the further resource file line `0*d1su#99su.7 ^%Z' and
     following `#include <foo>' are processed, and that as if these
     lines were a physical part of the standard resource file.

     Each time a `_' (underscore) character is found in LINE, this
     character is replaced by a real ` ' (space) character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the `_' (underscore)
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     `\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. `\_'.  If you need the
     `\_' characters themselves, you have to protect the `\'
     (backslash) character by another `\' (backslash) character, e.g.
     `\\_'.

*Please note:*
If the short-style option `-c' and/or its modifiers `t|[w|m|y[+|-]', or
the short-style option `-f' is/are given in *upper-case*, e.g.:

     -C
     -F foo.bar
     -CeT
     -c-aW+
     -CeaxY-
     -c-M

Gcal displays fixed date messages for *every* day of the requested
period.

  The modifiers of a combined/complex/packed short-style fixed date
option must be constructed according to following steps, because Gcal
treats them as positional parameters:

    First step: _Representation-of-text-modifier_
          `a', `A', `e|E', `J', `k', `o', `Q', `U', `x', `z', `Z'

    Second step: _Period-of-fixed-dates-modifier_
          `d', `l', `t|T', `w|W|m|M|y|Y[+|-]', `N+|-', `Nd', `Nw',
          `*dN[WWW]', `*wN[WWW]', `@e|t|DVAR[[+|-]N]',
          `@e|t|DVAR[+|-]NWWW', `MMDD', `MMWWWN'

  If you want to operate with the preceding modifiers, an *explicit*
`-c|C[-]' short-style option must be leading on the one hand, e.g.:

     -c-t
     -cw-
     -CZdekloQUzJaxA12+

and only *one* period defining fixed date period modifier may be
given(6) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-6::).

Or on the other hand, the modifiers must be given as single character
options or composed into a single command line word, and additionally
either the short-style option `-c|C[-]', `-f|F NAME[+...]' or
`-# LINE'(7) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-7::) must be given like:

     -c -t
     -w- -c
     -a -Ad -e -kloQUxz -C12+
     -F foo.bar -dJZA -l*d10
     --here="; Comment" -dZAa

If the modifiers are given as single character options or composed into
a single command line word, and one of the `t|T|[w|W|m|M|y|Y[+|-]]'
modifiers is used(8) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-8::), it is
unnecessary to give a `-c|C[-]' respectively `-f|F NAME[+...]'
short-style option(9) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-9::) to
activate the fixed date function of Gcal, because it is triggered
implicitly by means of these modifiers / alias names.

  *Note Coding Scheme::, whose tables explain the relations between the
_date part_ (YYYY...) of a resource file line and the modifiers, the
short-style option `-c|C[]' --which is used for enabling the fixed date
feature-- respectively the long-style option
`--period-of-fixed-dates=ARGUMENT' may have, i.e. they point out all
possible correspondences.  This is necessary because Gcal does not
respect all entries found in a resource file if a _fixed date_ argument
is given, it respects only those entries which have a definite relation
to the _fixed date_ argument to avoid the output of redundant
information!

*Fixed date text modifiers and options:*

`--biorhythm-axis=NUMBER'
     The width of the biorhythm text graphics --which can be created by
     means of the biorhythm text graphics `%;[DATE]' special text-- is
     changed to NUMBER characters for each axis of the bar.  The NUMBER
     argument must be an integer value between 1...100, the default
     number of characters is 20.  If the NUMBER divides 100 with a
     remainder, it is internally reduced to the nearest number that
     divides 100 without any remainder.  This means, only the numbers
     1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 and 100 are factually respected, so a
     NUMBER argument of 19 is internally reduced to 10.

     For example:

          $ cat bio.rc
          -| 0*d1#999 %;19620921
          $ gcal -fbio.rc %19961212 -s0 -xw --biorhythm-axis=19
          -|
          -| Thu, Dec <12th>1996: 0- I       P1 E        +0
          -| Fri, Dec  13th 1996: 0-  I   P   1          +0
          -| Sat, Dec  14th 1996: 0-    @   E 0          +0
          -| Sun, Dec  15th 1996: 0-  P  IE   0          +0
          -| Mon, Dec  16th 1996: 0- P  E  I  0          +0
          -| Tue, Dec  17th 1996: 1-P  E     I0          +0
          -| Wed, Dec  18th 1996: 0- @        1          +0

     *Note Biorhythm `%?[DATE]' special texts: Biorhythm, for more
     details.

`--moonimage-lines=NUMBER'
     The height of the Moon phase text graphics --which can be created
     by means of the Moon phase text graphics `%Z[DATE]' special text--
     is changed to NUMBER lines.  The NUMBER argument must be an integer
     value between 6...30, the default number of lines is 12.

     For example:

          $ gcal -f/dev/null -#0*d1#999_%Z__%O %19950407 -x --moon=8
          -|
          -| Fri, Apr < 7th>1995:          (    @@@@@

     *Note Moon phase `%[FORMAT]?[DATE]' special texts: Moon phase, for
     more details.

`a'
`--include-resource-file-name'
     Extend fixed date text by the name of the resource file and the
     line number which the fixed date text comes from, e.g.:

          Mon, Jan   1st 1995: (`Eternal holiday list'#00003) New Year's day
          Mon, Jan   1st 1995: (.gcalrc#00987) No fixed dates
          ...

`A'
`--alternative-format'
     Instead of using the "standard" list format, e.g.:

          Mon, Jan   1st 1995: New Year's day
          Mon, Jan   1st 1995: No fixed dates
          ...

     Gcal uses the "alternative" list format, e.g.:

          Mon, Jan   1st 1995:
          New Year's day
          No fixed dates
          ...

`e'
`--include-holidays=long'
     Enable inclusion of all built-in eternal holiday dates.  This
     includes legal holidays and memorial days.

`E'
`--include-holidays=short'
     Enable inclusion of those built-in eternal holiday dates which are
     legal holidays only.

`g[TEXT]'
`--grouping-text[=TEXT]'
     Group fixed dates by day by using the TEXT separator.  If TEXT is
     not given, the built-in TEXT(10) (*note Fixed date
     options-Footnote-10::) is used for grouping, e.g.:

          $ gcal -Cxw -cg
          -|
          -| Sun, Nov   6th 1994: Text 1
          -| Sun, Nov   6th 1994: Text 2

          -| -grouping text-
          -| Tue, Nov   8th 1994: Text 4
          ...

     The TEXT may contain references to global date and text variables
     (*note Fixed date option `--date-variable=ARGUMENT':
     x-date-variable., and *Note Fixed date option
     `--date-variable=ARGUMENT': x-text-variable).  Furthermore, all
     special texts which cause a text replacement may be used in the
     TEXT (*note `%?'... special texts for text replacement:
     Replacements.).

     Each time a `~' (tilde) or `^' (caret) character is found in TEXT,
     this character is replaced by a real `\n' (newline) character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the `~' (tilde) character
     --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a `\'
     (backslash) character before it, e.g. `\~'.  If you need the `\~'
     characters themselves, you have to protect the `\' (backslash)
     character by another `\' (backslash) character, e.g. `\\_'.  All
     above mentioned facts are also valid for the `^' (caret) character.

     Each time a `_' (underscore) character is found in TEXT, this
     character is replaced by a real ` ' (space) character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the `_' (underscore)
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     `\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. `\_'.  If you need the
     `\_' characters themselves, you have to protect the `\'
     (backslash) character by another `\' (backslash) character, e.g.
     `\\_'.

`k'
`--include-week-number'
     The leading date of a fixed date message is either extended by the
     ISO week number or the standard week number.  *Note Calendar
     option `--starting-day=ARGUMENT': x-starting-day, *Note Calendar
     option `--iso-week-number=yes|no': x-iso-week-number, and *Note
     Aspects in Internationalization: Internationalization, for further
     details.

`o'
`--omit-multiple-date-part'
     Omit displaying the leading date of a fixed date message in case
     more than one message refers to that date(11) (*note Fixed date
     options-Footnote-11::), e.g.:

          $ gcal -cxo
          -|
          -| Sun, Nov   6th 1994: Text 1
          -|                      Text 2
          ...

`Q'
`--suppress-fixed-dates-list-separator'
     Suppress displaying of the blank line which is always leading a
     fixed date list.  For example, to cause Gcal to print only the
     number of days between 1st January 1970 and 1st January 1980, you
     can call the program like this:

          $ gcal -f /dev/null -QUx %19800101 -#0_%j-2440588
          -| 3652

`U'
`--suppress-date-part'
     Suppress displaying the leading date of a fixed date message, e.g.:

          $ gcal -cxU
          -|
          -| Text 1
          -| Text 2
          ...

`J'
`--suppress-text-part'
     Suppress displaying the text part of a fixed date message, e.g.:

          $ gcal -cxJ
          -|
          -| Sun, Nov   6th 1994:
          -| Sun, Nov   6th 1994:
          ...

`x'
`--exclude-fixed-dates-list-title'
     Suppress the title text line of the fixed date list.

`--heading-text=TEXT'
     Changes the title text line of the fixed date list.  Instead of
     displaying the default `Fixed date list:' text, any other text can
     be used as heading text of the fixed date list, e.g.:

          $ gcal -cUJ --heading-text=Hello,_it_is_%K_,~%t__o'clock
          -|
          -| Hello, it is Sunday,
          -| 14:32 o'clock
          -|
          -| Sun, Nov   6th 1994:
          ...

     The TEXT may contain references to global date and text variables
     (*note Fixed date option `--date-variable=ARGUMENT':
     x-date-variable., and *Note Fixed date option
     `--date-variable=ARGUMENT': x-text-variable).  Furthermore, all
     special texts which cause a text replacement may be used in the

     (backslash) character by another `\' (backslash) character, e.g.
     `\\_'.

`z'
`--include-consecutive-number'
     Display consecutive numbers of fixed date messages.

`Z'
`--zero-dates-only'
     Display only those dates, for which fixed dates do not exist, i.e.
     all "empty" fixed dates only consisting of the date.

*Fixed date period modifiers and options:*

`--leap-day=february|march'
     The "leap day"(12) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-12::) is
     observed in non-leap years.

    `--leap-day=february'
          A fixed date that appears in every year and which is related
          to the leap day, is displayed on the 28th February in
          non-leap years.

    `--leap-day=march'
          A fixed date that appears in every year and which is related
          to the leap day, is displayed on the 1st March in non-leap
          years.

`d'
`--include-today'
     If lists of periods are generated, include the actual date into
     the list.  *Note Fixed date option `--list-mode': x-list-mode, how
     to create a list of periods.

`l'
`--list-mode'
     Generate a list of periods instead of a single period.

     *Please note:*
     The following examples assumes the actual system date is the *17th
     February of any year* (00000217), weeks start on Mondays and ISO
     week numbers are used!

`--period-of-fixed-dates=ARGUMENT'

`Nd'
`*dN'
