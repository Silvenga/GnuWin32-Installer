   The `hp2xx' program is a versatile tool to convert vector-oriented
graphics data given in Hewlett-Packard's HP-GL plotter language into a
variety of popular both vector- and raster-oriented graphics formats.

   The various supported output formats include Encapsulated PostScript
(EPS), PCX, IMG, and several formats intended to facilitate the
generation of graphics within TeX documents.  In addition, `hp2xx'
output is printable on the HP Laserjet/Deskjet printer series and some
Epson Stylus printers, and it may be used as a HP-GL previewer on many
platforms, e.g. X11, OS/2, MS Windows and plain old DOS (VGA).

   `hp2xx' first converts all HP-GL data into pure vectors and buffers
them internally. It then converts these vectors into a specified output
format (vector modes), or rasterizes them (raster modes) on an internal
bitmap. In raster modes, `hp2xx' then translates the bitmap into the
output format.

Invoking `hp2xx'
================

The format of the `hp2xx' command is:

     hp2xx [OPTIONS] [INPUT-FILE/S]

   It follows the UNIX System V tradition of a filter, i. e., options
begin with `-', followed by a single letter and an optional parameter.
Options must appear immediately behind the program name and before the
input file name(s) (if specified). If no input file is given, `hp2xx'
reads from `stdin'. In addition to this traditional option handling,
`hp2xx' also supports GNU-style long options and option/non-option
permutation (*note Appendix B::). However, throughout this manual all
examples will only display short options.

   `hp2xx' writes to the output file whose name can be specified by
option `-f'. Without option `-f', `hp2xx' generates output file names
from the input names and the selected mode (see option `-m'). `hp2xx'
writes to `stdout' if you supply a dash as output file name like in
`-f-'.

`hp2xx' for the impatient
=========================

This section is intended to give those of you a quick-start who are
quite familiar with traditional UNIX-style programs and with HP-GL and
other graphics formats.  The following examples will give you a good
idea of `hp2xx''s functionality. *Note Appendix B::, the Option
Summary, for further details.

     hp2xx foo.hp

   Preview of HP-GL graphics in file `foo.hp'. The picture will fit
into a square of 200 mm width, assuming that your output device
(screen) features 75 DPI resolution (default).

     hp2xx -q -d86 -h160 -w220  foo.hp bar.hp

   Multiple-file preview. Option `-q' puts `hp2xx' into "quiet" mode.
The picture will fit into a rectangle of 220 mm width and 160 mm height,
assuming a 86 DPI resolution of the output device (screen).

     hp2xx -t -c12340567 -p12230412 foo.hp

   Preview, size according to original HP-GL data (as on a plotter),
with different pen colors and sizes. Color and width according to:
       `Pen # : Color code     / Size (pixel)'
       `-------------------------------------'
       `  1   : 1 (black)      /    1'
       `  2   : 2 (red)        /    2'
       `  3   : 3 (green)      /    2'
       `  4   : 4 (blue)       /    3'
       `  5   : 0 (background) /    0'
       `  6   : 5 (cyan)       /    4'
       `  7   : 6 (magenta)    /    1'
       `  8   : 7 (yellow)     /    2'

     hp2xx -m eps -l a.log -h100 -w150 -p542  foo.hp bar.hp
   Encapsulated Postscript mode. Files `foo.eps' and `bar.eps' will be
created. The diagnostic output will be written into `a.log', so `hp2xx'
works quietly. Both EPS pictures will fit into a rectangle of size 150
x 200 mm. The size (width) of pen 1: 0.5 mm, pen 2: 0.4 mm, pen 3: 0.2
mm, pen 4 ... pen 8: 0.1 mm.

     unix% cat foo.hp | hp2xx -m pcl -o30 -O50 -i -F -f- | lpr -P ljet

   In this generic UNIX example, `hp2xx' reads HP-GL code from `stdin',
converts it to HP-PCL which is suitable for direct output on any HP
Laserjet printer, and pipes the output via `stdout' into the
appropriate printer queue.  Option `-f-' forces `hp2xx' to write to
`stdout' instead of a file, `-i' initializes the printer before the
output, `-F' sends a FormFeed at the end of output. There will be
(additional) 30 mm left and 50 mm top margins. 75 DPI are assumed per
default.

     hp2xx -m pcx -f foo3.pcx -d300 -h80 -w150 -r90 -P2:4  foo.hp
   PCX mode. Output goes into file `foo3.pcx'. A limiting rectangle of
150 x 80 mm at 300 DPI is assumed. The picture will be rotated by 90
degrees. Only pages 2 to 4 of the multi-page HP-GL source is used (each
occurrence of HP-GL code `PG;' increments the internal page counter).

   This chapter provides you with almost anything you'll need for
successful `hp2xx' applications. You'll probably soon operate `hp2xx'
by solely consulting the option summary (*note Appendix B::) or just by
calling `hp2xx' without any parameters to obtain its built-in option
summary.

Modes of `hp2xx'
================

The mode switch `-m `string'' tells `hp2xx' about the mode it should
use to generate output, i.e., the desired output format. `hp2xx' can
run in three different groups of modes: Generating vector graphics,
raster graphics, or "preview mode", i.e., displaying the graphics.
Preview is the default; *note Appendix B:: for a list of all modes.


File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Sizing your output,  Next: Pen sizes and colors,  Prev: Modes of hp2xx,  Up: Basics

Sizing your output
==================

NOTE: The basic unit length within `hp2xx' is `mm' (millimeter).  This
unit is always assumed except where noted otherwise.

   In contrast to a real HP-GL plotter, `hp2xx' lets you decide freely
about the size of the picture. While preserving the picture's aspect
ratio, `hp2xx' will fit the picture into a window of width W and height
H. By default, W = H = 200 (mm). Set these basic sizes using options
`-w W' and `-h H'.

   Sometimes you'll want to change the aspect factor of a picture,
e.g., to spread out a square picture into landscape. Option `-a AF' is
used for this. AF > 1 increases x/y ratio, 0 < AF < 1 decreases x/y.

   Example: Let's assume your picture covers a native coordinate range
of 100...900 plotter units in x direction and 200...600 in y direction.
Thus, its width is double its height.  Using defaults, `hp2xx' will
create a picture of size 200 x 100 mm, while options `-w 100 -h 40'
will lead to a picture of size 80 x 40 mm, and `-w 100 -h 40 -a 0.5'
results in a 40 x 40 mm picture.

   Alternatively, ignore explicit size control and rely on the true
HP-GL coordinates (and therefore: sizes) of the given input file(s).
Flag `-t' inhibits `-a -h -w' and lets `hp2xx' use true HP-GL sizes,
based on the assumption that 1 HP unit = 1/40 mm.

   Some modes of `hp2xx' support page offsets, i.e., left and upper
margins added to the picture, probably in addition to some hard margins
which cannot be avoided. Currently, these modes are EPS, PCL, and PRE.
The left margin (offset) is modified with option `-o OFF_LEFT', while
the upper margin can be controlled via `-O OFF_UPPER'. OFF_LEFT and
OFF_UPPER are specified in mm.

   Option `-C' (center the picture) works in combination with options
`-o -O' by modifying the offsets in such a way that the resulting
picture is centered within the frame defined by options `-w -h'.
Example: Assume that the picture is a square, and `-w 100 -h 40' are
specified. A 40 mm square with an additional left margin of (100-40)/2
= 30 mm will be produced if option `-C' is given.  If the actual
width/height ration of the picture exactly matches the ratio defined by
`-w -h', option `-C' has no effect.


File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Pen sizes and colors,  Next: Selecting a page (range),  Prev: Sizing your output,  Up: Basics

Pen sizes and colors
====================

Imagine a plotter with a pen carousel, e.g., like the model HP7550A.
The carousel carries a (small) number of pens. Their colors and tip
thicknesses (sizes) are selected by a human operator, while the plotter
only receives commands like "Now use pen number 5". If you don't
provide a pen, the plotter will move and "draw" without this pen if its
number is selected.

   `hp2xx' emulates a carousel of up to 8 pens of various colors and
sizes.  By default, all pens are present, have FOREGROUND color
(typically BLACK), and their tip thicknesses are one unit (1/10 `mm').
(NOTE: in versions before 3.4.2, pen widths in raster modes were
counted in pixels, so the default in those versions was 1/10 `mm' for
vector modes, 1 pixel for raster modes).

   HPGL/2 commands NP,PC,PW may override this for up to 255 freely
configurable pens.

   Pen colors and sizes are represented by digits to allow for a compact
option list. There are 8 colors including BACKGROUND (usually white).
*Note Appendix B::, the Option Summary, for a list of all colors. E.g.,
color 3 is green, and color 7 means yellow. Permitted pen sizes are 0
... 9 units in versions before 3.4.3, or up to 3.5mm (using characters
A to Z to denote the range from 1.0 to 3.5) in later versions.
WARNING: In versions of `hp2xx' before 3.4.3, all raster mode pen sizes
were approximated by double, triple, etc. width, and lines wider than 4
would normally not give useful results. In 3.4.3, the line drawing
algorithm has been substantially improved and should render accurately
scaled pen widths.

   Options `-c C-STRING' and `-s S-STRING' tell `hp2xx' about the pens
to be placed in the carousel.  C-STRING and S-STRING are strings of 1
to 8 digits, corresponding to special choices of pen 1 to 8.  Defaults
are C-STRING = S-STRING = `11111111' unless the hpgl file contains
corresponding PC and/or PW commands. Specifying `-c' or `-s' overrides
the equivalent HPGL/2 command.  If you specify less than 8 pens, the
remaining pens keep their defaults.

   Examples:
     hp2xx -p13 foo.hp
   Show a preview of `foo.hp', drawing all lines with pen #2 three
pixels wide instead of default 1 pixel, which applies to all other pens.

     hp2xx -c12740 -p12230412 foo.hp
   Here, pen #5 is "removed". Pens #1 and #7 keep their default sizes,
all others are set to various sizes.  Pen #2 is red, #3 is yellow, and
#4 is blue, while all other pens keep `foreground' color, e.g., black.

   If your HP-GL file contains the PC and/or PW commands introduced with
HP-GL/2, these are interpreted to allow up to 255 pens. The special case
where a pen is redefined to take on different colors is currently only
supported in PostScript or PDF output mode. In all other modes, the
last PC command encountered determines that pens' color for the entire
plot.


File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Selecting a page (range),  Next: Vector formats,  Prev: Pen sizes and colors,  Up: Basics

Selecting a page
================

There is a HP-GL command named `PG;' which amounts to a FormFeed.
Thus, there are multi-page HP-GL sources. While `hp2xx' was designed
for just one output picture per input file, there is a simple way to
cope also with multi-page sources:

   `hp2xx' keeps track of the number of encountered `PG;' commands.
All code up to the next (if any) `PG;' command is considered a single
page. Pages are counted, starting at 1. You can ask `hp2xx' to ignore
all HP-GL commands other than on page N with option `-P N', effectively
filtering out any one-page graphics.  Sometimes, converting a whole
page range makes sense, too. Therefore, `hp2xx' also accepts page
ranges via `-P N1:N2'.  The default is `-P 0' which selects all pages.
The output will be split into appropriate files whose name is derived
from the base name of the input file by appending the frame number
before the filetype extension. In preview mode, each page will display
as a separate image - in contrast to versions earlier than 3.4.3, which
would render everything in one image.

   WARNING: Some HP-GL sources may start with a `PG;' so the first page
of your graphics may be 2 instead of 1. Look for the number of
encountered pages in the diagnostic output if you miss the expected
page!  If the detected coordinate range shows unreasonable numbers like
1e10, you'll be probably looking at an empty page.


File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Vector formats,  Next: Raster formats,  Prev: Selecting a page (range),  Up: Basics

Vector formats
==============

All HP-GL graphics are decomposed by `hp2xx' into elementary move and
draw commands. Selecting a vector mode essentially defines the
conversion rules of such commands into specific formats.

   The most popular and versatile vector format currently is
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS). (In fact, it is much more than just a
vector graphics format, but `hp2xx' uses only EPS's line drawing
features.) Many programs allow importation of EPS files, and PostScript
gives excellent printing results, so `-m `eps'' is highly recommended.
Recently, Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) has mostly taken its
place for formatted online documentation. For Web-based applications,
the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format, a W3C standard, holds some
promise as a non-proprietary, XML-based format for vector images, not
only on web pages.  In the engineering community, the 2D DXF format
originally used by AutoCAD has become a common denominator for the
exchange of vector data. In the machine-tooling community, a
standardized vector format knows as G code is widely used (though
machine-specific limitations and extensions make it not truely
universal). Its implementation in `hp2xx', selectable via the `-m `nc''
option, should be suitable for hobbyists wishing to do engraving, but
it would not be wise to use it in professional machine tooling.

   Unix users may also want to use either `Gnuplot' or especially `XFig'
to annotate their plots. The native formats of these programs are
directly supported via the `-m `gpt'' and `-m `fig'' options.

   The Enhanced Metafile Format was originally tied to the Microsoft
Windows environment, but it has recently found more wide-spread use as
one of the few vector formats supported by StarOffice and OpenOffice.

   Currently, all other supported vector formats represent various
compromises to persuade TeX or LaTeX into the generation of graphics.
*Note TeX formats::, if you are specially interested in TeX.


File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Raster formats,  Next: Printer formats,  Prev: Vector formats,  Up: Basics

Raster formats
==============

Raster graphics are probably the most widely used graphics by now.
Many publishing programs accept rasterized graphics. It's likely you'll
use `hp2xx' primarily in some raster mode.

   In addition to vector modes, all raster modes need the desired
resolution of an assumed underlying pixel grid to plot on, i. e., the
number of pixels per unit length within that grid.  A traditional
measure is the number of "dots per inch" (DPI).  `hp2xx' makes an
exception from its usual unit length `mm' and lets you specify the
traditional DPI values.  Option `-d NUM' affects both x and y
direction, NUM being the DPI value (an integer). if `-D NUM_Y' is also
specified, NUM_Y will override the NUM DPI value, but only for the y
direction.

   Some programs were found, which generate HPGL output with too tight
clipping bounds, which lead, for example, to some parts of text
characters clipped off.  Use option `-e NUM' to add some extra amount
of space to clip areas to work around such problems. For example, `-e
40' will add 40 extra plotter units to every side of the clipping box,
which corresponds to `1 mm' in true size.

   There are plenty of raster formats on various platforms, much more
than `hp2xx' will ever handle. The supported raster formats IMG, JPG,
PBM/PPM, PCL, PCX, PNG and TIFF were chosen for their widespread use,
their simplicity, for actual demand, and for accessibility of
specifications.  If your desired format is not supported, look for a
converter. E.g., the Portable Bitmap (PBM) project and more recently,
the ImageMagick package offer quite a variety of such converters.

   Please note that the preview mode (which does not create any output
file) is a special raster mode. Instead of going into some output file,
the internal bitmap is transferred into display memory.  Therefore, the
above considerations apply also to preview mode.


File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Printer formats,  Next: Preview,  Prev: Raster formats,  Up: Basics

Printer formats
===============

Currently, there is only one well-tested printer format (not counting
`eps', which is printable on PostScript printers): `pcl', which stands
for HP PCL Level 3. Essentially it is a raster format, but it comes
with a few restrictions and additional options which correspond to
printer properties.  It prints on HP Laserjet and HP Deskjet series
printers and compatibles.

   The restriction concerns the resolution (DPI) during rasterization.
Due to printer hardware limitations, only `-d 75', `-d 100', `-d 150',
and `-d 300' are recommended (`hp2xx' will emit a warning for other
values, but will try to create the desired output); option `-D' must not
be used. Some recent printer models do support 600, 720 or even higher
resolutions, but even for those the requirements both in terms of cpu
load and file size may be prohibitive at least on older systems.

   There are two flags which may be useful if the output goes directly
to a printer: Option `-i' initializes the printer and tries to select
the required paper format before the output starts, and `-F' sends a
FormFeed (ASCII 12) after the output.

   For the HP Deskjet printer series, there is support of some "special"
commands; `-S 1' activates these. There is a limited support of color
modes available, too: For the DJ500C and newer models, `hp2xx' can
generate both CMY-based and CMYK-based color output (if colors are used:
see option `-c'). Supply option `-S 3' for CMY color mode, and option
`-S 4' for CMYK color mode (for the DJ550C). The Deskjet modes
automatically invoke TIFF compression (mode 2), while pure PCL Level 3
does not know about compression. NOTE: Some recent low-end Designjet
plotters (if ordered without the HPGL processor board) and probably also
some models of Deskjet use a sparsely documented variant called PCL3GUI
which appears to differ at least in the initialization sequence used.
Currently `hp2xx' will not work well - maybe even not at all - with
such printers.

   A driver for the Esc/P2 raster language used by the Epson Stylus
series of inkjet printers has been added in `hp2xx-3.4.0'. This should
work at least for the small-format printers at 720 dpi.


File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Preview,  Next: Misc. options,  Prev: Printer formats,  Up: Basics

Preview
=======

Preview mode is `hp2xx''s default. Its use prior to all other
conversions is recommended since it offers a good impression of your
final results. Functionally it is also a raster mode.

   Depending on your hardware and operating system platform, `hp2xx'
uses one of a variety of preview modules.  On GUIs, a window containing
the graphics will pop up, while on other systems the whole screen may
be used for preview. You can control the position of a preview window
via options `-o' and `-O' in a natural way. In full-screen previews,
unused spaces are padded to the right and bottom with background color.

   Since there is no way for `hp2xx' to predict the actual size and
resolution of your preview device, e.g., screen, you may have to gauge
`hp2xx''s preview mode (using options `-whdD'). For example, if your
device effectively works at 86 DPI and offers an active area of 24 by
18 cm,
     hp2xx -d86 -w240 -h180 foo.hp
   will make maximum use of your screen area and give you correct sizes.
Since a single gauge will do for all future calls, you'll probably want
to create some one-line batch file for invoking `hp2xx' in preview
mode, correctly gauged for your screen.

   Depending on page offsets and the selected sizes and resolutions, a
preview may not fit on your screen. In that case, some preview modules
simply clip the picture; others give a warning but let you continue
(DOS), and others simply terminate.

   The X11 viewer allows to pan the visible area using mouse button one
(which usually corresponds to the left button), and supports one level
of zoom around the current cursor position, selectable with button two
(middle button, or right button on two-button mice).

   DOS users: Most VGA cards offer high-resolution modes (SVGAs).
Unfortunately, there is no software standard for these modes. `hp2xx'
lets you utilize these modes anyway with just a little help from you.
Tell `hp2xx' the so-called mode byte of your favorite hi-res mode via
option `-V NUM'. Since `hp2xx' issues only standard BIOS calls for mode
switching, setting of color look-up table entries, and pixel drawing,
chances are good that your VGA card's hi-res modes will work!

   WARNING: You can damage your hardware by specifying inappropriate
VGA modes!  Generally you'll need a monitor which can sync on the
horizontal frequency of the selected VGA hi-res mode, e.g., a
multi-scan monitor. In case of doubt, switch off your monitor
immediately!!


File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Misc. options,  Prev: Preview,  Up: Basics

Misc. options
=============

`hp2xx' features an on-line options summary. Invoking `hp2xx' with
option `-H', or with any illegal option or without any parameter, will
display about 2 pages of text. (Note: I'd have preferred option `-h'
for on-line help, but this option is needed by the indispensable HEIGHT
parameter.)

   The list of supported output files (displayed for the `-m' parameter)
shown in the help text always corresponds to the selection actually
compiled into that particular executable copy of `hp2xx' (which may
vary according to licensing considerations, local availability of
third-party libraries, or preferences of whoever built it).

   During operation, `hp2xx' outputs various information about the
current HP-GL file and about `hp2xx''s actions. As usual, all this goes
to `stderr'. You can re-direct these diagnostics into a file even
without any help from a UNIX shell by specifying a log file using option
`-l LOGFILE', or you may switch off diagnostics completely with option
`-q' (`quiet' mode). NOTE: Using both options as in `-q -l LOGFILE' is
of no use as it will result in an empty LOGFILE.

   Finally, there is a simple way to rotate whole pictures: Option `-r
ANGLE' rotates the picture counter-clockwise by the supplied angle
(given in degrees). E.g.,
     hp2xx -r90 foo.hp
   will show the picture rotated by 90 degrees, letting vectors
originally pointing left-to-right now point botttom-to-top. This may be
handy e.g. for printing in landscape format.  NOTE: The limiting
rectangle supplied by `-hw' is not affected by `-r', so in order to
obtain e.g. a full-page landscape picture on an A4 page, issue a
command similar to:
     hp2xx -m pcl -d 150 -r90 -h270 -w160 landscape.hp

The coordinate range
====================

The natural unit of length in HP-GL is 1/40 mm = 0.025 mm, so a typical
A4 page covers roughly 11000 x 7500 natural units. Typically,
coordinates in HP-GL commands will be found in the range 0 ... 12000.
`hp2xx' will tell you the maximum and minimum coordinates ("picture
limits") it finds in your HP-GL picture for both x and y direction.
These values usually roughly cover this range.  Even if your HP-GL
source plots in user-specific coordinates (realized via HP-GL command
`SC;' (SCale) ), this remains true, since `hp2xx' internally transforms
all points back to natural coordinates.  Whenever the above range is
grossly violated, you may suspect corrupted data, because no real
plotter would be able to plot such a file.

   If you ever discover a picture limit equalling plus or minus 10^10,
your HP-GL probably didn't draw anything. Initially, `hp2xx''s internal
picture limits are set to impossibly large (or small) values, i. e., +-
10^10, but the first plot command will set them to values found
therein, and successive plots push the limits outward. Example: XMAX
starts at -10^10, the first plot command may change it to 2536, the
next to 3470, the next 20 command fall short, etc. Eventually, XMAX
assumes the largest value and stays there. Knowledge about these
details may sometimes be crucial (*note Scaling to true size::).

   `hp2xx' uses the picture limits internally for scaling and fitting
the data into the supplied  limiting rectangle (*note Sizing your
output::).  You can also affect the picture limits yourself for special
effects (*note Fixed scaling::).

Fixed scaling
=============

As noted earlier, `hp2xx' does not draw to scale, but rather it fits a
picture into a given limiting window. While this is very handy in most
applications, it may be undesirable when a series of pictures must be
drawn to the same scale. Unless all pictures possess the same picture
limits (modulo offsets), e.g., because all of them are surrounded by
some fixed frame, `hp2xx' would scale them all up differently to fit
each of them tightly into the limiting window.

   There are two simple cures: First, make use of the true size option
`-t'.  If the original HP-GL sizes do not fit, adjust picture limits to
guarantee a constant scaling: Make a preview of all pictures and note
the coordinate ranges `hp2xx' reports. Then, determine picture limits
which cover all of these individual limits. Finally, run `hp2xx' to
create your desired outputs using options `-xXyY' to tell `hp2xx' about
the picture limits it should use. If the pictures do not share common
offsets, you may have to correct for offsets manually. Use the preview
mode for testing. You'll get the same scale as long as the limiting
window and (XMAX - XMIN) and (YMAX - YMIN) remain constant for all
pictures.

   WARNING: `hp2xx' does not clip lines (unless told to by the IW
directive of HPGL/2, of course). If the picture limits which you
manually can pre-set via options `-xXyY' are chosen too narrow, they
will be pushed outside just as described in the last section, resulting
in a different scale. Check the coordinate ranges `hp2xx' reports. The
should match the values supplied by options `-xXyY'!

Scaling to true size
====================

The very first (i.e. ancient) releases of `hp2xx' (binaries) did not
offer option `-t', which does everything you'll need for producing
output with exactly the sizes shown on a real plotter. The following
paragraph shows how to manually emulate the working of this option.
Though outdated, I left it in the manual as background material:

   Sometimes you might want to create pictures sized exactly as if they
were drawn on a real plotter. There is a little trick which allows you
to do so using `hp2xx': As notes above, the natural unit of length in
HP-GL is 0.025 mm. Therefore, you can calculate the true picture size
from the picture limits reported by `hp2xx'. Transform these data into
mm and simply specify the limiting window accordingly!  Example: `hp2xx
truesize.hp' reports the following coordinate ranges: XMIN = 250, XMAX
= 5250, YMIN = 100, YMAX = 3100.  Thus, the picture is (XMAX - XMIN) *
0.025 mm = 125 mm wide and YMAX - YMIN) * 0.025 mm = 75 mm high, and
`hp2xx -w125 -h75 truesize.hp' will draw it in true size.

Swapping
========

`hp2xx' allocates memory for an internal bitmap dynamically.  Large
pictures, high resolution, and use of colors may combine to let your
computer run out of memory (especially on non-swapping operating
systems like DOS).

   In this case, `hp2xx' swaps the bitmap to disk, slowing down
considerably. Redirecting swapping to a fast disk, preferably a RAM
disk, might speed up things. You can replace the default swap file
`hp2xx.swp' using `-s `swapfile''.  NOTE: If for some reason `hp2xx' is
aborted during swapping, you might have to delete the swap file
manually.


File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Dots and lines,  Next: Unsupported formats,  Prev: Swapping,  Up: Advanced subjects

Dots and lines
==============

Here are some basics about the generation of dots and lines within
`hp2xx'. I mention them, because there is something left to be improved
here...

   Some HP-GL codes cause `hp2xx' to generate points rather than lines
of length zero. There is a subtle difference between both. Depending on
the current output format, special code for points will be generated,
and occasionally, a point will look different from a zero-length line.
Use `-m epic' for such an example.

   Line thicknesses can vary. Especially for thick lines, the matter of
line caps (how lines are ended, e.g. with a round cap) becomes relevant.
(According to the HPGL/2 references, these issues are only relevant for
lines wider than 3.5 mm).  `hp2xx' does not yet offer complete support
for these features - currently your best bet is to use `-m eps' or `-m
pdf', as `hp2xx' will simply emit the corresponding linestyle commands
of those formats instead of having to calculate all the details itself.
While most line end cap types are supported even in the raster modes
(since version 3.4.3), this applies especially to the mitering options,
i.e. the way the junction is drawn.  To force a certain type of line
caps, you can also use `-m eps', edit the resulting Encapsulated
PostScript file, look for a line with `setlinecap' in it (near line
45), and select the line cap of your choice by modifying the PostScript
command `setlinecap' accordingly. You can also use Metafont (via `-m
mf') and replace the picked pen "pencircle" by some other type.
However, both methods are far from convenient.

   The internal rasterization done by versions of `hp2xx' before 3.4.3
was a simple process based on positioning squares (roughly corresponding
to the linewidth) by the Bresenham algorithm. Since 3.4.3, a modified
algorithm for drawing wide lines - based on an IBM Technical Bulletin
written by Alan Murphy - is employed, which also supports true endcap
drawing. The current code still does not support the various miter
options, e.g. drawing out the endpoints of two lines so that they meet
in an exact triangle or a blunt wedge. Unfortunately the current layout
makes it hard to implement such a feature, as the internal
representation of the command sequence is just another sequential list
of lines without any indication of intersections.

Unsupported formats
===================

This is just a brief note, not a real manual entry - sorry.
`PIC'
     	ATARI format, e.g. for the text processor Signum. Try to replace
     by IMG.

`PAC'
     	ATARI format, e.g. for the CAD program STAD

`DJ_GR'
     	DOS previewer, based on DJ Delorie's gcc port and extender go32.
     Works fine, but will be replaced by DOS/OS2 EMX version.
     Abandoned by new maintainer due to lack of platform - volunteers
     welcome.

`OS2'
     	Full-screen OS/2 2.x and DOS previewer. HWW: I don't yet have the
     right development system, so this code is still missing.
     MK: Any volunteers ? Is this still needed at all, now that several
     years have passed since HWW wrote this comment ? OS/2 users should
     be able to use the `PM' mode, which is kept alive by Kazutaka
     Nishiyama.



File: hp2xx.info,  Node: TeX formats,  Prev: Unsupported formats,  Up: Advanced subjects

TeX  formats
============

This section is a bit historic now, as one can easily embed `eps'
graphics in LaTeX and preview the result with xdvi et al. nowadays.  I
have left it in for the sake of completeness, and for special cases
where one might still prefer plain TeX or one of the classical import
methods.

   TeX  was designed for typesetting, not for handling graphics. Putting
graphics directly into TeX  therefore is always somewhat clumsy.
`hp2xx' offers four different compromises to do that, and much better,
though more indirect ways.

   `-m `mf'' generates Metafont source code. Run `Metafont' and
`gftopk', and you'll end up with a special `pk' font containing the
single letter Z which represents your picture. Placing this Z somewhere
in your document using standard TeX  commands draws your picture there.

   If you want to avoid fiddling with additional programs and fonts, if
you work with LaTeX, and if you do not need high-quality plots, the
macros within `epic.sty' may help you.  `-m `tex'' causes `hp2xx' to
generate appropriate TeX source code which you can `\input{}' into
LaTeX sources.

   For emTeX users, there are yet another two way: `-m `em'' creates
TeX code containing many commands like `\special{em:...}' for line
drawing. The line drawing task will therefore be handled not by TeX
itself but by the emTeX drivers which can handle arbitrary line slopes
etc. Similarly, `-m `cad'' produces code based on the same principle,
but compatible with program `TeXcad.exe', which is distributed as a
part of emTeX, and which offers editing and drawing features for the
desired HP-GL figure(s).

   Please note that all methods for generation of graphics WITHIN TeX
are compromises which usually work only for simple graphics.  You'll
probably prefer using external methods like including EPS vector
graphics files with Tom Rokicki's `dvips' driver, or PCX files via the
emTeX drivers, or you'll generate special fonts with convenient
programs like F. Sowa's `bm2font'. `hp2xx' can help you in all of these
cases. The following table shows the pros and cons of the various
approaches (all are based on PD software):

     Internal methods (all allowing DVI previewing of graphs):
     
     via Metafont
       `+:' Machine-independent; fully compatible with TeX
       `-:' Slow; capacity problems with Metafont / gftopk / some DVI drivers
                 if used with large and/or complex graphics
     
     via `epic.sty'
       `+:' Machine-independent; single-step, native LaTeX approach; PD software
       `-:' Slow; requires LaTeX; low-quality lines; just one line thickness;
                 complex graphs may exceed TeX capacity
     
     via emTeX's `\special{em:...}'
       `+:' No TeX capacity problem; good line quality; single-step procedure;
                 rasterization on demand, giving optimal resolution
       `-:' Slows down drivers; driver capacity may be exceeded; emTeX required
     
     
     External methods:
     
     via PCX file inclusion:
       `+:' Easy and fast; DVI preview of graphics
       `-:' Requires emTeX drivers (only available on DOS and OS/2)
     
     via special fonts:
       `+:' Easy, fast, and trouble-free font generation via `bm2font';
                 DVI preview of graphics (!); portable
       `-:' Many files for fonts etc.; confusing for novices
     
     via EPS:
       `+:' High-quality results; easy; no burden for TeX or drivers
       `-:' No DVI preview (unless ghostscript is available); PostScript
     	    printer (or, e.g., GhostScript) required;
                 PostScript previewing is slower than pure DVI previewing.

* Source-level installation::


File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Installation of run-time versions,  Next: Source-level installation,  Up: Installation procedure

Installing an executable version
--------------------------------

This is simple! If you find a collection of pre-compiled versions of
`hp2xx', obtain the file `read.me' and read it to find out the name of
the file which fits to your system. Obtain it, rename it to something
like `hp2xx' or `hp2xx.exe', and place it somewhere on your search path
- that's it.  Linux users will usually be able to find appropriate
`RPM', `DEB' or similar binary packages for their distribution on the
CDs and websites of the various distributors. FreeBSD users should
check the `ports' collection for packages, and users of commercial
unices should check the freeware archives provided by their vendors.
Finally, users of that other operating system may find semi-current
versions through the gnuwin32 project page on sourceforge.net.

   However, since the source release of `hp2xx' under the GNU public
license, the usual mode of installation has become configuring and
building `hp2xx' on your own system. This is detailed in the next
section.


File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Source-level installation,  Prev: Installation of run-time versions,  Up: Installation procedure

Source-level installation
-------------------------

NOTE: I am tempted to switch to GNU autoconf , i.e. have a configure
script generate the necessary Makefile automagically. This will probably
not be welcomed by those not on Unix-like platforms, however.
Currently, installation depends too much on manual work yet. Here is a
description how to proceed:

   After unbundling all sources, go to subdirectory `./makes'. Select a
makefile most closely resembling your system's needs from the samples
given, copy it to `./sources/makefile', adapt it manually (if
necessary), and run `make all'. (The source package as distributed
through ftp.gnu.org usually contains a file `sources/Makefile'. This is
what i use myself on Linux systems, so you could try using that one
first, if you are trying to build `hp2xx' on this or a similar platform.
If everything is set correctly, this results directly in a valid
executable file which you may install at any convenient place on your
search path.

   There are two types of makefile adaptation: First, let's assume there
is a makefile template available for your system. You then have the
option to add a few non-default modes. (These are typically
platform-specific modes, or modes requiring third-party libraries like
PNG,JPEG,TIFF or PDF that are not usually part of a default system
installation - particularly on commercial operating systems ). Do so by
un-commenting the appropriate lines near the beginning of the makefile,
and by commenting out the corresponding standard lines.

   The second type of course applies to systems with special needs
which are not yet covered by any makefile template. Currently, you are
on your own when it comes to supplying alternate paths, renaming or
adding system libraries and alike. Most probably you might have to tell
the makefile where to look for the X11 stuff, and where to find the png
library, if at all.

   Note: Don't feel alarmed if your makefile seems to neglect many
source files.  Any single installation will make use of only one
previewer (two on SUNs with activated SunView support), and there are
platform-dependent sources for some output formats which are not always
used.

   Users wishing to compile `hp2xx' on MS Windows systems will find a
step-by-step procedure in the file `hp2xx_nt' in the documentation
directory.

Adding your own formats
=======================

First, study *Note Introduction:: for the outline of the modular
structure and general operation of `hp2xx'.

   Let's assume you want to support TIFF format. The probably easiest
way of adding new formats is by modifying copies of existing files.
Since TIFF is a raster format, a good starting point would be
`to_pcx.c'.  (Files `to_mf.c' or `to_eps.c' should be considered in case
of a vector format, and `to_vga.c' or `to_x11.c' in case of a new
previewer.) Copy it to a file `to_tiff.c' and edit the latter.  The old
code is pretty much self-explanatory. Essentially, the output file is
opened, initializations are performed, and the internal bitmap is
converted into the target format (here, TIFF) scanline-by-scanline.
There is just one routine called from other modules (originally named
`PicBuf_to_PCX'. Rename it to e.g. `PicBuf_to_TIFF' ) and adapt the
conversion code.

   Once you've done that, the rest (integration of the new format into
the package) is easy: First, edit `hp2xx.h' and add a prototype line
for `PicBuf_to_TIFF' in analogy to e.g., `PicBuf_to_PCX'.  Edit the
`makefile's and add `to_tiff.c' to the list of sources and e.g.
`to_tiff.o' to the list of objects. Now you are ready for compilation
tests (but not for linking yet).

   Then, change the main file `hp2xx.c' at various places: Near the
beginning of the file, add `XX_TIFF, ' to the `hp2xx_mode' typedef, and
a line like `XX_TIFF,   "tiff", ' to the `ModeList' struct below.
Please note the alphabetical order of these lists. Never put anything
behind the termination code `XX_TERM'! At the end of the file, add a
`case' statement to the `switch' list in analogy to e.g.  the `PCX'
entry.

   You may also want to add a line to the on-line help to announce the
new format, and change the release number and date.  Look for functions
`Send_ID' and `usage_msg' at the first quarter of file `hp2xx.c'!

   Now a `make all' will produce code containing the new format.  If
your format turns out to work nicely and seems to be of general
interest, please consider contributing it to the `hp2xx' project.

File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Font coding,  Prev: Future improvements,  Up: Installation and modification notes

Font coding
===========

This section is intended for those few users who might care to improve
the built-in character set of `hp2xx'.

   HP-GL plotters feature built-in fonts with both fixed and
variable-width characters. There are commands for font selection and
quick switching between two pre-selected fonts, and there is also a way
for users to download own character definitions.

   `hp2xx' currently features just a few fixed-width  character sets.

   If you plan to modify these characters set or to add more, you need
an understanding of how characters are drawn by `hp2xx'. The source
file `charset.h' contains a comment explaining this procedure. Below
you find a (modified) copy of this:

      This file defines a standard character set by elementary
      "draw" & "move" commands. The format is a very compact one from
      the old days where every byte was still appreciated.
     
      A font or character set is an array of strings. Each character is
      addressed by its ASCII code.
     
      A character is a (NULL-terminated) string of bytes. Each byte
      codes for a draw or move action according to the code below:
     
          `Bit: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0'
          `     p x x x y y y y'
     
      `p:   ' Plot flag. If set, "draw to" new point, else "move to" it.
      `xxx: ' 3-bit unsigned integer  (0...7). X coordinate of new point.
      `yyyy:' 4-bit unsigned integer (0..15). Y coordinate of new point.
     
      The baseline is y = 4 instead of y = 0, so characters with parts
      below it can be drawn properly. Function "code_to_ucoord" transforms
      these coordinates into actual user coordinates.
     
      Example:  code for character `'L': "\032\224\324"' translates to:
                `moveto(1,10); drawto(1,4); drawto(5,4);'
     
     
      From the example you can conclude that the font below essentially is
      defined on a 5x7 grid:
     
          `    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7'
          `15  - - - - - - - -     - : unused'
          `14  - - - - - - - -     # : always used'
          `13  - - - - - - - -     o : sometimes used'
          `12  - - - - - - - -'
          `11  - - - - - - - -'
          `10  o # # # # # - -'
          ` 9  o # # # # # - -'
          ` 8  o # # # # # - -'
          ` 7  o # # # # # - -'
          ` 6  o # # # # # - -'
          ` 5  o # # # # # - -'
          ` 4  o # # # # # - -'
          ` 3  o o o o o o - -'
          ` 2  o o o o o o - -'
          ` 1  o o o o o o - -'
          ` 0  o o o o o o - -'

Known HP-GL commands
********************

`hp2xx' originally emulated a subset of the Hewlett-Packard 7550A
plotter.  The following manual was used as reference for command
definitions: `[1] HP 7550A Interfacing and Programming Manual'. This
has gradually been expanded to include almost all of what is now known
as HPGL/1, and most of the commands from HPGL/2.

   Not all commands are supported. Among the non-supported commands are
those which do not really apply to a software emulator, like:

     commands affecting the communication between plotter and host computer,
     commands for changing the behaviour of a real plotter, like plotting speed etc.,
     commands for the control of plotter memory allocation,
     commands causing various plotter display outputs.

   Other non-supported commands would be desirable, but were left out
due to their inherent complexity (or just because nobody had an
immediate need for them yet).

   Programmers intending to add more HP-GL features should ideally take
care to implement the less-than-obvious side effects of existing
commands on the new features, too (and vice versa). E. g., line types
(`LT;') affect most but not all drawing commands: While the `ER;'
command (edge rectangle relative) uses the current line type, its
counterpart `EA;' (edge rectangle absolute) always draws solid lines.
However, both `PR;' and `PA;' use the current line type! In addition,
new features may need initializations by the already supported codes
`IN;' or `DF;', so these may have to be expanded.

   The remainder of this section lists all HP-GL commands given on
pages 1-2 to 1-4 of [1] and marks them as either

           `(.)'  not applicable,
           `(-)'  ignored,
           `(*)'  partly supported, or
           `(+)'  supported.

   The label "supported" is used when I think the command is fully
supported in the context of the already implemented commands. In
general, you should have absolutely no problem with this class of
commands.

   Though there still are unsupported commands, this does not mean that
you might have trouble using `hp2xx'. Nowadays, most HP-GL files are
machine-generated, e.g. by CAD or DTP programs. These tend to make use
of just a subset of HP-GL. To my experience, chances are high that
`hp2xx' will give you the picture you want! (Areas where hp2xx is
definitely lacking are font support and polygon fills, but even there
you should get a good approximation of what a plotter would produce).

* Menu:

* General options::
* Size controls::
* Raster format controls::
* PCL specifics::
* TIFF specifics::
* DXF specifics::
* Margins::
* Preview (DOS only)::
* Help::

   In the following, options are grouped into subjects and are listed
alphabetically within each subject. Both long options and short
(one-letter) options are listed, where short options appear in
parentheses. Except for the +DPI option, there is a one-to-one
correspondence between long and short options. You may use either long
or short options.  Mixing long and short options is acceptable.

   Option parameter names suggest the expected data type, e. g.,
`--rotate (-r) FLOAT' means that option `--rotate' or its corresponding
short form `-r' expect a parameter of type `float'.

General options
===============

`--pencolors (-c) STRING'
     Pen color(s), a string of 1 to 8 digits.  Valid digits: 0...7

     5=Cyan, 6=Magenta, 7=Yellow). Default: `11111111'

`--outfile (-f) STRING'
     Name of output file. If omitted, `hp2xx' generates the name from
     the input file name and the current mode string. `-f-' causes
     `hp2xx' to write to `stdout'. Default: none.

`--logfile (-l) STRING'
     Name of log file. If given, diagnostics go into this file, else to
     `stderr'. Remark: `-q' inhibits all diagnostics!

`--mode (-m) STRING'
     Mode string. Valid: STRING =
            `cad'  (TeXcad-compatible line generation using `\special{em:...}'),

     scales (e.g. thumbnails in an overview listing), or to work around
     problems in the polygon fill code.

`--pensize (-p) STRING'
     Pensize(s), a string of 1 to 8 digits.  Valid digits: 0...9 (unit
     = 1/10 mm) for vector modes, 0...4 (unit = pixel) for raster

     Name of swap file. Default: STRING = `hp2xx.swp'.

`--mapzero (-M) INT'
     Remap commands affecting pen number zero to any other (preferably
     unused) pen (mainly to avoid changing the background color of
     raster format files).

     where it sets the retraction level of the tool.

`--truesize (-t)'
     Ignore options `-a -h -w' (aspect factor, height, width). Size
     information will come from the HP-GL intrinsic data. WARNING:
     Avoid using option `-r' (rotate) as it works on top of HP-GL and
     thus will distort the detected HP-GL sizes.



File: hp2xx.info,  Node: Raster format controls,  Next: PCL specifics,  Prev: Size controls,  Up: Appendix B

Raster format controls
