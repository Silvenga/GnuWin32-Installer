Here is an alphabetical list of most terms with short description that
are introduced and used in this manual:

     Gregorian calendar in AD 1582.

"Julian date"
"Julian day number"
     A day number that is based on the date 1st January 4713 BCE, which
     is the starting day zero of a consecutive day counting used in

     midnight, but at noon Universal time.

"Leap day"

"Leap year"
     In the Gregorian calendar, a leap year is any year which number
     can be divided by 4 without a remainder, and years ending in
     hundreds are no leap years unless they are divisible by 400.  But
     the Eastern Orthodox churches compute leap years within the
     Gregorian calendar by using another rule; and that, a leap year is
     any year which number can be divided by 4 without a remainder, and
     years ending in hundreds are leap years, if a remainder of 2 or 6
     occurs when such a year is divided by 9.

     culmination of the vernal equinox point in the meridian of the

     value (Latin term `magnitudo', abbreviated m).  The difference
     between two consecutive magnitudes is 1 to 2.512.  Therefore, a
     star with the brightness of 1m is 2.512 times brighter than a star
     of 2m.  A negative magnitude denotes a very bright star, for
     example almost -27m for the Sun, whereas the hardly visible planet
     Pluto has a magnitude of a bit more than +14m.  The Full Moon has
     a visual brightness of about -12m.55.

     A star day is also known as a _mean solar day_.  Because the Sun
     apparently shifts with respect to the vernal equinox point on the
     ecliptic due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, the star day and
     the true solar day have a different length.  As the true Sun

"Opposition"
     The Earth is in one line between the celestial body and the Sun,
     and therefore, the celestial body is completely visible from the
     Earth.  In terms of the Moon, this is the Full Moon phase.

     that specify a Portable Operating System interface.  The `IX'
     denotes the Unix heritage of these standards.

"Proleptic calendar mode"

     system in the historic reality during this definite period.

     sending it to the _standard output channel_.

"Refraction"
     Refraction is an optical phenomenon caused by the Earth's

     Observations of celestial bodies that are done from the surface of
     the Earth yield in topocentrically based values.

"True solar time"
"True solar day"
     A true solar day is the period between two consecutive lower
     culminations of the Sun.  This entity is taken as the base for
     deriving the true solar time (as it is also shown by a sundial
     during the day).

"True track"
"Course angle"
     The course angle gives the direction, which is the vertex of a
     great circles arc (Orthodrome) that is casted between two points
     on a surface of a sphere, at a meridian (Gcal uses a geoid
     (rotation ellipsoid) that is calculated taking pattern from the
     `World Geodetic System', short W.G.S, that was designed in 1961).
     Such an arc is the shortest geodetic connecting line between two
     points on a sphere.  Indeed, the course angles on such an arc are
     changing continually, because the circular line that is casted
     intersects each meridian with another angle -- except the case,
     that both co-ordinates are referring to exactly the same longitude
     or to exactly the same latitude.

"Twilight"
     The interval of time before sunrise and again after sunset, during
     which natural light is provided by the upper atmosphere that does
     receive direct sunlight and reflects parts of it towards the
     Earth's surface.

"Unix"
     A computer operating system originally developed in the early
     1970's at AT&T Bell Laboratories.  It initially became popular in
     universities around the world, and later moved into commercial
     environments as a software development system and network server
     system. There are many commercial versions of Unix, as well as
     several work-alike systems whose source code is freely available
     (such as Linux, NetBSD, and FreeBSD).

"Vernal equinox point on the ecliptic"
     The point where the ascending Sun's orbit intersects the celestial
     equator.

"Whitespace character"
     For example _Tab_, _Space_, _Form-feed_ and similar characters.

"Winter point on the ecliptic"
"Winter solstice"
"Solstice in winter"
     The Sun's orbit crosses the lowest point below the celestial
     equator that is passed during a revolution of the Earth around the
     Sun.

"Word"
     A sequence of one or more letters, digits, or underscores (`_') in
     a regular expression.

"Zuhr prayer time"
     The second Islamic prayer time.  Begins after the astronomical
     noon time of the Sun, and ends at the beginning of the _Asr_
     prayer time.
