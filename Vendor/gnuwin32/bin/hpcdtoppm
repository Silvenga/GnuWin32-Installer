You are running a program named 'hpcdtoppm' that stands in for the
real program by that name.

The real 'hpcdtoppm' is a program that converts an image from Photo CD
format to PPM format.  The program you are running now just issues the
message you are reading.

Please get a copy of Hpcdtoppm from 

  ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/graphics/convert

and replace this stand-in program with the real one.

The point of this is that this stand-in 'hpcdtoppm' is distributed
with Netpbm on Sourceforge.  Hpcdtoppm does not meet the requirements
to be distributed on Sourceforge because a copyright holder does not
permit people to sell copies.  In the past the real Hpcdtoppm was
distributed with Netpbm on Sourceforge by mistake.
