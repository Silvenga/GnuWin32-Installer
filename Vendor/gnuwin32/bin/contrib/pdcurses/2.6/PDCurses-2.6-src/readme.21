                             PDCurses 2.1
                  (Public Domain Curses for DOS, OS/2 and UNIX)


INTRODUCTION:

	The first thing that obviously needs mentioning is the title above.
	The current code contains bug fixes for the DOS and OS/2 releases
	and also includes an alpha release for Unix. The Unix release uses
	another public domain package (mytinfo) to handle the low-level
	screen writes. mytinfo was posted to comp.sources.unix (or misc) in
	December 1992 or January 1993. Unless you are a glutton for punishment
	I would recommend you avoid the Unix port at this stage.
	
	The other major addition to PDCurses is the support for DJGPP (the
	DOS port of GNU C++). Thanks to David Nugent (davidn@csource.oz.au).
	
	Other additions are copywin() function, function debugging support
	and getting the small and medium memory models to work.
	The testcurs.c demo program has also been changed significantly and
	a new demo program, tuidemo, has been added.
	
	Some people have suggested including information on where to get
	dmake from. oak.oakland.edu in /pub/msdos/c
	
OTHER NOTES:
	
	Under DOS, by default, screen writes to a CGA monitor are done via
	the video BIOS rather than by direct video memory writes. This is
	due to the CGA "snow" problem. If you have a CGA monitor and do not
	suffer from snow, you can compile private\_queryad.c with CGA_DIRECT
	defined. This will then use cause PDCurses to write directly to the
	CGA video memory.

	Function debugging: Firstly to get function debugging, you have to
	compile the library with OPT=N in the makefile. This also turns on
	compiler debugging. You can control when you want PDCurses to write
	to the debug file (called trace in the current directory) by using
	the functions traceon() and traceoff() in your program.

	Microsoft C 6.00 Users note:
	----------------------------
	With the addition of several new functions, using dmake to compile 
	PDCurses now causes the compiler to run "out of heap space in pass 2".
	Using the 6.00AX version (DOS-Extended) to compile PDCurses fixes
	this problem; hence the -EM switch.

	Functional changes
	------------------
	A few curses functions have been fixed to exhibit their correct 
	behaviour and make them more functionally portable with System V
	curses.
	The functions that have changed are overlay(), overwrite() and
	typeahead.

	overlay() and overwrite()
	Both of theses functions in PDCurses 2.0 allowed for one window to
	be effectively placed on top of another, and the characters in the
	first window were overlayed or overwritten starting at 0,0 in both
	windows. This behaviour of these functions was not correct. These
	functions only operate on windows that physically overlap with
	respect to the displayed screen. To achieve the same functionality
	as before, use the new function copywin(). See the manual page for
	further details.

	typeahead()
	This function in PDCurses 2.0 effectively checked to see if there
	were any characters remaining in the keyboard buffer. This is not
	the behaviour exhibited by System V curses. This function is intended
	purely to set a flag so that curses can check while updating the
	physical screen if any keyboard input is pending. To achieve the
	same effect with typeahead() under PDCurses 2.1 the following code 
	should be used.

	In place of...

		while(!typeahead(stdin))
		 {
			/* do something until any key is pressed... */
		 }

	use...

		nodelay(stdscr,TRUE); /* getch() to return ERR if no key pending */
		while(getch() == (ERR))
		 {
			/* do something until any key is pressed... */
		 }
