                    Welcome to PDCurses !

 This file provides information on installing PDCurses on DOS, OS/2,
 Win95/NT or for X11 and building the PDCurses library.

 The first step is to unpack the archive. (You've already done that!)

 Next, go to the section below for the platform you intend to build
 the software on, and follow the steps there.

 OS2
 ---
 . cd to the OS2 directory in the directory in which PDCurses was
   unpacked.
 . You will find a number of .mak files in this directory, one for
   each supported compiler.  These following lists the make file
   and compiler:

         gccos2.mak - emx 0.9b+
         iccos2.mak - C Set/2
         bccos2.mak - Borland C++ 2.0
         wccos2.mak - Watcom 10.6
         mscos2.mak - Microsoft C 6.0

 . Create a directory somewhere in which you want the object, library
   and demo executables to be built.
 . cd to that directory.
 . Copy the appropriate makefile to this directory.
 . Edit this makefile, and make a few changes to paths that point to
   the location of the PDCurses code and your compiler. The lines
   you need to change are:

        PDCURSES_HOME=
        CC_HOME=

 . Make the required targets using the options specified at the top
   of the makefile.

 . Thats it!


 DOS
 ---
 . cd to the DOS directory in the directory in which PDCurses was
   unpacked.
 . You will find a number of .mak files in this directory, one for
   each supported compiler.  These following lists the make file
   and compiler:

         gccdos.mak   - DJGPP V2
         bccdos.mak   - Borland C++ 3.0+
         wccdos16.mak - Watcom 10.6 (16bit)
         wccdos4g.mak - Watcom 10.6 (32bit)
         mscdos.mak   - Microsoft C 6.0

 . Create a directory somewhere in which you want the object, library
   and demo executables to be built.
 . cd to that directory.
 . Copy the appropriate makefile to this directory.
 . Edit this makefile, and make a few changes to paths that point to
   the location of the PDCurses code and your compiler. The lines
   you need to change are:

        PDCURSES_HOME=
        CC_HOME=
        MODEL=   (if your compiler supports memory models)

 . Make the required targets using the options specified at the top
   of the makefile.

 . Thats it!


 Win95/NT
 --------
 . cd to the WIN32 directory in the directory in which PDCurses was
   unpacked.
 . You will find a number of .mak files in this directory, one for
   each supported compiler.  These following lists the make file
   and compiler:

         gccwin32.mak   - Cygnus GNU Compiler
         bccwin32.mak   - Borland C++ 4.0.2+
         vcwin32.mak    - Visual C++ 2.0+
         wccwin32.mak   - Watcom 10.6

 . Create a directory somewhere in which you want the object, library
   and demo executables to be built.
 . cd to that directory.
 . Copy the appropriate makefile to this directory.
 . Edit this makefile, and make a few changes to paths that point to
   the location of the PDCurses code and your compiler. The lines
   you need to change are:

        PDCURSES_HOME=
        CC_HOME=

 . Make the required targets using the options specified at the top
   of the makefile.

 . Thats it!


 X11
 ---

 To install PDCurses for X (aka XCurses), follow these instructions.

 Run the configure script that is in the PDCurses-x.x directory. This
 will interrogate your system and check that you have the necessary 
 support XCurses requires.

 If configure cannot find your X include files or X libraries, you can
 specify the paths with --x-includes=inc_path or --x-libraries=lib_path
 as arguments to the configure script.

 configure also recognises the --with-debug[=yes|no] switch. By default
 the library and demo programs are built with the optimiser switch; -O.
 You can turn this off and debugging (-g) on by adding --with-debug to the
 configure command.

 Once configure has run, run "make". This should make the XCurses library,
 the panels library and all demo programs in the demos directory.

 Alternately, you can cd to "pdcurses" directory, and run "make" from
 here.  This will build libpdcurses.a only.
