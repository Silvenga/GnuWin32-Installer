                             PDCurses 2.3
            (Public Domain Curses for DOS, OS/2, X11 and Win32)


INTRODUCTION:

This release of PDCurses includes the following changes:

- the X11 port is now fully functional
- the MS Visual C++ Win32 port now includes a DLL
- both the X11 and Win32 ports support the mouse
- the slk..() functions are now functional
- support for scrollbars under X11 are experimental at this stage

The name of the statically built library is pdcurses.lib (or pdcurses.a).  
The name of the DLL import library (where applicable) is curses.lib.

BUGS FIXED:

some minor bugs were corrected in this release

NEW FUNCTIONS:

slk..() functions


NEW COMPILER SUPPORT:

- MS Visual C++ under Win95/NT
- Watcom C++ under OS/2, Win32 and DOS
- two EMX ports have been provided:
  - OS/2 only using OS/2 APIs
  - OS/2 and DOS using EMX video support routines

Makefiles for each platform/compiler option reside in the platform
directory.  These all have an extension of .mak.


EXTRA OPTIONS:

PDCurses recognises two environment variables which determines the
initialisation and finalisation behaviour.  These environment variables
do not apply to the X11 port.

 PDC_PRESERVE_SCREEN
If this environment variable is set, PDCurses will not clear the screen
to the default white on black on startup.  This allows you to overlay
a window over the top of the existing screen background.

 PDC_RESTORE_SCREEN
If this environment variable is set, PDCurses will take a copy of the
contents of the screen at the time that PDCurses is started; initscr(),
and when endwin() is called, the screen will be restored.
