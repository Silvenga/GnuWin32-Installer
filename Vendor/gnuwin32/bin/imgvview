## imgvview.sh
##	Very simple viewer script for Image Viewer PDB files.  This
##	converts the image to a temporary pgm file and launches
##	a pgm viewer (xli, xv, or display (from Image Magick) will
##	work here).  This script makes it a bit easier to wire the
##	pdb files into your web browser or just to view them from the
##	command line.
