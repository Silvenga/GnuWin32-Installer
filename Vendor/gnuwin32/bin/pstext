# This script uses nenscript as a direct replacement for the Adobe pstext
# utility. By using nenscript, you also get the capability set set headers
# and lots of other nice things, but this vanilla script just does the basic
# ascii to postscript conversion
#
#	-p-	output to stdout, rather than trying to find a printer
#	-B	don't print headings
